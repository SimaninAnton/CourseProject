Description of the issue
HTTP(S) proxy auto-configuration via docker's client config.json file is broken/missing or ambiguous.
According to the following documentation :
docs.docker.com/network/proxy
Adding proxy configuration in $DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json (by default $HOME/.docker/config.json if not set) shall make docker client set automatically proxy environment variables in containers when building or running them.
docker run does populate proxy environment variables as expected in the container run.
docker-compose up does not populate proxy environment variables as expected in the container run.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Try proxy access by running docker run busybox wget -O- example.com, it works.
Result
<!doctype html>
<...> # Truncated HTML content
Here is a matching docker-compose file.
Output of docker-compose config
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    image: 'busybox:latest'
    restart: always
    hostname: 'localhost'
    command: sh -c "echo HTTP_PROXY=$$HTTP_PROXY && wget -O- example.com"
Try proxy access by running docker-compose up, it does not work.
Result
Attaching to busybox_test_1
test_1  | HTTP_PROXY=
test_1  | Connecting to example.com (93.184.216.34:80)
test_1  | wget: can't connect to remote host (93.184.216.34): Connection refused
busybox_test_1 exited with code 1
Workaround: I now populate proxy environment variables directly in the docker-compose file.
Output of docker-compose config
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    image: 'busybox:latest'
    restart: always
    hostname: 'localhost'
    environment:
      HTTP_PROXY: '$HTTP_PROXY'
      HTTPS_PROXY: '$HTTPS_PROXY'
      NO_PROXY: '$NO_PROXY'
      http_proxy: '$http_proxy'
      https_proxy: '$https_proxy'
      no_proxy: '$no_proxy'
    command: sh -c "echo HTTP_PROXY=$$HTTP_PROXY && wget -O- google.com"
HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY, http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy environment variables are all set on the docker host machine.
Try proxy access by running docker-compose up with a workaround, it works.
Result
Attaching to withproxy_test_1
test_1  | HTTP_PROXY=http://10.0.2.2:3128
test_1  | Connecting to 10.0.2.2:3128 (10.0.2.2:3128)
test_1  | <!doctype html>
test_1  | <...> # Truncated HTML content
withproxy_test_1 exited with code 0
Expected result
In step 2, proxy environment variables should have been set automatically with the values specified in docker's client config.json.
Additional information
Issue #5601 and pull request #5706 (merged) indicate that the functionality is already implemented, however I have found no way to make this feature work neither I have found any documentation link.
