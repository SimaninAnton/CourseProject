Description of the issue
The execution of following code snippet leads mostly to the error shown below.
import docker
from compose.cli.command import project_from_options

client = docker.from_env()
try:
    client.images.remove("alpine:latest")
except:
    pass

project = project_from_options(".", {})
project.services[0].pull()
project.services[0].image()
Explanation
When an image pull HTTP request is sent to the docker daemon, the daemon answers with three events:
curl -sS --no-buffer --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -XPOST "http:/v1.35/images/create?tag=latest&fromImage=alpine"
{"status":"Pulling from library/alpine","id":"latest"}
{"status":"Digest: sha256:46e71df1e5191ab8b8034c5189e325258ec44ea739bba1e5645cff83c9048ff1"}
{"status":"Status: Image is up to date for alpine:latest"}
When project.services[0].pull() is executed, the image digest is returned before the last event was successfully sent.
compose/compose/progress_stream.py
Lines 100 to 108 in c956785
 def get_digest_from_pull(events): 
     for event in events: 
         status = event.get('status') 
         if not status or 'Digest' not in status: 
             continue 
            _, digest = status.split(':', 1) 
         return digest.strip() 
     return None 

While the daemon is still busy answering the request, the second function project.services[0].image() is called in parallel and often fails because the image pull has not been finally finished.
