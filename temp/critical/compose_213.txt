Description of the issue
docker-compose build fails when image name contains capital letters (maybe related to #1416). However, the error message returned is
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
when running locally or
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost - is it running?
If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
if running on a drone server.
I only figured this out once I tried running
docker build -t url.com/proj/REPO_WITH_CAPS/img:latest
and got the useful message:
invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase
