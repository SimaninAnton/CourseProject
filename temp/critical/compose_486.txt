Make env_file and secrets file compatible
Then we can use something like:
version: "3.5"

services:

  helloworld:
    image: tutum/hello-world
    ports:
      - 80:80
    env_file:
     - /run/secrets/my_secret
    secrets:
      - my_secret

secrets:
  my_secret:
    file: ./my_secret.txt
and get the environment variable like my_secret=secret_value
Or maybe something like env_secret: (just like env_file:)?
