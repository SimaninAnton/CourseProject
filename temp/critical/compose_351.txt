Description of the issue
Hello. I would like to scale my service, so I specified port range in docker-compose.yml, like this:
version: '2.2'
  
services:
 webserver:
  image: httpd
  ports:
   - "8000-8010:80"
The point is that each time I repeat
docker-compose up -d 
docker-compose down
I have different port on host machine: it is 8000 for the first attempt, 8001 for the second and then 8002, 8003 and so on.

Steps to reproduce the issue
docker-compose up -d
Check that port is 8000
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Check that port is 8001 (unexpected!)
docker-compose down
Observed result
Port increments each time I do docker-compose up
Expected result
The initial port should be the first port from specified range
