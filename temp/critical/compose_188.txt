Looks like content on NFS does not updates when we change NFS server ip and redeploy docker stack. I see old content inside volume connected to container.

      device: ":/home"
Steps to reproduce the issue
Deploy services using docker stack deploy command
Connect to nginx container and check, that NFS volume was attached to /data-2 inside this container.
Change NFS ip to 10.0.0.1 (second NFS server)
Deploy stack
Checked that NFS volume was attached to /data-2 but has content from first (10.10.10.10) NFS share.
Observed result
NFS does not update volume data, after pointing to another server.
Expected result
New data in /data-2 volume.
Additional information
Was tested on Centos 7, and Gentoo.
