Description of the issue
Extension fields defined in one -f file are not available in subsequent -f files, making it impossible to factor out common definitions into a base "defs" file that would be used by multiple other "compositions".
docker-compose-defs.yml:
...
x-phpservice-def:
    &phpservice-def
    image: 'foo.bar.baz'
    volumes:
        - ./themes:/themes
        - ./storage:/storage
    networks:
        - somenetwork
...
docker-compose-dev.yml:
...
services:
  some-service:
    <<: *phpservice-def
    entrypoint:
      - command
      - some
      - arguments
...
When running:
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-defs.yml -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml --project-directory="." up
Expected result:
No errors, the service should go up.
Actual result:
ERROR: yaml.composer.ComposerError: found undefined alias 'phpservice-def'
  in "././docker-compose-dev.yml", line 14, column 9
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version

Output of docker version

Output of docker-compose config
(predictably, the same error message as with up)
