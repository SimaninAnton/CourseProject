The --ignore-pull-failures flag still exits non-zero when failing to pull.
I've found this old bug report which was never solved either: #4377
See example
pieters@Pieters-MacBook-Pro ~ $ docker-compose -f code/property-core-backend/test.yml pull --ignore-pull-failures
Pulling php-fpm ... error

ERROR: for php-fpm  pull access denied for thiswontexistanywhereihope, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
