Description of the issue
Just trying out the new SSH connection introduced in Docker 18.09 and I noticed an error when attempting to do docker-compose up whilst targeting a remote Docker Engine instance.
Errors message below appears to indicate that Compose isn't aware of the SSH protocol for this purpose
docker.errors.DockerException: Invalid bind address protocol: ssh://xfoxy.secinternal.local
[486] Failed to execute script docker-compose
