Description of the issue
I see to be running into either #2839 or #6369. I have a compose file and a named override file and when using multiple -f to merge them, the latter cannot find the defined network from the first.
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.5"

services:
  web1:
    image: nginx
    container_name: web1
    networks:
      webnetwork:

networks:
  webnetwork:
# something.yml
version: "3.5"

services:
  web2:
    image: nginx
    container_name: web2
    networks:
      webnetwork:

version: '3.5'
Steps to reproduce the issue
In the default compose file, add a network and a service that uses that network.
In a separate compose override file, add a service that uses the network defined in the main compose file.
Run docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f youroverride.yml up
Observed result
Services cannot attach to networks defined by earlier compose files.
Expected result
Services defined in latter compose override files can attach to networks defined earlier in the file specification chain.
