Description of the issue
When I run "docker-compose up", it doesn't seem to be able to find the docker module. I definitely have it installed, and I've also tried moving everything into a virtualenv, and changing the version of python I am using (from 3.5.2 to 3.6.7).
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose==1.23.1
Output of docker version
docker==3.5.1
Output of docker-compose config
(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
services:
  tesseract:
    build:
      context: /home/j/PycharmProjects/tesseract-manager/app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a new virtualenv
pip install docker and docker-compose
docker-compose up
Observed result
See below
Expected result
docker-compose to succeed
