Description of the issue
Because the line 1790 asks for a flag
command_builder.add_flag("--progress", self._progress)
and not for an argument,
command_builder.add_arg("--progress", self._progress)
this stack trace is created.
Possible Solution:
Replace flag with arg and we will don't have a stack trace.
