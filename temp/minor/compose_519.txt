Description of the issue
After running docker compose up, volumes are not visible.
I'm logging with docker run -it CONTAINERNAME bash but the files are not there
Output of "docker-compose version"

Steps to reproduce the issue
steps to reproduce:
github repository with files I'm using
https://github.com/janmyszkier/dockerize-app
docker compose up
docker container ls
docker run -it nginx:1.10.3 bash
(inside the container) ls -al /etc/nginx
Observed result
myapp volume / folder is NOT in /etc/nginx
ls -a /etc/nginx/
.  ..  conf.d  fastcgi_params  koi-utf koi-win  mime.types  modules  nginx.conf  scgi_params  uwsgi_params  win-utf
Expected result
myapp volume / folder is available in /etc/nginx
ls -a /etc/nginx/
.  ..  conf.d  fastcgi_params  koi-utf koi-win  mime.types  modules  myapp  nginx.conf  scgi_params  uwsgi_params  win-utf
Stacktrace / full error message
N/A
Additional information
Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS
based on what I could read on docker docs volume is correctly set up in docker-compose.yml file
Doc I'm referring to:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
which shows how to define volumes for a service (which my container is under)
running docker-compose build and docker-compose up doesn't solve the issue
restarting docker service doesn't solve the issue
