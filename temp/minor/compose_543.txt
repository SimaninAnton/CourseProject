Description of the issue
When supplying the docker-compose.yml-File via piping, you cannot specify another file with -f.
This makes overriding configs from for example docker-app hard, because you need to create temporary files.
Context information
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create two configs: docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml (which overrides some values in the first one)
cat docker-compose.yml | docker-compose -f - -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
Observed result
ERROR: .FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './-'
Expected result
It starts the instance.
Additional information
macOS High Sierra, installed via SH (I think).
