need to get access to my media and download folders
tried a symlink from ~/docker/shared/M2 to /disks/M2
volumes:
- ${USERDIR}/docker/shared/M2:/M2
but I'm guessing the container has no access to the drive
ERROR: for sickchill Cannot start service sickchill: error while creating mount source path '/home/stevensr/docker/shared/M2': mkdir /home/stevensr/docker/shared/M2: file exists
I'm mostly winging this docker install i have 12 containers running with traefik as a reverse proxy
just need access to my drives
