I am trying to run gravitee-AM from command line in docker with the following
$ curl -L http://bit.ly/graviteeio-am | bash -s 8080
It still gives me the error
WARNING: The PORT variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.nginx.ports is invalid: Port ranges don't match in length
If I just run
curl -L http://bit.ly/graviteeio-am | bash
without specufying the port I still get the error
How can I run gravitee AM from docker with this error ?
