I was doing the django-shop tutorial from this link:https://django-shop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/quickstart.html . I am very new in docker ,docker-compose and linux .
I get this error:
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http://127.0.0.1:2375 - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
When I execute these commands...
$ git clone --depth 1 github.com/awesto/django-shop
$ cd django-shop
$ export DJANGO_SHOP_TUTORIAL=commodity
$ docker-compose up --build -d
I tried to do this Tutorial and this didn't work.
