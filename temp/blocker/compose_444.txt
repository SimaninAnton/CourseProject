Description of the issue
Usages of PATH_JOKER regex in docker-compose config interpolation logic are in conflict with services whose name contains dot.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of "docker-compose version"
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880f
docker-py version: 3.5.0
CPython version: 3.4.6
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j-fips 26 Sep 2016
Steps to reproduce the issue
Given the sample docker-compose.yaml file with a service named app.0:
version: "3"
services:
  app.0:
    image: redis
    ulimits:
      nofile:
        soft: ${APP_NOFILE}
        hard: ${APP_NOFILE}
Given the sample .env file:
APP_NOFILE=10000
Call docker-compose config
Observed result
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yaml' is invalid because:
services.app.0.ulimits.nofile.soft contains "10000", which is an invalid type, it should be an integer
Expected result
services:
  app.0:
    image: redis
    ulimits:
      nofile:
        hard: 10000
        soft: 10000
version: '3.0'
