Description of the issue
At some point after working on a compose project a couple night ago, compose ceased to work for my non-root user. Prior to the issue, as my user (member of docker group on a debian 9 server), I could use docker-compose to my heart's content, and I was using down, up, build, etc without issue over and over. At some point that night (I don't recall what, if anything changed), I could no longer use docker-compose. Running the command, at all, with or without arguments returns
_bisect.so could not be extracted!
fopen: Permission denied
Since then, I tried reloading the docker daemon, upgrading to the latest debian stable release for docker, and the latest docker-compose release as well. The issue has since persisted. However, as root, i can run and interact with docker-compose without issue (which is how I have the debug info requested below).
I haven't really seen anyone else having this issue, and unfortunately I don't have a very clear log of the changes that happened when the issue showed up, so I am out of ideas.

Try to run docker-compose as the non-root user
Sorry I can't be more specific about what I changed when things started working, if I knew it'd be here. Please feel free to ask for anything relevant.
