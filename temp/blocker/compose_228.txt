Hi all, I am having problem trying to get configs to be deployed together with my running containers. I would expect settings to appear on the root like C:\settings. However, I don't seem to see it.
Here is a copy of my docker-compose.yml. Any help would be great Thanks.
Command used :-
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml mycontainerWithSettings
docker-compose.yml
version: "3.3"
services:
webapi:
image: mylocalrepository-image:0.1.0-image-tagging0293
configs:
- source: appsetting
target: C:\settings\mysettings.shared.default.yml
environment:
- ENVIRONMENT.CATEGORY=DEV
- ENVIRONMENT.INSTANCE=MYMACHINE
- SETTINGS.SHAREDPATH=C:\settings\mysettings.shared.default.yml
ports:
- "5000:5000"
configs:
appsetting:
file : mysettings.shared.default.yml
