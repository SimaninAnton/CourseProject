Description of the issue
While I am trying to utilize ssh socket for deploying docker services with docker-compose, I find out the error in the console.
When I deploy the docker services with docker-compose up the console hung-up, also when I execute docker-compose up -d docker-compose produces the exception and print it to the console.
In the meantime, it works like a charm with the docker stack deploy -c stack.yml STACK_NAME.
