Description of the issue
Similar to the bug reported in #6981 during pre-release, it appears that all piping of compose files into docker-compose is resulting in an error.

    image: busybox
version: '3.3'
Steps to reproduce the issue
cat docker-compose.yaml | docker-compose -f - up (which works in 1.24.x when docker-compose.yaml is a valid compose file)
Observed result
The compose process fails (trace included below)
Expected result
The compose process should be the same as docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up (which still works as expected)
