Description of the issue
This issue relates to changes introduced by /pull/6134
The understanding is that --project-directory will allow you run start up a docker-compose from another directory by specifying the 'project directory'. The understanding is that it will also load the .env file within that directory.
This pull request is only included in the latest release so ensure you're using docker-compose from docker/compose@1.23.0-rc3 (release).
