Hi!
I like docker-compose a lot, many thanks for it!
Description of the issue
I ran into an issue with restart: unless-stopped earlier today that seems like bug in docker-compose to me. The issue is that for a service that has restart: unless-stopped in docker-compose.yml, if I run one-off commands using docker-compose run SERVICE [COMMAND] [ARGS...] there are containers of state Restarting left behind, one per call. Since it does not occur with restart: "no", I think that's rather unexpected undesired behaviour confliciting with the documented "one-off" nature of the run command.
Please see below for a full shell session to demonstrate the issue.
I image a fix could be to have docker-compose send restart: "no" to the Docker daemon instead, when using the run command. What do you think?
