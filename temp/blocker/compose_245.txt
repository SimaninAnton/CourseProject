Description of the issue
docker-compose does not work with dockerd via ssh. It says that Authentication (publickey) failed.. But at the same time, docker via cli works fine.
$ DOCKER_HOST=ssh://ubuntu@xxx docker version
...provides correct output for the remote server

$ DOCKER_HOST=ssh://ubuntu@xxx docker-compose up
