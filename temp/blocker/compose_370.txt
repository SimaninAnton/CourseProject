Description of the issue
DockerComposeCommandExecutor does not works properly on Windows Folder due its folder constructor
Context information (for bug reports)
Docker-compose extensions does not execcutes any command, and returns an error.
Output of docker-compose version
0.3.2
Output of docker version
Failed to execute script docker-compose
I found that on windows hosts the file does not works properly. On file Provider.ts constructor it initializes
DockerComposeCommandExecutor(name, files, shell, folder.uri);`
On Windows "folder.uri" is /C:/Users/SomeUser/ProjectFoler (with slash at start) However it does not works on shell. It must NOT HAVE the slash at start. : C:/Users/SomeUser/ProjectFoler
I made a quick fix on the go on my windows VsCode removing the initial slash
DockerComposeCommandExecutor(name, files, shell, folder.uri.path.substring(1));
(removing the first slash) and it works,
It must have to check if hots is windows and give it propper file.
