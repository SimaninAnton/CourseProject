Description of the issue
We use docker-compose up in our CI environment to build and deploy a stack of services, on which we then perform some tests. After the tests are ran we use docker-compose down --rmi all -v to clean up the deployed stack of services.
What we have noticed that after we use docker-compose down --rmi all -v the base images that are used by the services aren't cleaned up. While looking at the documentation of --rmi all it states:
Remove all images used by any service
With this I would assume that when we use docker_compose down --rmi all that there should be no images left behind.
