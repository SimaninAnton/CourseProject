Description of the issue
When running docker-compose up over an SSH connection, i.e. DOCKER_HOST is set to ssh://user@my-site.com, the .env file is not used.
For example when using the compose file
version: '2'
services:
  mail:
    image: tvial/docker-mailserver:latest
    hostname: ${HOSTNAME}
    domainname: ${DOMAINNAME}
    container_name: ${CONTAINERNAME}
    ports:
    - "25:25"
    - "143:143"
    - "587:587"
    - "993:993"
    environment:
    - DMS_DEBUG=${DMS_DEBUG}
and a .env file
HOSTNAME=my-host
DOMAINNAME=my-domain.com
CONTAINER_NAME=mail
DMS_DEBUG=0
all values sourced from the .env file will be empty strings and docker-compose up logs out
The HOSTNAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
The DOMAINNAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
The CONTAINER_NAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
The DMS_DEBUG variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
This worked fine before moving to an SSH deployment.

As this is on a CI server I can't get this easily I'm afraid.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a simple docker-compose file and .env file that sets an environment variable from the .env file.
Run docker-compose up on the file over an SSH connection to a remote server.
Exec into the container and examine the contents of the environment variable.
Observed result
The environment variable is empty.
Expected result
The environment variable contains the contents specified in the .env file.
