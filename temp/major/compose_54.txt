Description of the issue
Environment variables do not seem to be applied correctly.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064
Output of docker version
Docker version 18.06.3-ce, build d7080c1
Output of docker-compose config
WARNING: The COMMIT_REF variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
networks:
  internal:
    external: false
  web:
    external: true
services:
  drupal:
    container_name: <redacted>
    image: <redacted>-
    networks:
      internal: null
      web: null
    restart: always
version: '3.3'
Steps to reproduce the issue
Using the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '3.1'
networks:
  web:
    external: true
  internal:
    external: false
services:
  web:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/<redacted>:backend-${COMMIT_REF}
When I try to use pull or up, I get:
sudo COMMIT_REF=xxx docker-compose --file docker-compose.yml pull
WARNING: The COMMIT_REF variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Pulling <redacted>   ... error
ERROR: for <redacted>  manifest for registry.gitlab.com/<redacted>- not found
ERROR: manifest for registry.gitlab.com/<redacted>- not found
I thought it might be related to the use of sudo, so I tried sudo A=B env, but A still showed up in the output, so I'm fairly certain the env var is being set.
Observed result
Docker-compose thinks that $COMMIT_REF env var does not exist and thus defaults to an empty string.
Expected result
Docker-compose should have pulled the image ending with $COMMIT_REF.
