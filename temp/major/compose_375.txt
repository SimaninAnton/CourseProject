Description of the issue
This seems to be a repeat of #5871 . There's a version 1.23.2 on PyPI but the changelog was last updated for 1.23.0: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
This is not reassuring - both from an upgrade perspective (I want to be sure the new version won't need changes on my codebase) and security (is the new version legitimate?).
