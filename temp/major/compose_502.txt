Description of the issue
When using an .env file, variables with underscores do not get resolved in the 'image:' directive during docker-compose up
Context information (for bug reports)
I wish to provide a dynamic tag name for the image used in docker-compose. A .env file is generated during the workflow and the variable used in the docker-compose.yml. Here are my files:
.env:
MY_TAG=mytag
docker-compose.yml:
...
services:
  myservice:
    env_file: 
      - .env
    image: "repo-url/image-name:${MY_TAG}"
...

Steps to reproduce the issue
Create an env file with a variable containing an underscore
Add a container definition using the variable as the image tag
Run docker-compose config
Observed result
services:
  myservice:
    environment:
      MY_TAG: mytag
    image: repo-url/image-name:latest
version: '3.0'
Expected result
services:
  myservice:
    environment:
      MY_TAG: mytag
    image: repo-url/image-name:mytag
version: '3.0'
Additional information
Removing the underscore makes it work as expected.
