Hello.
I am not good at English, so it may be funny.
I am trying to edit wordpress theme by starting wordpress with docker.
The following is docker-compose.yml. ↓
// docker-compose.yml ↓
version: '2'
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql: 5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_pw
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: mysql_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: mysql_pw
    restart: always
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress: latest
    ports:
    - "3001: 80"
    volumes:
    - ./wordpress: /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/wordpress
    -. /www:/var/www/html
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: mysql_user
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: mysql_pw
I tried editing by putting a theme folder in the directory "wordpress".
However, when index.php is rewritten as shown below, the following error is displayed on the image file.
// index.php ↓
hello world
// console.log error ↓
GET http: // localhost: 3001 / screenshot.png 404 (Not Found)
The installation of wordpress succeeded successfully, we are also changing the theme.
http: // localhost: 3001 / displays "hello world" and icons of images that can not be read.
screenshot.png is located at the same level as index.php.
So, the image path is not wrong.
The same error (GET http: // localhost: 3001 / *. Js 404 (Not Found)) is displayed even if you try to read *. Js file as an external file, for example, as well as an image file.
I think that this error is caused because the volumes of docker-compose.yml are not properly mounted between the host and the container.
However, I do not know how to confirm whether it is mounted or how to set it correctly.
What is causing this error?
How can I avoid errors?
