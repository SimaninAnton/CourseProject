In my docker-compose configuration I mount AWS EFS volumes
volumes:
      - fs-xxxxxx:/root
Since few days I'm getting the error Volume fs-xxxx .specifies nonexistent driver efs. According to the exception
except NotFound:
            raise ConfigurationError(
                'Volume %s specifies nonexistent driver %s' % (volume.name, volume.driver)
            )
here
compose/compose/volume.py
Line 161 in 7ae632a
 except NotFound: 
I'm getting a Volume fs-xxxx .specifies nonexistent driver efs error while initializing the containers.
Looking at the initialize code there could be different root causes of this (maybe in volume.create() or maybe check_remote_volume_config, etc.), and assumed that it is not a ConfigurationError, how to check which is the exact cause that raises that exception?
