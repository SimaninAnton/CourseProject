Description of the issue
Context information (for bug reports)
Since #6406, volumes handling is a bit unpredictable, and as things are moving, i want to be sure of the wanted behavior not to face more regressions in the future.
Steps to reproduce the issue
From #6406
This config should fail
version: "3.7"
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
    - test:/test
    - 2test:/test
volumes:
  test:
  2test:
But are we agreeing than this one would never fail ?
version: "3.7"
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
    - test:/test
    - ./dev:/test
volumes:
  test:
Idea being the scene is to allow simple prod/dev configs should still be supported as-is:
docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
    - test:/test
volumes:
  test:
docker-compose-dev.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  test:
    volumes:
    - ./dev:/test
and use it with docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml
