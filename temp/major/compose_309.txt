When using one environment variable in different places of compose-file, you have to specify it's default value in every place, you use it. My real case are:
orchestra:
  volumes:
    - ${TMP:-/tmp/}/my_docker/:${TMP:-/tmp/}/my_docker/
  environment:
    - TMP: ${TMP:-/tmp/}/my_docker
This leads to extra code growing and more mistakes.
I do not know would be my suggestion suitable for docker-compose philosophy, but there no reason to specify different default values for the same variable ind different places.
So in my opinion it will be a good idea to make docker-compose to use the default value of first variable appearance in other places. When the second default value specified, docker-compose should breaks with error in case it differs from the first. The last one needed for backward compatibility and extra verification of old docker-compose files. According this the above examples may looks next:
orchestra:
  volumes:
    - ${TMP:-/tmp/}/my_docker/:$TMP/my_docker/
  environment:
    - TMP: $TMP/my_docker
Another way is to add new option with default environment variables values, which modifies the docker-compose environment prior running other options. There could be two options: one for variables which is not exists and another for variables which is not exists or empty. For example:
orchestra:
  env_defaults_empty:
    - TMP: /tmp/ #used when TMP is unset or empty in the environment
  env_default_absent:
    - VARIABLE: "val" #used when VARIABLE is unset in the environment
  volumes:
    - ${TMP:-/tmp/}/my_docker/:$TMP/my_docker/
  environment:
    - TMP: $TMP/my_docker
