My DockerFile starts like this:
ARG BASEIMAGE
FROM ${BASEIMAGE} as base-image
RUN echo ${BASEIMAGE}
........
now, when I do :
docker build --build-arg BASEIMAGE=localimage:v1 .
this works.
But my docker-compose yml which has this:
services:
web:
build:
context: .
dockerfile: service.dockerfile
args:
BASEIMAGE: ''
when I issue command:
docker-compose build --build-arg BASEIMAGE=localimage:v1
this doesn't work and throws the below errors:
Building web Step 1/11 : ARG BASEIMAGE Step 2/11 : FROM ${BASEIMAGE} as base-image ERROR: Service 'web' failed to build: pull access denied for localimage, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.
I know that this is related to issue 6668. But the workaround specified in that doesn't work with "up" command. "--pull-ignore-failures" is not supported with "up" command and I cannot spin up the service(s) at all using the local images.
I am trying to create "dev environment" for my repo and I cannot do that with docker-compose due to this. Idea is to build images locally, test them out by deploying them, then push to Container Registry for further testing if necessary. Now, I cannot do that using docker-compose since local images are not supported.
