Description of the issue
It seems that docker-compose breaks when using a python virtual environment with the --relocatable flag set. Removing --relocatable seems to fix the issues.
I'm not entirely sure if the problem is with Python Virtual Envs or Docker Compose specifically yet, but we have only had a problem with docker-compose at so far. I thought it might be a good idea to have this issue reported here regardless to help others, as the failure message isn't obvious to what the problem is.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version

Steps to reproduce the issue

Attempt to run a docker-compose command, such as docker-compose down
