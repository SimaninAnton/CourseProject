Hi,
I have a service called app_source which is used as data container. I copy application code into /app folder of this container/image and link it with a named volume called data_volume. This named volume is then used by other service called app_php so that the application code is accessible/runnable in it's container. This all works fine at the end of the build process.
The problem I am facing is at build time. When I run ls on /app folder, it seems empty. Hence reason I cannot run specific commands (such as composer install) in Dockerfile. So the question is, is there a solution for /app content availability at build time?
docker-compose.yml
version: "3"

services:

  app_source:
    build:
      context: "../.."
      dockerfile: "docker/source/Dockerfile"
    volumes:
      - "data_volume:/app"

  app_php:
    build:
      context: "./php"
    volumes:
      - "data_volume:/app"
    depends_on:
      - "app_source"

volumes:
  data_volume:
docker/source/Dockerfile
FROM tianon/true

COPY . /app
docker/php/Dockerfile
FROM php:7.2.13-fpm-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app

RUN ls -l /app # This is empty at build time

CMD ["php-fpm", "--nodaemonize"]
At the end of the build
$ sudo ls -la /var/lib/docker/volumes/data_volume/_data/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1443 May 16 20:05 composer.json

$ docker inspect data_volume
