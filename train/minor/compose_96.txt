Description of the issue
The current message is
Service "your_service" uses an undefined secret file "~/compose-test/missing_file", the following folder is created "~/compose-test/missing_file"
When reading the message we could think that docker-compose just created the directory for us which is not the case.
Other point, message will always talk about folder even if we declare a file in the compose file.
Maybe we should have a message more explicit like this :
Service "your_service" uses an undefined secret file "~/compose-test/missing_file", the following folder/file should be created "~/compose-test/missing_file"
