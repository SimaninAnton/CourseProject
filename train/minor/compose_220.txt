While skimming through the documentation of Terraform, I observed a very interesting implementation to how they handle passing in variables (secret keys, passwords, whatever) which are NOT versioned into the terraform config which IS versioned.
Basically, you define a list of variables in a config file, similar to .env. An important difference here is that you can leave any of these variable's values EMPTY.
Whenever you run the actual terraform apply command (equivalent to docker-compose up), the CLI will ask you to fill any empty variables right inside the shell, in an interactive manner.
In contrast to Terraform, the docker-compose up command currently just fails if there are variables defined inside docker-compose.yml, without them being defined inside .env or passed inline to the "up" command (e.g. $ BRANCH=develop docker-compose up). I thought such interactivity like Terraform provides, would certainly make the Docker Compose CLI a bit more user-friendly.
