Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
For development we have several containers we want to use such as postgres, elasticsearch, kibana, etc... and the docker-compose.yml file has several of these as services such as postgres, elasticsearch and kibana. Sometimes we don't want to run kibana as it's mostly used for debugging.
Another scenario is developing microservices where we want a full environment but also the ability to toggle one service off to develop it locally.
Describe the solution you'd like
Adding an --exclude-service flag would allow us to use our existing docker-compose files without having to comment out specific services before running docker-compose to remove specific services.
docker-compose up --exclude-service kibana
Describe alternatives you've considered
Commenting out the services we don't want to start, having multiple docker-compose files that are identical except for each combination of services (impractical when you have several services)
Additional context
I think this is a common request, I found some issues asking for optional services that were somewhat related.
Having --exclude-service along with being able to specify which services to start like this docker-compose up postgres elasticsearch widget-api --exclude-service user-api would work well to allow users to have one master docker-compose.yml file and specify at runtime which services to start.
