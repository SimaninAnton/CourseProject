Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
In version 1.24.1, executes config subcommand and then displays the configuration content of docker-compose.yml.
But the message doesn't include a message indicating validation was successful.
I don't know if configuration validation succeeded or failed.
So, it is better to display like "PASS: Validate the compose file".
Describe the solution you'd like
Make a few changes on compose/cli/main.py#L367:
- print(serialize_config(compose_config, image_digests))

+ successful_msg = 'PASS: Validate the compose file'
+ print('{}\n{}'.format(successful_msg, serialize_config(compose_config, image_digests)))
Thanks
