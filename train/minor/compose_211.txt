Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
We use docker-compose with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch containers during the development process. On our docker-compose.yml file has 3 services: postgres, elasticsearch and kibana. The application uses only PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch. Kibana is used for debugging purpose and we need to use
docker-compose up -d postgres elasticsearch
every time if we don't want to run Kibana.
Describe the solution you'd like
A key, which defines the container as optional in the docker-compose.yml, would be awesome.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Also, I didn't spend a great deal of time on this to search for a way to define optional containers; therefore, there is maybe a way to define it.
Additional context
Here is the docker-compose.yml file that we use.
