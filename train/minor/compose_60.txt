In all files and directories in volumes, that are mounted into container, national characters (the ones with unicode > 127) are shown as a question mark "?". The numver of question marks corresponds to count of byte of each character (for example czech "é" is shown as "??").
The filesystem is local ext4. Characters are dislayed correctly in local tools, also the same paths mounted into container started directly by docker (not through docker-composer but by docker itself), all characters are correct.
The same is observer on remote filesystem mounted via SMBFS.
Observed with docker-compose 1.23, still persists in 1.25.0-rc4
Operation system / docker:
Debian 9, docker 19.03.4,
Opensuse 15, dockr 19.03.1
