It is impossible to run a docker-compose build that will use locally built images and pull updated remote image at the same time.
build --pull will fail on local image.
$ docker-compose build --pull app
Step 1/6 : FROM local-image as local
ERROR: Service 'app' failed to build: pull access denied for local-image, repository does
 not exist or may require 'docker login'
build without --pull won't fetch latest version of other base images.

Output of docker-compose version
# docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.23.1, build b02f130
docker-py version: 3.7.2
CPython version: 2.7.15
OpenSSL version: LibreSSL 2.6.5
Adding --ignore-pull-failures to docker-compose build --pull should be enough to fix the issue. Otherwise a separate builder script is needed to implement the logic without docker-compose.
