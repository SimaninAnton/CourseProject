I have a nexus server that acts as a repo for NPM, Maven and Docker artifacts.
The problem is that for NPM and Maven, for legacy reasons I had to serve all nexus from a different root i.e
[npm]
http://ip:port/nexus/repository/npm/
[maven]
http://ip:port/nexus/repository/maven/
and obviously by extension docker is http://ip:port/nexus/repository/docker/
but when docker tries to do anything it automatically goes as https://ip:port/v2/ which of course results in a 404
I would like a way to specify the full url of the repo in the daemon.json rather than just host + port
if I have anything else after port I cant start the daemon: parsing "8081/nexus/repository/docker": invalid syntax
