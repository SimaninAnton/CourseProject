Docker compose uses PyInstaller for distributing installable packages.
PyInstaller is in urgent need of funding:
If reasonable funding is not achieved for PyInstaller until end of January 2020, @htgoebel will retire as an maintainer. This basically means: Unless somebody else steps in, there will be nobody reviewing any pull-request, there will be not improvement and sooner or later you will not be able to use PyInstaller any more - and open issues in Docker Compose related to PyInstaller might not be solved.
For details see pyinstaller/pyinstaller#4404.
