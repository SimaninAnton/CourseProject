Description of the issue
I've built an image with and entrypoint .sh file. This file cd into a path and calls a python script which is basically a process split in two parallel threads. One is a rest api and the other is a script which interacts with another API.
Context information (for bug reports)
Running the image with docker run -it imagename:tag I've got the right behaviour of the script,
And the terminal shows up the outputs of these 2 threads.
Running this image inside a docker-compose only one of these threads starts, in particular the rest api.
If I try to interact with that in order to activate the features of the second one i can't see any output or interactions.
How can I fix this behavior?
