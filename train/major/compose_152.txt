Hi,
When I try to start "application" containers I get errors below. The reason is because the monitoring_fluent_bit container is not running yet. However, it would be nice if there was an "graceful" start option under logging.options so if the monitoring_fluent_bit container is not running/available yet, the application services should still run. Does that make sense?
Thanks
