I'm unable to start containers because of the error:
'docker-compose ps -q The CIRCLECI variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.' returned exit code 1
            The output was:
            The CIRCLECI variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
            No such service: The CIRCLECI variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Here's a log line which may also help debug the problem:

docker-compose.yml:

      args:
