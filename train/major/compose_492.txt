Description of the issue
When I build images with docker-compose build. For exemple:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
if I have filenames in my env_file key and those files don't exist, I have an error:
"ERROR: Couldn't find env file: /Users/godot/flylab/ipsum/cuvee/bdd.env"
But, correct me if I am wrong, those files are used at instantiation time when you do:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
So why are they required at build time?
In development, it doesn't matter much but, in production, I build my images without a need for a environment context, push them on a repo and then pull them at my client and only then I will add my environment files.
It's no big deal but I hope I am not missing a deeper reason...
