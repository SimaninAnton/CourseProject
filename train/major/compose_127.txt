Description of the issue
Sometimes, when I run docker-compose build, the tag is not applied to the newly built image, but to the base image (FROM line in the Dockerfile).
This happens sporadically, every few weeks. I has happened once that I deployed the nginx base image because of that (instead of the custom image that I built and intended to deploy).

When running docker-compose build on https://github.com/desec-io/desec-stack/blob/747fe7a95915a83fc8560230cc994455d05f56a0/docker-compose.yml, with https://github.com/desec-io/desec-static/blob/a2d436813b8cc34dce203b466ecbd80ccb034ec5/Dockerfile , the output is as follows:
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a directory and copy https://github.com/desec-io/desec-stack/blob/747fe7a95915a83fc8560230cc994455d05f56a0/docker-compose.yml (plus build directories of the services)
Create static/ subdirectory and copy https://github.com/desec-io/desec-static/blob/a2d436813b8cc34dce203b466ecbd80ccb034ec5/Dockerfile there (plus other stuff in that directory)
docker-compose build, then docker images
Observed result
The build proceeds as fllows:
Building static
[...]
Step 15/15 : RUN cp -a dist/. /usr/share/nginx/html && rm -rf /usr/src/app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> e1304267fde2
Successfully built e1304267fde2
Successfully tagged desec/dedyn-static:latest
Sporadically, however, the wrong image gets tagged:
$ docker images | grep static
desec/dedyn-static                      <none>              e1304267fde2        6 days ago          713MB
desec/dedyn-static                      latest              ac44715da54a        5 weeks ago         109MB
The image that got tagged is actually the nginx parent image:
$ docker images | grep nginx
nginx                                   stable              ac44715da54a        5 weeks ago         109MB
Expected result
I expect that the following lines actually mean that e1304267fde2 was tagged as desec/dedyn-static:latest.
Successfully built e1304267fde2
Successfully tagged desec/dedyn-static:latest
