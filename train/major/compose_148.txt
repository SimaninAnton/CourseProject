I tried mount Windows Shared Folder with in container.
So, I wrote docker-compose.yml file below, but mount directory owner is root and writeable only owner user.
version: '3'

services:
  php:
    container_name: php
    build: ./docker/php
    volumes:
    - cifs:/shared
    restart: always

volumes:
  cifs:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: username=(username),password=(password),rw,domain=(domainname),uid=1000,gid=1000
      device: "\\\\(ipaddress)\\shared"
$ sudo docker-compose exec php bash
$ ls -l /
...
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 24 07:27 shared
...
By the way, I executed below command at host.
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=(username),password=(password),domain=(domainname),rw,uid=1000,gid=1000 //(ipaddress)/shared /shared
and I modified docker-compose.yml file below, could mount cifs volume by other than root user.
version: '3'

services:
  php:
    container_name: php
    build: ./docker/php
    volumes:
    - /shared:/shared
    restart: always
$ sudo docker-compose exec php bash
$ ls -l /
...
drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Jun 24 07:27 shared
...
Tell me how to mount cifs volume by other than root user without host mount.
