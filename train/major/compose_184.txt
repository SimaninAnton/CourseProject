Description of the issue
When running docker-compose up over an SSH connection, i.e. DOCKER_HOST is set to ssh://user@my-site.com, any relative volume mounts to the filesystem will not synchronize content.
For example when using the compose file
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      # Can't use ~/static-serve despite being ci user as this doesn't work with docker-compose over SSH
      - /home/ci/static-serve:/var/www/
there is content in the /var/www folder in the container but changing the volume mount to ~/static-serve:/var/www/ results in the /var/www directory in the container being empty. In the DOCKER_HOST variable I am connecting as the ci user.
When not operating over SSH this all works fine.

As this is on a CI server I can't get this easily I'm afraid.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a simple docker-compose file with a volume mount in the format ~/some-host-folder:/some-container-folder
Add a file to ~/some-host-folder
Run docker-compose up on the file over an SSH connection to a remote server.
Exec into the container and examine the contents (or lack thereof!) /some-container-folder
Repeat but change the path from ~/some-host-folder to /home/your-ssh-username/some-host-folder and the file will be present.
Observed result
The /some-container-folder folder in the container contains the file only when the path is absolute (i.e. /home/your-ssh-username/some-host-folder but not ~/some-host-folder).
Expected result
The /some-container-folder folder in the container contains the file when using either path.
