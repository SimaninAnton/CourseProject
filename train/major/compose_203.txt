Description of the issue
using this volume config on a docker compose compose:
.....................
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /media
        target: /media
        bind:
          propagation: 'shared'
      - /system/burning:/media/burning

..........................
will add as mounted the folder "burning" on host (on bash: mount | grep burning will list it), and it will be never marked as unmounted even when the image will be stopped (as expected)
when the service will be update o reinstanced, it will add another mount point to the host (identical) and so on, untill on the host the folder will be mounted so many times that it will start to cause unexpected issues like the unabilities to extract an image or updating systemd services, hang of the df command, etc...
Steps to reproduce the issue
create a service with a shared mountpoint
add to the target mountpoint just created, another volume on the same target
verify that on the host it will appear by listing the mounts
remove or update the service many times untill you can see that trying to pull an image from a registry became impossibile, because the extract process will hang (or try to run systemd commands like stopping/starting services)
mitigation
disable the ability to mount nested folders inside a shared mountpoint
