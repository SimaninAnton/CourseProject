Description of the issue
version 1.25.0 docker-compose pull only pulls 3 out of the 5 images in my docker-compose file. Version 1.24.0 does not have this issue.

(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
Cannot provide this. This includes private repositories, passwords, environment variables, and lists of exposed ports.
Steps to reproduce the issue
write a docker-compose file of 5 images
run docker-compose pull
the Pulling <service>... dialogue may ignore images. If it does, this error is successfully reproduced.
Observed result
3 out of 5 images are pulled
Expected result
All images are pulled
Stacktrace / full error message
None,  docker-compose pull does not pull all of the images I need.
Additional information
When I run docker-compose pull <ignored-service-name>, the image is pulled successfully. without that argument, it is not.
docker-compose config --services prints all of the service names, and docker-compose config does not produce any errors, and v1.24.0 does not have this issue, so my docker-compose file should still be valid.
OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
apt install docker-compose
