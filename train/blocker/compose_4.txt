Hi,
I have installed Docker Desktop for Mac on my Mac with macOS Sierra version 10.12.6
Docker is working fine but when I run "docker-compose --version" to check whether docker-compose is installed properly, it shows the following error:
[8807] Error loading Python lib '/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker-compose/.Python': dlopen: dlopen(/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker-compose/.Python, 10): Symbol not found: _futimens
Referenced from: /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker-compose/.Python
Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
in /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker-compose/.Python
And when I run the command "docker-machine --version", it says command not found.
If you need more information, please let me know. I would appreciate if someone can help me on this as I am trying to use docker for my developments for the first time.
Thanks,
Mahfuz
