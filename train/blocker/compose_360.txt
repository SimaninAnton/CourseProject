I have a jenkins job that builds all my docker images and pushes them to my docker hub. It then ssh to the server on which I want to deploy and runs docker-compose pull && docker-compose up.
For some reason, this mechanism is not handling changes in the dockers well. I changed one of my requirements in one of the images. I can see in jenkins that it recognized the change and did not use the cache for that stage:
    Step 16/33 : RUN ldconfig
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 15284e3997f6
    Step 17/33 : ADD requirements.txt requirements.txt
     ---> 1c2d81548e55
    Step 18/33 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     ---> Running in 679034a149d4
    Collecting alembic==0.9.5 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
you can see here that step 16 was still using cache and step 17 did not. Which is working as expected.
I then push the images:
    -------------
    Publishing Images
    -------------
    
        Pushing base (<docker-hub-server>/base:latest)...
        The push refers to repository [<docker-hub-server>/base].
After that I ssh to the server and pull the image.
The problem is that for some reason, the new image with the updated dependecies was not pushed for some reason.
I tried removing all containers and images both in the jenkins server and in the destination server.
This feels like is something is being cached incorrectly.
After checking in jenkins, the right image is there, but still when I push it says that all layers already exist even though Step 16, 17 were changed.
    The push refers to repository [<docker-hub-server>/base]

Additional information
is there a way to forcefully push the image?
