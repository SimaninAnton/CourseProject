Description of the issue
I'm new to Docker and playing around with Dockerfiles and .yml scripts. I tried to replicate the example on the get started page for compose and when I type either docker-compose up or docker-compose build I get the same error message as follows:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Additional information
Since I'm new to Docker, I'm not too sure where to look for a more extended log for this.
Any help will be greatly appreciated!
OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
