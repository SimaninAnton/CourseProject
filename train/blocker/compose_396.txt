I tried to update compose because of a problem I had that I read was fixed in later versions
I removed copose using:
sudo apt-get remove docker-compose
and then installed the latest version using pip (I also tried other methods)
cannot change profile for the next exec call: No such file or directory
snap-update-ns failed with code 1: No such file or directory
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version gives the same error.
Output of docker version
