Steps to reproduce the issue
docker-compose run alpine
attempt to enter commands at alpine's shell
Observed result
It shows CLI prompt, but does not respond to any input. Ctrl-C returns to normal shell (as if container had been killed), but container keeps running. docker exec <container_name> sh enters container and provides normal interaction. Within that entered shell, ps -ef shows pid 1 with original shell (even if Ctrl-C was used). As far as I can tell, the initial invocation is just not attaching the terminal or something close to that.
This is not connected to alpine; I'm showing alpine just to have a minimal test case. I ran into this with a node container (trying to do docker-compose run node bash).
Expected result
Normal interaction with shell within container.
Stacktrace / full error message
N/A.
Additional information
docker-compose installed as a container, running on Ubuntu 16.04. It works with Docker Compose 1.22.0 but not with any Docker Compose 1.23.x. (I'm not using any new features from 1.23.x, so reverting to 1.22.0 is an ok option for me.)
