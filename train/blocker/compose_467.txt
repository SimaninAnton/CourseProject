Description of the issue
If your docker-compose.yml file contains multiple usages of the same image used for multiple services, then when you docker-compose push it tries to push that image once for every time it is used. The server side processing of this is handled correctly for me, saying layer already exists, but it is still added wasted time as it verifies each layer N times where N = number of times you referenced the image.

Omitting as I haven't made a minimal reproduction, let me know if you need one.
Steps to reproduce the issue
1.Define two services in docker-compose.yml using the same image (specifically a private registry one, but shouldn't matter)
2.run docker-compose push
3.
Observed result
One push per usage of image:tag
Expected result
One push per unique image:tag
