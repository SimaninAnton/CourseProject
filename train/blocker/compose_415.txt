Description of the issue
Upon conversion from the short syntax of volume mounting to the long syntax, paths including environment variables in the source definition of the volume directory are no more properly parsed.
Here is the sample of volume mounting instruction with long syntax:
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: $HOME/app/docker-app/db-data
        target: /data/db
        bind:
          propagate: rshared
The resulting error is:
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.app.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be a string
Here is the prior short syntax that did not raise any errors:
    volumes:
          - $HOME/app/docker-app/db-data:/data/db
Both of the instructions are issued for version: "2" of docker-compose, but the issue remains in version: "3".

ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.app.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be a string
Steps to reproduce the issue
define a docler-compose file containing the following instruction:
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: $HOME/app/docker-app/db-data
        target: /data/db
        bind:
          propagate: rshared
Issuue a docker-compose build
Observed result
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.app.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be a string
Expected result
Proper volume mapping, consistent with short syntax
Stacktrace / full error message
