Description of the issue
Receive a stack trace on build when relative paths are used in the build config. The release prior to this worked fine. I didn't get the version number, but I kept updating with every version that was being automatically downloaded by Docker CE on Windows 10.

OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
Windows 10. Installed by going to https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows , downloading the executable and installing.
Tried every combination of enclosing with single quotes, enclosing with double quotes, reversing the slashes, using \ on the ../../Scripts/Compose/DevWebDockerfile path.
