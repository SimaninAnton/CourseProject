Description of the issue
According to Compose file version 2 reference, version 2.4 is supported on docker 17.12.0+. I am using version 19.03.4 and I can use version 2.3 but not 2.4.
I had to use version 2.4 because, even though the docs say that long syntax for mounts is supported on 2.3+, the docker-compose output didn't agree. I need to use version 2 because #4513

ERROR: Version in "./docker-compose.yaml" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create docker-compose.yaml file with version set to 2.4
Run docker-compose up -d
