Description of the issue
Starting from a clean situation with no running or stopped containers the docker-compose start command (instead of up) reports having started my containers but also reports a (correct) error that there are no containers to start.
Output:
>docker-compose start
Starting server   ... done
Starting frontend ... done
ERROR: No containers to start

Steps to reproduce the issue
Stop and remove all existing containers
Run docker-compose start
Notice contradicting output.
Expected result
I would expect docker to tell me that there are no containers to start. I should run the up command first.
