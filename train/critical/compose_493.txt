ERROR:
Can't find a suitable configuration file in this directory or any
parent. Are you in the right directory?
    Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml
## Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Run Pull command: "**docker pull osrm/osrm-backend**"
2. Download GeoFabrik "**http://download.geofabrik.de/south-america-latest.osm.pbf**" and save past C:/User/osmr
3. Run Command: "**docker run -t -v //c/Users/osrm:/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/south-america-latest.osm.pbf**"

### Observed result
```
Docker asks for network sharing, when typing user and password it closes (as if it was ok) and after it displays the error: "docker: Error response from daemon: An error occurred while sharing drive.".

When I quit Docker and install again, I can quickly share 1 drive! but then the error appears.
Input /data/south-america-latest.osm.pbf file not found.
```
### Expected result
`The result is to initiate the extraction of the file in question generating several files referring to map, streets and roterization`

### Stacktrace / full error message

```
Depending on the moment
docker: Error response from daemon: An error occurred while sharing drive.
and
Input /data/south-america-latest.osm.pbf file not found.
```

## Additional information

WIN 10 PRO.


Installation of the OSRM Project: https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-backend/

The first time I was able to start the partition, but it did not finish due to lack of memory, later I released more memory for the docker and thus began the errors, there were several attempts to uninstall everything and install again, download the files again without success!
