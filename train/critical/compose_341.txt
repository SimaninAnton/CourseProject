Description of the issue
Can't build image if gcloud credHelpers are specified. None of the images is hosted on gcr.
~/.docker/config.json looks like this:
{
  "auths" : {
    "https://gcr.io" : {},
  },
  "credHelpers" : {
    "us.gcr.io" : "gcloud",
    "asia.gcr.io" : "gcloud",
    "gcr.io" : "gcloud",
    "eu.gcr.io" : "gcloud",
    "staging-k8s.gcr.io" : "gcloud"
  },
  "credSstore" : "osxkeychain"
}
Everytime when I build images with compose I just remove credHelpers key from config and everything magically starts to work.
