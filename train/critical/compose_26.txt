Steps to reproduce the issue
Because the default network address of docker conflicts with that of my server, I need to modify the default network address of docker.
Modify the docker0 subnet and gateway as the target address. The following information shows that I have successfully modified it:

built and run the docker-compose with command: docker-compose up -d
Observed result
The subnet addr and gateway of my app didn't change:
Expected result
The subnet addr and gateway of my app should be the same as that of bridge, because this is the bridge mode used
Additional information
In addition, I also tried to create a new network with the following command:
docker network create -d bridge --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.254 test
and use it instead of deafult by change the yml:
networks:
  default:
    driver: test
but anther error occured:
Creating network "onlinejudgedeploy_default" with driver "test"
ERROR: plugin "test" not found
But when I use a single container to connect to the test network, the display is normal
The two windows on the right are before and after launching the container Ubuntu
More interestingly, although I can't modify the default subnet and gateway, I can change the IP by restarting the container:
You can see that the subnet has "+ 1" and become 172.18.0.0/16 from 172.17.0.0.16. Add 1 for each restart. So, 172.18 didn't conflict with my server and my problem was solved. But, why can't I modify the gateway and subnet directly, is this a feature or a bug?
I did the experiments on MacOS 10.13 and CentOS 7.
