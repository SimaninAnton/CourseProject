Description of the issue
Hello community, I'm trying to connect through ssh to a remote server, but docker-compose shows a dependency error.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version

(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
services:
  adminer:
    image: adminer
    ports:
    - 8080:8080/tcp
  db:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    image: postgres
    volumes:
    - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw
version: '3.1'
volumes:
  db: {}
Steps to reproduce the issue
Configure ssh agent (all right)
Install the new docker-compose, following this https://github.com/docker/compose/releases
Install paramiko, following this https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko
Run docker-compose with -H parameter
Observed result
With the commands:
DOCKER_HOST='ssh://user@server' docker-compose up
and
docker-compose -H 'ssh://user@server' up
docker-compose needs paramiko dependency even when installed.
Docker runs fine:
docker -H ssh://user@server ps
Expected result
A success connection through ssh to a remote server.
Stacktrace / full error message
$ docker-compose -H 'ssh://user@server' up
