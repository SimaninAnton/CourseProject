Description of the issue
After making a change to a service, any services marked as dependent (via depends_on) are recreated upon running docker-compose up
My understanding was that unless the --always-recreate-deps flag was used with docker-compose up, dependent containers should not be recreated.
This behaviour seems to be very similar to this old issue #3397 which was deemed to indeed be a bug and dependent containers should not always be restarted. I've had a look at the fix #5541 which was merged in for this and think the issue is caused simply by an extraneous not on this line.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Given the following example composition
version: '3.7'
services:
  nginx1:
    image: nginx:latest

  nginx2:
    image: nginx:latest
    depends_on:
    - nginx1
docker-compose up -d
change nginx1's image tag e.g.alpine
docker-compose up -d
Observed result
nginx1 is recreated as expected
nginx2 container is also recreated, despite having not been updated
docker-compose up -d
Recreating miscellany_nginx1_1 ... done
Recreating miscellany_nginx2_1 ... done
Expected result
nginx1 is recreated as expected only.
nginx2 container remains running
docker-compose up -d
Recreating miscellany_nginx1_1 ... done
miscellany_nginx2_1 is up-to-date
