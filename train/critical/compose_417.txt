Description of the issue
This is my first inquiry/issue, so if I did something wrong in the formatting I apologize. Just let me know and I'll resolve it.
I'm noticing a seemingly peculiar issue when using docker-compose for our containers on Centos 7.4.1708. Shortly after the container(s) come up, the DNS works for roughly a minute; after about a minute or so, DNS is no longer able to resolve any domains at all. Further, on Ubuntu 14.04, the containers seem to maintain DNS just fine. I am assuming it's related to some config on Centos, but I'm not too sure yet.
At first, I noticed this spinning up a number of images in a single compose file, but after removing all contents, I noticed it happens with as little as one bare bones container, so it doesn't seem to be related to the combination of the containers.
I apologize for stripping some context out of the repo, but it's primarily internal. We noticed this error occurs with any image, though.

Steps to reproduce the issue
docker-compose up -f [compose_file]
Immediately after the lone container is up, do docker-compose exec zookeeper /bin/bash
ping google.com (for us, it's primarily internal DNS, but I noticed it happens for external as well)
Wait about 1-2 minutes
Retry. Eventually, it will fail.
Observed result
bash-4.2$ ping google.com
ping: google.com: Name or service not known
Expected result
Successful DNS connection via embedded docker DNS routing.
