Error message when trying to create a dynamic network name in a Compose file.
Describe the solution you'd like
I am trying to create isolated networks for my CI builds and am trying to build them based on a dynamically built network name from an environment variable.
Additional context
Currently, the Compose file does not correctly expand variables defined in a network name.
In the Compose file, I have defined the network as:
networks:
  ${NET}:
    external: true
Running docker-compose config does not show any errors. Here’s the abbreviated output of that command:
networks:
  $${NET}:
    external: true
    name: $${NET}
  postgresql:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ''
      POSTGRES_USER: test
    image: postgres:11.3
    networks:
      app_network_1: null
version: '3.7'
So, it shows the network being read from the environment variable. And I can see that network when I docker network ls, but Compose complains and fails to start the services:
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-ci.yml up -d
WARNING: Some networks were defined but are not used by any service: ${NET}
ERROR: Service "app" uses an undefined network "app_network_1"
Theoretically, it should work. Is something either missing or not happening correctly here?
