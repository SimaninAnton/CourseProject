Hey
i docker-compose, i am trying to use extend-fields to centralise a bunch of my configs.
e.g:
version: '3.4'
x-common-hosts: &common-hosts
  - "varnish.krn.xxx.at:${KRN_HOST_VHIST}"
  

services:
 xx:
   extra_hosts: *common-hosts
but i have like a ton of yml's and they all share the same common-hosts
i tried doing it like this.
`docker-compose -f global_settings.yml docker-compose.yml
where as:
global-settings.yml
version: '3.4'
x-common-hosts: &common-hosts
  - "varnish.krn.xxx.at:${KRN_HOST_VHIST}"
  
and docker-compose.yml
services:
 xx:
   extra_hosts: *common-hosts
fails with undefined common-hosts
docker-compose version: 1.22
thx
