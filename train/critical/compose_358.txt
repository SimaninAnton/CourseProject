Description of the issue
When specifying my username in the user: field of a service in a docker compose config file, the user is not recognized and compose fails with the error
ERROR: for api-server  Cannot start service api-server: linux spec user: unable to find user [my_username]: no matching entries in passwd file
However, when I use docker run, it works just fine when I specify my username, and files created by the container are owned by myself:
docker run -u [my_username] ...rest
For compose to work as expected, I must actually type in my user UID, 1000 in my case, in the config file:
user: 1000

Steps to reproduce the issue
Run docker compose with a config file containing user: [my_username] for a service, where my_username exists on the host.
Observed result
Error, username is not recognized
Expected result
Should work as docker run -u [my_username] does, and find the username on the host system.
