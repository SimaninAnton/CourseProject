Description of the issue
I am using below config in docker-compose . Just want to understand if it is safe to use SYS_ADMIN and /dev/fuse . I need it for running few applications which are only working on SYS_ADMIN , /dev/fuse.
Is there any risk to the host Linux VM ? Can someone inside Docker container attack or modify host VM /dev/fuse or other file systems ? What type of risk is there if I am using SYS_ADMIN and /dev/fuse
- SYS_ADMIN
devices:
- "/dev/fuse"
