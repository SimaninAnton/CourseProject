Description of the issue
Dockerfile is now using python:3.6 as base image and Dockerfile.armhf still uses Debian as base image. Also, armhf version tries to build python what is not necessary since python official image has official support for ARM architecture.
Context information (for bug reports)
Not applicable
Steps to reproduce the issue
Just check Dockerfile and Dockerfile.armhf
Check python:3.6 official image for ARM support
Observed result
Outdated Dockerfile.armhf that may lead to different results from regular Dockerfile.
Expected result
ARM and X86 (and hopefully other archs) shall produce similar (if not identical) results.
