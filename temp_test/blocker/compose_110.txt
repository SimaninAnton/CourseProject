Description of the issue
When running docker-compose up after updating docker in my macOS I got the following error message:
ERROR: Service 'the-name-of-the-service' failed to build: manifest for 'private.repo' not found: manifest unknown: The named manifest is not known to the registry.
This was perfectly working before updating the docker version. Also docker pull works perfectly with the image that docker-compose can't find, so it's not an auth issue.
