Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Related to #4799
What I discovered was if I defined and set up a server to only connect to internal only networks the ports that I specified to expose are not exposed.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to see a warning that when the service will not be exposed because all their networks are internal.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Crying and swearing at docker-compose
Additional context
The service '%s' will not have any ports exposed as it is only associated with networks that are internal only.
