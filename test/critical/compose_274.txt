I am running a Flask app succesfully in a docker container, but when i try to disable auto reloading (while trying to fix/troubleshoot signal only works in main thread error), i get this error after starting.
redis_1  | 1:M 25 Feb 2019 14:27:57.797 * Ready to accept connections
urllib3.connectionpool._make_request: http://localhost:None "POST /v1.30/containers/xxx/wait HTTP/1.1" 200 None
compose.cli.verbose_proxy.proxy_callable: docker wait -> {'Error': None, 'StatusCode': 1}
api_flask_1 exited with code 1
after changing this variable in docker-compose.yml
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=docker
      - FLASK_APP=api/app.py
      - FLASK_DEBUG=0
perhaps it has something to do with environment variable ?
setting it back to FLASK_DEBUG=1 fixes the issue and app loads as expected.
