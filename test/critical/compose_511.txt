Description of the issue
The docker-compose documentation at https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#secrets-configuration-reference implies that external secrets are usable by services created using docker-compose. However, when I try and create a service that uses an external secret, I receive a warning message
WARNING: Service "<service>" uses secret "<secret_name>" which is external. External secrets are not available to containers created by docker-compose.
Context information (for bug reports)
I am using secrets to make an ssh key available to a container at runtime.
