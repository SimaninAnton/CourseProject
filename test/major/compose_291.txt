Description of the issue
I recently upgraded Compose to 1.24.0-rc1 (build 0f3d4dda) and now Compose's automatic parsing of my .env file fails. I keep export statements in my .env file so I can easily source it in addition to using it as a standard .env. In previous versions of Compose, this worked fine and didn't give me any issues, however with this new update I instead get an error about spaces inside a value.
