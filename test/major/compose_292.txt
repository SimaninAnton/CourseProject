This project has 2 services: first and second.
second depends_on first. Then, at termination, first is stopped after second.
first has stop_grace_period: 20s configuration, then, it is expected to take at most 20 seconds to terminate first.
(While each command looks complicated, it works just as a debug message printer and does nothing but waits for termination)
Steps to reproduce the issue
Execute docker-compose up
Execute docker-compose stop in another shell.
See the output of the first shell.
Observed result
second_1  | SIGTERM received
second_1  | 0
second_1  | 1
second_1  | 2
second_1  | 3
second_1  | 4
second_1  | 5
second_1  | 6
second_1  | 7
second_1  | 8
second_1  | 9
second_1  | 10
docker-compose-bug-mock_second_1 exited with code 137
first_1   | SIGTERM received
first_1   | 0
first_1   | 1
first_1   | 2
first_1   | 3
first_1   | 4
first_1   | 5
first_1   | 6
first_1   | 7
first_1   | 8
first_1   | 9
docker-compose-bug-mock_first_1 exited with code 137
Expected result
first service should be killed after 20 seconds after it receives SIGTERM (docker stop) while it actually is killed in 10 seconds.
