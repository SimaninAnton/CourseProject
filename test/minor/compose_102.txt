I have a problem similar to that described in issue #2033 (multiple commands for a compose service), with the difference that the first command to be executed is a "source"
Assuming to have the script script.sh where the command alias myAlias is defined, the following (solution proposed in issue #2033 )
command: bash -c "source script.sh && myAlias"
generates the following error
bash: myAlias: command not found
