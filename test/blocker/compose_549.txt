Description of the issue
When running docker-compose up tester & this command still listens to CTRL+C in subsequent programs (eg. less).
The same applies to docker-compose logs -f tester | less -R +F (-R for colors, +F for follow). When I hit CTRL+C in the less to stop following the input and do some searching, the logs command aborts and stops giving the less new data.
I am reading the logs using this approach because there is no way to show only logs after the boot time. But even when the #2227 (-since=boot option I am desperately waiting for) will be implemented, the less could not be used to easy navigate the logs due to this bug.

Output of "docker-compose config"
$ docker-compose config
services:
  tester:
    command: ping localhost

version: '3.0'
Steps to reproduce the issue
create the docker-compose.yml file with content defined above
create simple start-up shell script test.sh
#!/bin/bash

docker-compose up tester 2>&1 >> "temp.log" &
less -R +F "temp.log"
run the script test.sh, in window A
see the expected pinging and the following feature of less command
in another window, B, run command tail -f temp.log
see the expected pinging and the following feature of tail -f command
back to window A, hit CTRL+C to stop following, allows to navigate the log using arrow keys (less features)
hit SHIFT+F to continue following
Observed result
The service was stopped (window B shows no more pinging). It somehow catched the signal.
Expected result
The service continue to work independently on the actions done in less command.
Additional information
The docker-compose logs command has same bug:
run docker-compose logs -f tester | less -R +F
hit CTRL+C to stop following, allows to navigate the log using arrow keys
hit SHIFT+F to continue following
the docker-compose logs command ended giving no data from now on
