I've tried installing docker-compose and I've tried copying the binary, both render the same result:
/bin/sh: docker-compose: not found
Here's the Dockerfile I'm using:
FROM python:3.7.4-alpine3.9
COPY --from=docker/compose:1.24.1 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
CMD ["sh"]
It's there (good permissions and size):
/ # ls -la /usr/local/bin | grep docker-compose
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      16168192 Jun 24 10:12 docker-compose
But when I try to run it:
/ # docker-compose
/bin/sh: docker-compose: not found
Not even from /usr/local/bin:
/usr/local/bin # docker-compose
/bin/sh: docker-compose: not found
What am I doing wrong?
