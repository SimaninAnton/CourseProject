Steps to reproduce the issue
The issue can be observed when docker-compose up is executed against external Docker API exposed by VSphere Integrated Containers (VIC) environment. VIC default bridge network has no labels dict. Output of docker network inspect bridge:

    "Driver": "",

            "Gateway": "172.16.0.1"
        }
    ]
},
