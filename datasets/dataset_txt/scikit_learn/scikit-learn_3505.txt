We should probably fix this. this means set_params was broken.
I think an easy fix that doesn't break backward compatibility would be:
introduce a property _alpha = alpha / n_components and then use _alpha instead of alpha everywhere.
That would mean behavior stays the same for people not using set_params / clone.
