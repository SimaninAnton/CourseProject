Howdy,
Just wanted to offer a heads up... I was having an awful go of compiling from source on my machine until I eventually figured out the new Xcode deletes the PPC assembler from the system [link]. This ended up being an issue though as Python was still trying to support three architectures, and since the makefile couldn't find one, it was throwing a broken pipe error.
In the meantime, I found that setting the architecture flags in-line resolved it (even though I have this defined in my bash profile)...
sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" pip install ...
I was particularly confused, because I had an older version and couldn't figure out why the update was failing. Hope this proves helpful in the dev process. For completeness, I'm running OS X 10.6.8, Xcode 4.2.
Thanks for all the hard work!
