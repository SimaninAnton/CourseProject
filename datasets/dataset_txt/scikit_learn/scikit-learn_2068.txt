Description
I run Ridge regression with two methods:
Using RidgeCV
Using KFold to prepare folds for CV and then use Ridge for each fold
The optional alpha selected from the two methods are very different.

Expected Results
The best alphas from the two methods should be close.
Actual Results
They are very different.
