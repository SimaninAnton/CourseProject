I think it would be useful to have meta-estimators for turning a classifier or a regressor into a multi-output classifier or regressor. It's a recurrent pattern and I find myself reimplementing it every once in a while.
This is of course useful for estimators that don't have native multi-output support but even for those that have like RF, I find that estimating a model independently for each output sometimes works better.
Class names: MultiOutputClassifier and MultiOutputRegressor
