In OPTICS, we calculate self.n_clusters_ in fit (self.n_clusters_ = np.max(self.labels_)). This attribute is not used later and it's not documented as a public attribute. Should we document it or remove it? (I prefer to remove it since it does not seems useful and might introduce confusion since we have outliers.)
Also, seems that it should be self.n_clusters_ = np.max(self.labels_) + 1 since index starts at 0?
