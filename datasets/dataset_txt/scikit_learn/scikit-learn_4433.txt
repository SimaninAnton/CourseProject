Hi All,
I try to do ward clustering using this data set: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68126956/df.csv, which has 52674 raw and 49 columns.
And sklearn will throw a MemoryError:
MemoryError: out of memory while computing linkage
But when I use the R to do the samething, R will complete this job, although the distance matrix will use more the 10G memory.
Is there something I can do will the such large data?
