In the 1988 Jacob's implementation, the learning rate is adaptive. Is it possible to add this into t-sne?
"The learning rate η is initially set to 100 and it is updated after every iteration by means of the adaptive learning rate scheme described by Jacobs (1988)." http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/tsne.pdf
Inspired by this discussion:

Adaptive learning rate option exists in sklearn:
