Add an estimator that scales each feature into a given range i.e. [0,1].
This is easily done by using the min and max on the training set.
The estimator must remember the scaling so it can be applied to the test set.
Also, rename Scaler to UnitVarianceScaler.
The class Scaler should be deprecated and keep for compatibility.
