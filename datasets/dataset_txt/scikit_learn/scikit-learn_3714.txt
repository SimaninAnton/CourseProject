As you have observed, sourceforge.net is not a very reliable host. Furthermore it would be simpler to update the documentation if we used the github.io / github pages system.
There are some limitations though:
it's apparently not possible to setup HTTP 301 / 302 redirects for instance from / to /stable for the home page.
I am not sure github.io will allow us enough space to host all the old versions of the website (would need to check the size limits and measure the size of the total folder on sourceforge).
For the first issue, I have made some tests with HTML meta refresh to implement a redirection at the HTML level.
See:
https://github.com/ogrisel/test-gh-pages/blob/gh-pages/index.html
and the result:
http://ogrisel.github.io/test-gh-pages/
This causes some flickering but I think it's ok. What do other people think?
