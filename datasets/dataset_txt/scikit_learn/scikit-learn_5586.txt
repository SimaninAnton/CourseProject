make test is a convenient way to run tests on UNIX platforms.
@glouppe found that, contrary to python -c "import scikits.learn as skl; skl.test()", make test doesn't cach doctest failures, for example those which are missing imports.
I tried different options in the nosetests command but couldn't reproduce the behaviour of the test() function in scikits/learn/__init__.py, so my suggestion is to use python -c "import scikits.learn as skl; skl.test()" as the test task in the Makefile. Any thoughts?
@glouppe is planning to work on it this evening (european time)
I gotta go so don't wait for my comments.
