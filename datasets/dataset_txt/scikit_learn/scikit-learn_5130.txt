The CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer classes possibly leave behind open file descriptors in decode. When the input type is filename the decode method opens the filenames in an iterable for reading but never closes them. This leads to unpredictable behaviour as it is not clear when the file pointers are closed.
Should use with instead.
I have a fix for this, in my fork of the repo, and I've created a pull request from the fixed branch.
