Hi,
I think there is a bug in predict_proba method of the base.py class (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/mixture/base.py). Lines 393-394 currently read:
_, log_resp = self._estimate_log_prob_resp(X)
return np.exp(log_resp)
Probably they should be
log_prob, _ = self._estimate_log_prob_resp(X)
return np.exp(log_prob)
