Since RandomizedPCA will drop sparse matrix support in 0.16, it would be useful to have explained_variance_ratio_ available in TruncatedSVD. @ogrisel mentioned that this could probably be implemented in the same way as RandomizedPCA. I noticed that #2664 recently fixed this calculation in RandomizedPCA.
