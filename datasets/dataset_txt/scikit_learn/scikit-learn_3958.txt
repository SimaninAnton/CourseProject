Accepts <key,value> pairs where value is of type string. Does not work in scenarios where value is of type int, representing categories such as 1, 2, 3, ...6.
It isn't specified in the documentation that value should be of type string. Either this should be changed, or functionality of dictvectorizer should be modified to accept categorical values of a numeric data type.
