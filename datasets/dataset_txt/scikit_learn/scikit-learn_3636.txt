This is not a bug, but I wonder whether there is a way to get around this..
I have a numpy X matrix with size (1455715, 2048). The numpy matrix X is in boolean, so it can fit into the memory of a 16G machine. I used MiniBatchKmean for the clustering, but it seems to do some conversion or create a variable in check_array() function. Is there any way to avoid this error? Or, I should switch to a machine with 160G memory.
