The GP prediction in the GP vs. KRR example in the doc looks quite bad currently. It should actually have a longer length-scale and look similar to KRR.
When running the example on my local machine, the prediction looks ok (similar to KRR, see below). I believe this is an issue resulting from limited numerical precision and that it could be resolved by either choosing a larger alpha in GaussianProcessRegressor or by setting length_scale_bounds for the ExpSineSquared. But since I cannot reproduce the issue locally, it's hard to tell. Can anyone reproduce the issue?
This is how the example should look like:
