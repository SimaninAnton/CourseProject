Peculiar omission in ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS list in stop_words.py:
The list includes "one", "two", "three"...all the way up to "twelve", but with the exclusion of "seven".
I wasn't able to find any reason for this omission from the origin of the list (http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words).
Should "seven" be included for uniformity, or is there an underlying reason for this exclusion?
