Hello
I'm looking at the documentation for sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering
With my default window size, one of the allowed values for the option affinity is "pre-computed". However, this is invalid when I attempt to use it. Also, if I shrink the window size of my browser, this option becomes "precomputed", which does work. I observed this in both Chrome and Safari browsers.
It might be worth considering turning off the formatting that inserts these dashes, especially in text of the API. Screenshots attached.
