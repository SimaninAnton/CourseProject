As discussed on the mailing list, I think we should have a backport of the context manager and msg argument in assert_raises and assert_raises_regex as they were introduced in Python3.3:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises
Then we can make that the asserts in check_estimator have reasonable messages.
