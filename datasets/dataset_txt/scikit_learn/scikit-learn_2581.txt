Description
As a user (and developer of downstream libraries) I've occasionally had to use sklearn.pipeline._name_estimators to get at the names assigned by make_pipeline. Would you be open to making it part of the public API? I don't have any publicly-accessible examples at the moment, but I can provide some use-cases if needed.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Example:
In [2]: from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

In [3]: from sklearn.pipeline import _name_estimators

In [4]: _name_estimators([LinearRegression()])
Out[4]:
[('linearregression',
  LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=1, normalize=False))]
If you're OK with making it part of the API, I'll hopefully be able to submit a PR in the next couple weeks (along with tests ðŸ˜‰ ).
