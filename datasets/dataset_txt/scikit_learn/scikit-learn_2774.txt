First of all the master build is broken because sklearn.feature_selection.tests.test_from_model.test_feature_importances found a mismatch.
Despite that problem, I've notice that the 4th build option of Travis is not detecting the problem. When I see the log in detail, it seems that it is doing nothing.
I remember that this 4th job was dedicated to the mac computation but now it's a linux for python 2.7
Maybe I didn't notice the change. Anyway, this is a problem that the 4th job is always happy.
