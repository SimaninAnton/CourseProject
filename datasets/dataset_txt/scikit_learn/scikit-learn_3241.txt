In hierarchical.py,
documentation of parameter children in function _hc_cut is different from itself in other functions.
In function _hc_cut,
children : list of pairs. Length of n_nodes
    The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than `n_samples` refer
    to leaves of the tree. A greater value `i` indicates a node with
    children `children[i - n_samples]`.
In other functions,
children_ : array-like, shape (n_nodes-1, 2)
    The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than `n_samples`
    correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples.
    A node `i` greater than or equal to `n_samples` is a non-leaf
    node and has children `children_[i - n_samples]`. Alternatively
    at the i-th iteration, children[i][0] and children[i][1]
    are merged to form node `n_samples + i`
If this need to be modified, may I send a PR?
