The website is sometimes very slow and I think we should try improve that.
For instance, we could use JPEG images instead of PNG, which could easily reduce loading times by 50 to 75%.
Some images are unnecessarily too big. In particular, those in the carousel in the index page are gigantic and take several seconds to load.
