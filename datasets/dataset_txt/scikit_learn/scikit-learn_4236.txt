This is a clarification of the issues in #3616. In some cases, notably where feature Series are a mix of boolean and non-boolean, Pandas will produce numeric data with dtype=object. The handling of such data is currently untested in scikit-learn and results in quirks. It should either result in specific error messages or be accepted and handled correctly.
#3616 raises two issues:
LinearModel.decision_function (and predict for regressors) will output dtype=object for similar input (despite the precision of the output being limited by coef_ anyway)
regression metrics may break with cryptic errors given dtype=object input
