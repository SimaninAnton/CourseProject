Hi, I'm trying to use fit_params (for sample_weight on GradientBoostingClassifier as an algorithm for VotingClassifier) for RandomizedSearch with VotingClassifier since the dataset is unbalanced. Could someone give me advice on this (possibly with code sample)? Or would it be even possible?
My current-not-working code is below:
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(my_votingClassifier, param_distributions=param_dist,
                                   n_iter=n_iter_search, n_jobs=-1, fit_params={'sample_weight':y_np_array})
Error:
TypeError: fit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sample_weight'
Thanks!
