Presentlyu, SparsePCA used dict_learning or dict_learning_online on X.T, and sets its components_ to be the outputted code of these functions (which is sparse).
Though it is a simple way to reuse code from dict_learning.py, it has for drawback that it does not allow the user to learn in the sample direction, which prevents the use of partial_fit and is not adapted in a setting where data is streamed.
A solution for this would be to use another formulation for sparse PCA, found in [1] which enforces an elastic net constraint for D, and thus implies projecting D on the elastic net ball instead of the L2 ball as it is done today.
Efficient projection algorithms exists, as described in [1], [2].
