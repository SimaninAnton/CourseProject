Following #3945, is that possible that tied covariance could also have the possibility of being non positive definite? @amueller
def _covar_mstep_tied(gmm, X, responsibilities, weighted_X_sum, norm,
                      min_covar):
    # Eq. 15 from K. Murphy, "Fitting a Conditional Linear Gaussian
    # Distribution"
    avg_X2 = np.dot(X.T, X)
    avg_means2 = np.dot(gmm.means_.T, weighted_X_sum)
    out = avg_X2 - avg_means2
    out *= 1. / X.shape[0]
    out.flat[::len(out) + 1] += min_covar
    return out
