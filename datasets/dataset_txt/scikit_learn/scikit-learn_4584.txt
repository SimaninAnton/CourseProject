Hi, I had a question about how I can use gaussianHMM to train on several different observation sequences.
The example here :http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_hmm_stock_analysis.html#example-applications-plot-hmm-stock-analysis-py
Shows EM converging on 1 long observation sequence. But in many scenarios, we want to break up the observations (like training on set of sentences) with each observation sequence having a START and END state. That is, I would like to globally train on multiple observation sequences.
How can one accomplish this when using GuassianHMM? Is there a example to look at?
Thanks in advance
