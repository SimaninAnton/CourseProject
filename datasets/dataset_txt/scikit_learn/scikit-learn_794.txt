We keep getting questions and issues which relate to the randomness of tree based (#12979 and some conversations on gitter for instance).
It'd be nice to have a nice explanation somewhere, explaining the source of randomness in these models.
For the prospective contributor: this may involve having to check out sklearn/tree/tree.py and sklearn/tree/*.pyx files.
