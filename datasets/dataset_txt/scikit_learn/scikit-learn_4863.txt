Docs state that max_features can be a float, in which case it's treated as a percentage of n_features to use when constructing trees. However, anything less than 1.0 just yields trees with a single node.
I am assuming "percentage" means the parameter should vary in the interval (0.0, 1.0], not in the interval (0.0, 100.0].
Passing an integer that is less than or equal to n_features seems to work fine.
