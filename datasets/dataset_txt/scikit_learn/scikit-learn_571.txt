I have some questions about the BIRCH implementation, more espiecially about the differences between the paper and the implementation:
The paper is making reference of a step of meging refinement in the insertion algorithm, this step does not seem to be implemented in the source code, am i right ?
The paper is also making references to a conditionnal Phase 2 which consist of condensing the tree, is it implemented currently ?
In the paper, the branching factor is defined by two attributes B and L, but only one in the implementation, why ?
