Description
HTML issue on Pipelines documentation page makes examples unreadable
There seems to be an issue with the Pipeline and FeatureUnion: combining estimators page at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html. All other pages (so far) are rendering correctly. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post the issue-
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Accessing http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html Chrome Version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73)
This documentation is for scikit-learn version 0.18.2
Expected Results
I expect the examples to look like all the other pages
Actual Results
some example cells are tightly left aligned
