examples/applications/plot_stock_market.py is currently failing to run because Google no longer considers some stock tickers to be valid aliases.
https://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q=SAP&output=csv used to work, but now you need https://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q=NYSE:SAP&output=csv
https://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q=CAT&output=csv used to work, but now you need https://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q=NYSE:CAT&output=csv
etc.
plot_stock_market.py includes a mapping:
    ...
    'KMB': 'Kimberly-Clark',
    'R': 'Ryder',
    'GD': 'General Dynamics',
    'RTN': 'Raytheon',
    'CVS': 'CVS',
    'CAT': 'Caterpillar',
    'DD': 'DuPont de Nemours'}
The contributor fixing this issue should use Wikipedia or Wikidata to map the company names to an updated / appropriately prefixed ticker label. I think we should ideally prefix the NASDAQ etc tickers too to be a bit more future-proof (AAPL -> NASDAQ:AAPL), but at a minimum we need to fix any that currently fail.
