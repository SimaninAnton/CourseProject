Since 83f67ee, GridSearchCV has decision_function and friends, but only after fitting. I just tried to tune each of the binary classifiers in an OvR constructor separately:
OneVsRestClassifier(GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(), parameters,
                                 cv=KFold(len(Y_train), 5)))
... but this doesn't work; it fails with
ValueError: The base estimator should implement decision_function or predict_proba!
because these methods are only available after fit has been called.
(Actually, the same is true of predict and transform. It's as if the type of a GridSearchCV changes after some of its methods have been called.)
