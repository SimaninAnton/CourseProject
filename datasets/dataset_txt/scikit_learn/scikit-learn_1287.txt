Description
When using the sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.fit(), I set the sample_weight to my own set of weights to focus on specific instances. Weights are selected to be an Y_fit^n, where n is an integer value. I want the model to focus on predicting the high Y values more accurately. Regardless of the weighting values used, it does not seem to change the output results. Using the same sample_weight vector with sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.fit(), works as expected. Has anyone experienced this issue before?
