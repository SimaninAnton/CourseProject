I use a browser plugin that disables most cross-site extensions that can track you. On the scikit-learn website it finds google analytics and google ajax search api. I believe the latter being disabled causes the header to be less tall than it should be and the body to shift a bit.
I'm tagging this as Enhancement because if you install such blockers you basically "void your warranty" and shouldn't expect greatness.
