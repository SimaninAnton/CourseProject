Hi.
I am working on a Multi-label text classification problem. In order to encode the labels, I am using MultiLabelBinarizer. The labels of the dataset look like -
When I am using
mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()
mlb.fit(labels)
print(mlb.classes_)
I am getting -
Whereas, the output (sample output) I want is -
I got the above output by -
mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()
sample_labels = [
    ['stat.ML', 'cs.LG'],
    ['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']
]
mlb.fit(sample_labels)
print(mlb.classes_)
Help would be very much appreciated here.
Here's the dataset I had prepared:
arXivdata.csv.zip
I stripped away the double quotes in the labels after loading it in a pandas DataFrame by -
import re 

arxiv_data['labels'] = arxiv_data['labels'].str.replace(r"[\"]", '')
scikit-learn version: '0.21.3'
