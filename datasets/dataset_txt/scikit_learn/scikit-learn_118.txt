Hello, I was going though the sag implementation, and I found that the loss variable is a string, while the sag function itself expects a function, and I was not sure if this was correct. I did not run into any errors when I ran it, but was not sure why.
Also the function call seems to pass more parameters than the sag function expects with *args in the function.
