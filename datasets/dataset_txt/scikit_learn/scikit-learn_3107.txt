I downloaded the repository to change something in documentation.
I tried to build the html:
make html-noplot
But at the beginning it says:
Failed to import 'sklearn.model_selection': no module named sklearn.model_selection
Failed to import 'sklearn.exceptions': no module named sklearn.exceptions
Failed to import 'sklearn.multioutput': no module named sklearn.multioutput
As far as I want to work with cross_val_score doc page I can't solve the issue #6542
WARNING: [autosummary] failed to import u'sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score': no module named sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score
So as a result some html appeared, but not all of them (including cross_val_score)
All packages are up-to-date. OS X. Python 2.
