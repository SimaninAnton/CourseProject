I was trying silhouette_score on 23K data sample. I didn't know about memory requirements for computing distance matrix, so my 4GB laptop freeze.
It seems this does not happen on 32bit Python version, as then Python just crashes: biolab/orange3#1502 which is more preferable then freezing the system.
