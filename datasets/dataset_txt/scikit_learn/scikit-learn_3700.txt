In sklearn.base there are the functions
is_classifier(estimator)
is_regressor(estimator)
They both check getattr(estimator, "_estimator_type", None) == <type>. The attribute _estimator_type is defined for ClassifierMixin, RegressorMixin, ClusterMixin but not for BiclusterMixin, TransformerMixin.
Another method that is used very often is issubclass(Estimator, <Type>Mixin) which is possible for all types of estimators.
What is the preferred way to check the type of an optimizer?
