I am not familiar with the generalized cross validation but something seems to be missing here:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/linear_model.html#using-cross-validation
the lower plot looks a bit empty.
Also, the attribute alpha of LassoCV is not documented and I guess it should end with an underscore if I understand it correctly.
