In the merged PR, the CategoricalEncoder was put in the preprocessing module. However, it might make more sense to put it in feature_extraction since it is dealing with extracting numerical features from categorical data (eg also DictVectorizer is in that module).
I think the main reason it is in preprocessing is because OneHotEncoder is historically there.
But since it's not yet released we can still change this, if we would want to.
