Hello everyone, we are ApacheCN, an open-source community in China, focusing on Big Data and AI.
Recently, we have been working on translating sklearn documents.
sklearn: https://sklearn.apachecn.org
There are several reasons:
The English level of many Chinese users is not very good.
Network problems, you know (China's magic network)!
Online blogs are very messy.
We are very willing to do some Chinese localization for your project. If possible, please give us some authorization.
