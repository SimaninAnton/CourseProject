Right now we are using inspect in some common tests (utils.estimator_checks) to get method arguments. But that doesn't work if the method is decorated, for example with a deprecation.
In that case we need to use utils.testing._get_args. So we need to make sure to use that whenever we inspect arguments.
A good test would be to create a model that has all methods deprecated and see if the tests still pass.
We should also check whether the sample_weights are detected correctly.
