original ticket description is below:
ABCMeta is not applied in Python 3.x
This cause test failures in sklearn/tests/test_common.py.
The fix is not clear for me: six.with_metaclass always caused headaches (I can't make it work e.g. for naive_bayes.BaseNB), and juggling with manual type creation is quite ugly.
