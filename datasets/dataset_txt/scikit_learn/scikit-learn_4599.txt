I'd like to use scikit-learn as my experimentation / dev tool for building svm classifiers, but then use libsvm in production. I can import a classifier into libsvm by loading a valid model file, produced by libsvm.svm_save_model("my_model", model).
Would it be possible to expose the libsvm model object via scikit-learn? I see it instantiated here.
