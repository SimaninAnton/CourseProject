fetch_lfw_people returns faces in different orders depending on the file system being used. In the case of the "Faces recognition example using eigenfaces and SVMs" demo, this means that different faces will be in training and test depending on the system running the demo. This will give different users much different results.
The following line is from _fetch_lfw_people in scikit-learn/sklearn/datasets/lfw.py on L199
paths = [join(folder_path, f) for f in listdir(folder_path)]
This needs to be changed to
paths = [join(folder_path, f) for f in sorted(listdir(folder_path))]
Notice that according to
https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html
listdir is described as: "Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path. The list is in arbitrary order."
This arbitrary ordering is what causes the demo to be inconsistent.
This bug is easy to fix.
