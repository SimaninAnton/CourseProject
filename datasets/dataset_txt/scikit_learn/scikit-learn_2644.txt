This code:
testText = "science space prediction fiction"
testTfidfs = tfidfer.transform(testText)
Will return just zero matrix.
The right code is:
testText = ["science space prediction fiction"]
testTfidfs = tfidfer.transform(testText)
I think it's hard for newbies to notice this kind of error. I'm new in machine learning, but if it's possible (I mean if there's no any other use cases of both alternative) - could you please raise an Exception when just String is given for a function?
