Given that building various images in the user guide requires one to download various large datasets, would it be possible to distribute a tarball containing a prebuilt copy of the docs (e.g., in html)? This would be helpful for scikit learn package maintainers for various distributions because it would obviate the need to include large datasets in the source packages in order to build the docs properly.
