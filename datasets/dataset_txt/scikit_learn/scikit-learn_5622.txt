liblinear and libsvm default tolerance parameters are fine tuned for standardized data
by upstream authors and give a good compromise between accuracy and
convergence speed.
mblondel suggests having an objective
function dependent default values for tol.
We could set tol to None and use a dictionary to set the default value.
