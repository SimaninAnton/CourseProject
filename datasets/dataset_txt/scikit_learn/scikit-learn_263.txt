Description
Documentation: Size of intercept_ in LDA should be (n_classes)
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1495f6924/sklearn/discriminant_analysis.py#L189
In a mutliclass LDA classification the size of
Weights (coeff) are n_classes x n_features
Intercept is n_classes
In documentation for intercept it is given as shape (n_features,) which I thing is wrong.
