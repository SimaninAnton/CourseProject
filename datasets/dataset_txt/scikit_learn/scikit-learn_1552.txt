Our developer guidelines recommend using autopep8 and running it on whole files, which results in contributors changing things against our conventions (e.g. blank lines after docstrings), and modifying parts of files unrelated to their work. Unless we want to just autopep8 the whole repo and deal with merge conflicts, I think we should consider removing this recommendation. What do others think?
