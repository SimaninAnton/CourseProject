Section 3.1.3. A note on shuffling in modules/cross_validation.html seems misleading.
It suggests that if the samples are ordered by time, then shuffling the data will lead to overfitting. Surely if we know there is a bias in the data order, the data should be shuffled to remove that bias, so that each fold aims to have a random IID split. Otherwise each iteration of the cross validation will be using training sets of a consistently different time to the test set.
