Description
There is 'means_prior_' in bayesian_mixture.py Attributes.
269    means_prior_ : array-like, shape (n_features,)
270        The prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian).
But, There is no other 'means_prior_' but there are 'mean_prior_'.
I think that this is correct.
269    mean_prior_ : array-like, shape (n_features,)
270        The prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian).
