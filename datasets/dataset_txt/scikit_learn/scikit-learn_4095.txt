For 1 dimensional data fit with a one component GMM, I would expect that the BIC scores of the 'tied' and other covariance types ('diag', 'spherical', 'full') should be the same (as is the case when the data is run through the R package Mclust (note Mclust actually plots -BIC):

however this is not the case, as can be seen from the following result generated with sklearn.mixture.gmm() on the same 1D data:

Note that the \DeltaBIC score is just a given model's BIC score minus the best model's BIC score. So for 1 component, both the 'tied' and 'diag' point should be on top of one another.
I have verified that the BIC difference (for the 1 component, 1D case) is only due to different results with self.score() results for 'tied' vs 'diag'. (i.e. not due to improper estimate of self._n_parameters())
Note that 'diag', 'spherical', and 'full' all produce the same BIC score for the 1 component, 1D case. It is only 'tied' that differs.
