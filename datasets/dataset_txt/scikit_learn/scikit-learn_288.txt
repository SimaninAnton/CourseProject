Right now some pxd-files are included into the installation, e.g. sklearn.tree._utils.pxd, but some not, e.g. from sklearn.neighbor.
It would be better to have a consistent policy concerning pxd-files. For example right now sklearn.tree._utils.pxd is available in the installation but of no use - it needs/cimports pxd-files from sklearn.neighbor which aren't there.
It could be benefitial to have all pxd-files copied to the installation, because then it would became possible to subclass/tweak Cython-cdef-classes, even if it means that some internal API gets exposed. Or at least copy only those pxd-files, which can really be used/cimported from the installation.
