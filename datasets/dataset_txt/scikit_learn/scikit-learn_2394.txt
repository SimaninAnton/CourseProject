From the implementation and name it looks like that's intended, but the current behavior of min_impurity_split seems odd to me and not what is usually used as stopping criterion in the literature.
In the literature, you do not do a split unless it decreases the impurity by a given threshold.
In scikit-learn, you do not do a split if the impurity of the current node is not above a given threshold.
Check out the example on breast_cancer here:
The left node has an impurity of 0.08, so it is not split any further - even though there is a very good split possible here that would decrease the gini a lot:
Basically even if another split could create entirely pure leaves, it's not considered because this leaf is considered "pure enough".
You can see that the tree above is very imbalanced and this imbalance is really arbitrary. I don't think this is a good stopping criterion, and I think we should implement the standard stopping criterion from the literature.
