The instructions on the scikit website ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html ) about installing scikit-learn on linux say the following:
Install the following dependencies using apt-get:
build-essential
python-dev
python-setuptools
python-numpy
python-scipy
libatlas-dev
libatlas3gf-base
Install scikit-learn using pip.
After I installed it following these steps, and tried to run some sklearn-code, it gave the following error:
RuntimeError: NumPy < 1.7.0 does not implement searchsorted on unicode data correctly. Please upgrade NumPy to use LabelEncoder with unicode inputs.
While on the install page it says:
Scikit-learn requires:
- NumPy (>= 1.6.1),
I found a solution for this: DON'T install numpy using apt-get, instead install numpy with pip:
pip install numpy==1.9.1
Maybe I can help some people with this.
