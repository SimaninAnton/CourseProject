(Saving this for the upcoming sprints, ideally)
Let's remove the use of assert_equal, assert_greater, and assert_greater_equal in our tests.
These should be changed to simply assert a == b, assert a > b or assert a >= b.
For contributors: pick one of the modules below, and please comment on this issue saying e.g. "I'm working on cluster/tests", to avoid other contributors choosing the same modules.
You can see all the occurrences of the entries that need to be removed with e.g. git grep "assert_equal" sklearn/ensemble/tests/.
