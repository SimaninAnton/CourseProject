I think the example code on the following page for "One-Class SVM" could be improved to get better prediction results.
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/covariance/plot_outlier_detection.html#example-covariance-plot-outlier-detection-py
Currently, the code trains the one-class svm on both normal instances and outliers via "clf.fit(X)";
However, a better model will be trained based on only normal instances, if we use:
if clf_name.find('One-Class')>=0: clf.fit(np.r_[X1, X2])
else: clf.fit(X)
