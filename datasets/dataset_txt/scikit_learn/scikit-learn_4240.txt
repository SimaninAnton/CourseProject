i'm running into a library issue. on osx, with anaconda and accelerate
the setup process works fine but then when i try to execute something it breaks here:
from ..pairwise import pairwise_distances
     11 
     12 

/software/anaconda/envs/devpype/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py in <module>()
     53 from ..externals.joblib.parallel import cpu_count
     54 
---> 55 from .pairwise_fast import _chi2_kernel_fast, _sparse_manhattan
     56 
     57 

ImportError: dlopen(/software/anaconda/envs/devpype/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/pairwise_fast.so, 2): Library not loaded: libmkl_intel_lp64.dylib
  Referenced from: /software/anaconda/envs/devpype/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/pairwise_fast.so
  Reason: image not found
is there a known workaround? i guess i can change the DYLD libraries, but didn't see this issue in search.
