I found that in order to train some large RF regressions using n_jobs = big is very helpful, BUT, the model appears to not be portable. I pickled it, reloaded it from the pickle, and was unable to use the predict() method, which gave me a key error from joblib. I think the threads are stored with the object in order to parallelize the prediction as well. Is it possible to initiate new threads if the old ones aren't available?
