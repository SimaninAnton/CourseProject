The instructions to build the documentation suggest,
For building the documentation, you will need sphinx, matplotlib and pillow.
yet numpydoc also appear to be a requirement (tested on master with Python 3.6 and sphinx 1.6.3),
make html                                                                                                     [doc-version] 
# These two lines make the build a bit more lengthy, and the

Running Sphinx v1.6.3

Extension error:

Extension error:

make: *** [Makefile:42: html] Error 1
If confirmed, numpydoc and sphinx-gallery requirements would need to be added to doc/developers/contributing.rst and doc/README.md.
Having e.g. a documentation_requrements.txt somewhere with all the requirements to build the docs (one per line) could also be handy? It could be used from build_tools/circle/build_doc.sh to install the requirements with pip or conda to avoid divergences between the documentation and the CI build in the future..
