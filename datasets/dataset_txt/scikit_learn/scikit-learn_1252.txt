I think we should have a document in the doc that describes our long and mid-term roadmap. That will help new contributors and possible donors help see the direction of the project. I think right now things are scattered through issues, PRs, Sleps, and the brains of several core devs. We should at least try to extract some common themes maybe, and possibly link to relevant issues.
Also maybe describe blockers for 1.0, though that's less important to me than providing general directions and "big issues".
Things that I think should be on the road map are categorical variable support, model evaluation support for unsupervised models, faster gradient boosting (maybe), using OpenMP and multi-level parallelization, a whole bunch of things around grid-search, maybe making pipeline etc respect the estimator API, subsampling in pipelines, possibly "routing".
We don't need to agree on everything, but just listing it would be good, I think - and maybe say what's consensus and what's not.
