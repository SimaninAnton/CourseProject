I always seem to get the same error when wanting to use univariate_selection.
univariate_selection.py:92: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide f = msb / msw
I am using python 2.7.3 64 bit version and numpy 1.6.2.
The train array I use has the shape (957L, 3317L). Which means there are currently 3317 features and I would like to select the 10% most useful ones using 'SelectPercentile'.
The arrays msb and msw are looking as follows:
msb : ndarray: [-0.01144492 -0.00071531 -0.00643777 ..., -0.00643777 -0.00643777
-0.00286123] with dtype: float64
msw: ndarray: [ 0.00574713 0.00143678 0.00431034 ..., 0.00431034 0.00431034\n 0.00287356] with dtype: float64
I was first running python in 32 bit-modus so I figured that would've been the problem, but after removing it and installing the 64 bit version and all 64 bit extention packages I am still experiencing the same problem.
