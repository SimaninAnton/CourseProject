KNeighborsClassifier (kNN, and other Nearest Neighbors learners) should implement predict_proba() method.
The predicted probability could be the ratio of neighbors voting for each label, for example, if n_neighbors=5 and 4 neighbors have class=1 and one has class=0, then predict_proba() for that example should return [0.2, 0.8].
This sounds simple. Is it feasible? :-)
