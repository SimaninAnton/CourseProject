I found this when trying to write tests for #14560.
Right now, StratifiedKFold might have the fold sizes unequal by n_classes:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

y = np.array([1, 1, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4,
       2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 4, 3, 1, 3, 5, 2, 1,
       1, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5,
       4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 5, 1, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4,
       4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1, 5, 5, 4])

[len(x[1]) for x in StratifiedKFold(n_splits=7).split(y, y)]
[15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 10]
We could achieve something like
[15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14]
but our rounding doesn't let us :-/
