I am using SVR for time-series data with input sample_weights and I would like to continue propagating those uncertainties through further manipulations of the data, so need a return from SVR (or .predict(), I suppose) of the same shape as sample_weight but that represents the uncertainty of the fitted points.
Thanks!
