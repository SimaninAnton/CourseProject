After I installed the package, I run the file "test_tree.py" under the directory "/scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/tests". Here is the message I got:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test_tree.py", line 39, in
from sklearn.tree.tree import SPARSE_SPLITTERS
ImportError: cannot import name SPARSE_SPLITTERS
I have no idea why this happens.
