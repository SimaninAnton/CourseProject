When doc/ and examples/ are the only things touched in a set of new commits, a pull request's Travis and AppVeyor builds need not run, except for the Travis flake8 job. Perhaps this kind of optimisation is worthwhile for sprints when there's a CI backlog, and for quickly reviewing changed documentation?
