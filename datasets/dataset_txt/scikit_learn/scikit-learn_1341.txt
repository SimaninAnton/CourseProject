Description
I'm trying to use libsvm to predict probability, and I'm using following command:
print(svm.libsvm.predict(x, 3, 'rbf', 3, 0.05, 0.0))
It follows from the documentation, args are:
X: array-like, svm_type: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, kernel: {'linear', 'rbf' ...} degree: int, gamma: float, coef0: float
But it gives me the following error:
Argument 'support' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got int). I've gone through the source code, but am not sure what the params like support etc. mean in the function predict. It will be great if there is more information about the params in the code, and the documentation for the function includes all params.
