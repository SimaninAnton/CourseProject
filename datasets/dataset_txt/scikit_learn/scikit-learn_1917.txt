Description
BaggingRegressor will raise an exception:
ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64').
I propose relaxing this constraint as the wrapped regressor should already handle checking of their input arrays. At best, the check is redundant. At worst, I can't reuse this component.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Create pipeline that includes varying methods of imputation and wrap it with a BaggingRegressor and run it on input containing nan/infinity.
