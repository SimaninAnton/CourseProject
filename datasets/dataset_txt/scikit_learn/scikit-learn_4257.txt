When I calculate recall and precision scores, the respective functions have a parameter to set the "positive label" (required to determine True Positives, True Negatives etc.) which can be set via pos_labe (default:1), e.g.,
sklearn.metrics.recall_score(..., pos_label=1, ...)
However, the cross_validation function does not have such a parameter.
Thus, when I call the function for cross validation, e.g.,
sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score(... scoring='precision', ...)
I am wondering if the positive label is also "1" by default.
Maybe it would be worthwhile to add the pos_lab parameter to cross_validation
