I have a feature extractor that uses max_features.
With a reasonably large collection, serializing the feature extractor can lead to unnecessarily large files because of the attribute stop_words [1]. It contains the features that don't make into the vocabulary (for which max_features is a possible reason).
As far as I can see, it's never used anywhere so I was wondering if I could get rid of it (i.e. set to None) before serialization. This shouldn't change the feature extractor's behavior after serialization.
