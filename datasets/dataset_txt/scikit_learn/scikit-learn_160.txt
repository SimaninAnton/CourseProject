Here is an issue that I came across with Count Vectorizer and its use with Column Transformer and Pipelines

I found a work around using by removing the column name to be processed directly instead of just a list.
This may be the way that it is intended to function, but if not, a simple bug fix would be just to add a simple line of code to change the list of column names to the content of the list if the length of the list is one.
