I am looking at the code for decision tree, and the document[1] does not describe what the arguments for fit function, sample_mask and X_argsorted, are. I figured out by reading code what X_argsorted is, but still have hard time understanding sample_mask. Perhaps explanation on these arguments should be included in [1].
