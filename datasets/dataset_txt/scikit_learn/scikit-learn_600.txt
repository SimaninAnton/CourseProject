Hi,
Its not an issue, rather a question for my understanding. I am a beginner in python. I was going through this: scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/_criterion.pyx
to understand how decision tree regressor splits. Was looking through class (MSE) and function proxy_impurity_improvement. Though we should get mean square error as output, I think it is giving sum of squared target variables. I couldn't find adjustment of mean in sum_left or sum_right anywhere. Can someone please explain me how is it working? Shall be really helpful. Thanks. #
