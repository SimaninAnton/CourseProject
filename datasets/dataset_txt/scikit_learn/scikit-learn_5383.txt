I am getting a vast number of errors when running the test suite after building and installing on OSX 10.7 with Xcode 4.3.2, and a very recent Numpy build. Here is the output:

Many of the errors are underflows in exp. Note that I am building everything with clang due to issues that Numpy has when trying to build with LLVM.
I am using the most recent GitHub source from master. I tried installing from pip, with much the same result. Let me know if you need additional details.
