When trying to cluster the old faithful data set from [1] and the data set from [2] both the DPGMM and VBGMM are unable to find a suitable fit. It looks as if the component weights are not updating properly as they remain at 1/K after fitting the model. I've attached an example script which contains 2 example data sets where this problem is displayed.
