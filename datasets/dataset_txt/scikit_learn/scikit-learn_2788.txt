so I'm translating andrew ng's matlab code to python in the first exercise , I have to feature normalize (we haven number of bedrooms (1-6) and Price(30000-40000) so its obvious that feature scaling is necessary here , but here is the problem :
regr = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, n_jobs=1)
regr.fit(X[:,0:n], y.ravel())
regr.score(X[:,0:n],y.ravel())
0.7329450180289141 OK, all good now with normalization (notice the normalize = True)
regr = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=True, copy_X=True, n_jobs=1)
regr.fit(X[:,0:n], )
regr.score(X[:,0:n],y)
0.7329450180289141 same score!! Am i doing something wrong here? please help im very confuse d also when I predict regr.predict(np.array([2104,3]))
I get the same prediction so its clearly not working
