After @MechCoder fixed kneighbors_graph in #4046, we should check all uses in the code for whether we want include_self==True or not. I came across this in SpectralEmbedding where the current default makes no sense, I think.
You can simply git grep and should find a lot of occurrences.
If our test output wasn't so flooded with warnings, we would have probably detected that earlier :-/
