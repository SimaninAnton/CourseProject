Hello
I have tried to install and import the sklearn module into Python34, but failed.
I tried to make the installation test with the following command:
C:\Python34\python.exe -c "import nose; nose.main()" -v sklearn
And the traceback was:
FAIL: sklearn.tests.test_metaestimators.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\no
self.test(*self.arg)

AssertionError: True is not false : Pipe
its delegate does not
Ran 2238 tests in 190.327s
FAILED (SKIP=19, errors=58, failures=2)
Don't know what's wrong, please need support. :)
