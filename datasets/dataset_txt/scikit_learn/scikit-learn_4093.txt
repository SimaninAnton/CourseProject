We have 479 PEP8 inconsistencies in the master. This pastebin file contains the entire list.
I would like to fix these all... but there is a definite possibility of merge conflicts with several PRs... Is fixing all this in a single PR recommended? ( Fixing part by part along with other PRs clutters the diff of other PRs and makes it not so easy to review the more significant changes in those PRs... )
