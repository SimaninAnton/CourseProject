So Adaboost gets as default argument base_estimator=DecisionTree().
This is bad for two reasons:
It is ugly. It doesn't cause any bugs because base_estimator is always cloned. But we should really avoid mutable defaults.
It breaks sphinx. That means the API doc for AdaBoost is not generated.
Setting the default argument to None is not a real option as that doesn't allow grid-searching the parameters of base_estimator with the default value.
We could in principle set change base_estimator in __init__ but that would violate our policies and mean that None is not a valid parameter setting for base_estimator in grid searches.
ping @NelleV for the sphinx issue.
