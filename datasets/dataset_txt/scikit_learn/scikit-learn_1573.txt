Hello Scikit Comunity,
In order to validate one of my hypothesis, I want the Random Forest to be able to draw the candidate features for split using weight sampling without replacement.
I wonder whether I only need to change the function on the following line:
scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx
Line 1287 in 6919a22
 f_j = rand_int(n_drawn_constants, f_i - n_found_constants, 
, and permutate the weight feature as well. Or it would be more complicated.
Could someone shed a light on this issue?
Thanks in advance.
