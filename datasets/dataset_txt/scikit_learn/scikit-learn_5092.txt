From what I can tell the svm's aren't being trained in parallel and therefore no matter how many cores are thrown at it, it only uses one.
Can we consider something like http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html#f432 ?
or http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/zanni06a/zanni06a.pdf
Thanks,
Note: please tell me if i'm very wrong in this regard :)
