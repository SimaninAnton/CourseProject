Description
With certain input data, the LogisticRegression class is reliably crashing Python (without an error message) when fit() is called.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Please see: https://github.com/fairlearn/sklearn-repro
This repository contains pickled data, the outputs of pip freeze and a sample script. As noted, the script successfully completes with v0.21.3, but crashes silently with v0.22
Expected Results
Either a successful completion (i.e. the final log message appears) or some sort of usable error message.
Actual Results
Python crashes.
