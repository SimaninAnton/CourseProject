After introducing failure mode if sphinx complete with warnings (which is good thing :)), I can observe a side effect that could be solved. Even if the job fails, the artifacts are uploaded and therefore we can check doc/_changed.html. @larsoner introduced the GitHub app allowing redirecting to these artifacts which is really handy. However, because the job is declared as failed, the shortcut does not appear in the PR next to the other CIs icons, meaning that you need to go to the artifacts manually. Is there a way to still show the shortcut even with a failed job if the artifacts have been uploaded?
@larsoner should probably know about this :)
