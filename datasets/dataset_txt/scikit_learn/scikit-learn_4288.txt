The output shape for multi-label predict_proba is inconsistent :-(
The OneVsRest classifier produces (n_samples, n_classes) (like multi-class)
where for example RandomForestClassifier produces a list of probabilities per label, which are each (n_samples, 2) or (n_samples, 1).
Not sure how to do a deprecation for that.
But we should do a common test for whether a classifier supports multi-label and what the output shapes are.
