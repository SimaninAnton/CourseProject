Describe the bug
When I clone a class, rather than instance of that class, I get error message saying that 'get_params is not implemented', even though it is
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.base  import clone
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
clone(LogisticRegression)
Expected Results
# TypeError Cannot clone object '<class 'sklearn.linear_model.logistic.LogisticRegression'>' (type <class 'type'>): it is a class rather than an instance of a class.
Actual Results
# TypeError: Cannot clone object '<class 'sklearn.linear_model.logistic.LogisticRegression'>' (type <class 'type'>): it does not seem to be a scikit-learn estimator as it does not implement a 'get_params' methods.
LogisticRegression.get_params
# <function sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.get_params(self, deep=True)>
This should be quite straightforward to fix, we could just change the comparison here to two different comparisons with different warnings. The current warning is unclear, and makes debugging harder.
