Description
Hi,
I search for modifying files _tree.pyd, _criterion.pyd and tree.py under sklearn/tree in order to add new split criterion other than gini and entropy already coded. How can I proceed to make changes on the pyd files please? I already downloaded scikit-learn-master and modify files under scikit-learn-master/sklearn/tree. The compilation with easycython of .pyx files generate many warnings such as
Extension name _criterion does not match fully qualified name 'sklearn.tree._criterion' of '_criterion.pyx'.
There is an example of the warnings in the attached file.
Is it true to compile with easycython under scikit-learn-master/sklearn/tree and copy the generated compiled files for use under site-packages/sklearn/tree?
