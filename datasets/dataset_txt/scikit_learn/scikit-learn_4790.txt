The argument to be passed to the scoring parameter of GridSearchCV for AUC is "roc_auc" although the metric is called "auc_score", not "roc_auc_score".
I know that using AUC alone can be ambiguous but most people use the name to refer to the one under the ROC curve (as opposed to the one under the precision-recall curve).
I'd suggest to create an alias, unless we want to rename "auc_score" to "roc_auc_score"?
