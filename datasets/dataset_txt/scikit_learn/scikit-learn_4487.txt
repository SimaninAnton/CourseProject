See http://www.diveintopython3.net/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html#zip for an elaboration of the differences.
#2925 deals with one case, but there are a decent number of cases that can be addressed.
In general it should improve performance (though most likely not significantly) for Python 2 (and will have no change for Python 3), as the majority of cases are of the form:
for a, b in zip(x, y):
  ...
and the Python 3 zip will not construct a full list as a temporary, whereas Python 2's zip will.
I'm happy to make the modifications, if a more senior member will support this as a useful change.
