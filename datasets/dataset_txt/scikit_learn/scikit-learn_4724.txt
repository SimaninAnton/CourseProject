In Windows, 32bit, mingw compiler, the new neighbors module doesn't work, and I get the following errors:
File "binary_tree.pxi", line 223, in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.get_memview_NodeData_1D (sklearn\neighbors\kd_tree.c:3071)
  ValueError: Buffer dtype mismatch; next field is at offset 12 but 16 expected
ping @jakevdp , @ogrisel, any clues?
