Hi,
In svm.SVR, the online documentation says it has predict_proba and predict_log_proba just like SVC, but these are not implemented in SVR.
Also, the description (both in SVR and SVC) is:
"Compute the log likehoods each possible outcomes of samples in X.
The model need to have probability information computed at training time: fit with attribute probability set to True."
I think this should read "Compute the log likelihoods of each of the possible outcomes for the samples in X. The model needs..."
On the same page, " Also, it will meaningless results on very small datasets." is missing a verb.
