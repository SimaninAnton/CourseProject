Trying a fresh install in a new machine, via pip3 install --user scikit-learn, it fails to install scikit-learn-0.15.0.tar.gz with
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy/distutils/exec_command.py", line 197, in exec_command

    if _with_python and (0 or sys.__stdout__.fileno()==-1):

ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached
any clue of what is going wrong ?
