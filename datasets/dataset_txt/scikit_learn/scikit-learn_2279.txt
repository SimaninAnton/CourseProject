Description
Looking at the doc for model_selection.train_test_split, it seems that there is no default specified for the random_state parameter (and also doesn't suggest that None is a valid value). Looking at the code, it appears that the default value is None, and in this case it returns the same RandomState singleton used by np.random (based on the spec of utils.validation.check_random_state here).
If you think that this should be documented in the docstring for train_test_split, I would be happy to submit a PR.
