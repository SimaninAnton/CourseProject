I was pleasantly surprised that overall scikit-learn built/tested fine across a wide range of platforms despite problems with test_gpr on good old i386 (#7544): https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=scikit-learn&suite=unstable
but was amused to see that on armel (only) it fails with
======================================================================
FAIL: sklearn.metrics.tests.test_classification.test_matthews_corrcoef
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nose/case.py", line 197, in runTest
    self.test(*self.arg)

AssertionError: No warning raised when calling matthews_corrcoef
so wondered if I should just skip this test there or patch (submit PR) to skip those specific checks on armel or really someone would like to look deeper why on armel no warning is raised?
