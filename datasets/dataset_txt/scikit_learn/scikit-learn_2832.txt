Description
I cloned the repo and cd in doc folder then run:
make html-noplot
after that I browser http://localhost:8000/html/stable/modules/linear_model.html for preview. The math: \hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + ... + w_p x_p doesn't render correctly

WARNING: sphinx.ext.pngmath has been deprecated. Please use sphinx.ext.imgmath instead.
So I changed sphinx.ext.pngmath to sphinx.ext.imgmath in conf.py
