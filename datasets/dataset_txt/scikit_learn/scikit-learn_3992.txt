Since #3327, any class / function that is not included in any example throws
/home/andy/checkout/scikit-learn/doc/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.libsvm.predict.rst:8: SEVERE: Problems with "include" directive path:
InputError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'modules/generated/sklearn.svm.libsvm.predict.examples'.
when building the docs.
I think we should just make sure to generate empty rst files, as I suggested in #3327.
