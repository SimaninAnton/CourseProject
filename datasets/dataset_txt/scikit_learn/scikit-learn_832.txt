Description
This is a feature request.
The fit of a model can be evaluated by plotting or looking at Gini scores ie., best fit implies that the gini score of that particular sample is zero.
Ginis are given out in by the _criterion.pyx under sklearn.tree, but there's need for a simple method for
printing out Gini Scores.
