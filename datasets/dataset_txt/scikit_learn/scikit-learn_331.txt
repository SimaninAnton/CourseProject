from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifierCV

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
RidgeClassifierCV(scoring='accuracy').fit(X, y)
errors because the fake estimator that's constructed in RidgeGCV is a regressor and the predict method returns the scores, not the predictions.
