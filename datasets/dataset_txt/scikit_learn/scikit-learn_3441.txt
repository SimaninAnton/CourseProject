Given the shape of X = (1, 58181) and Y = (2497564, 58181), where X and Y are both sparse matrix returned by tfidf_transformer, and X is a query. So the problem is when these are passed into the pairwise_distance function as follows
        result = pairwise_distances(X,
                                    Y,
                                    'cosine',
                                    n_jobs=4)[0]
I get these errors https://gist.github.com/Jeffrey04/0fcd73aef4229a49665d
So it works properly for n_job=1, and n_job=2, but any bigger value it returns that error, erm, am I doing anything wrong somewhere?
