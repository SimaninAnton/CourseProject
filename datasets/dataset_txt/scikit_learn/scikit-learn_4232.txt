Calling predict, transform, etc. on an estimator that first requires fit often results in an AttributeError (e.g. coef_ attribute not found). A more appropriate error message (and perhaps error class) should be raised, along the lines of b1119bb.
jnothman/scikit-learn@scikit-learn:master...jnothman:unfitted-error includes some basic tests for most scikit-learn estimators, but currently many estimators fail. Working from that branch (and modifying the tests if necessary), appropriate exceptions should be raised in the remaining estimators.
