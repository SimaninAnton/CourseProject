I don't understand why the behavior of ElasticNet and enet_path are different in the multioutput case.
The function enet_path calls directly a cython function enet_coordinate_descent_multi_task when y.ndim != 1(coordinate_descent.py--l456). The class ElasticNet call enet_path for each y[:, k] without using the enet_coodinate_descent_multi_task option of enet_path (coordinate_descent.py--l709).
The two ways of computing seems similar.
Someone can explain me what is the difference between the two computations ?
Or maybe we can remove some code ???
