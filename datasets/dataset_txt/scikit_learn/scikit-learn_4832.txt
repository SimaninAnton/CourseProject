While SVC supports custom callable kernels, KernelPCA does not. Precomputed kernel is still supported however. I am not sure about other kernel-based methods.
It would be very useful to be able to provide a custom kernel to KernelPCA too.
I am more interested in a custom distance function, but a custom kernel will do too.
The reason I want something other than current provided kernels is that I know my features can be circularly shifted (for fixed but unknown delta), therefore I want to use circular cross correlation to measure distance.
I appreciate if you let me know if there is a better way to do this, and if this is a worthy effort at all.
(also let me know if I should have discussion on a mailing list before adding an issue in the future)
