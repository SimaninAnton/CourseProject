I feel it would be helpful for developers to have a quick list of all the implemented tests in all the modules.. This could be either a wiki / a tests page under the developer section of the documentation web page.
This could be autogenerated using sphinx. Under separate directory using separate sphinx configuration perhaps?
This could be a single long page with just the test function names and the associated docstring.
Accordingly we could refactor the explanation currently available in most tests as 1 or two line comments to docstrings.
Excluding the setup effort, there is no additional effort on the developer who will be writing the tests. ( Just that instead of line comments they will have to include them as docstrings. No docstrings are also fine )
We could also link the function names to source code, so a new dev can quickly refer the same.
