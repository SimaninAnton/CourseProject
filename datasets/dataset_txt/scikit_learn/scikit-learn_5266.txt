I'm curious what techniques or modifications I would need to make where I'm trying to train with an asymmetry in my labels -- specifically, if I were to have:
Two labels, say 0 and 1, and to train a classifier to predict them. I care only about the ability to predict 1, meaning I want to minimize error rate of 1 without caring too much about error rates predicting 0. Are there components in scikit-learn that would help me with this? Or modifications I might make to typical classification approaches?
Thanks,
