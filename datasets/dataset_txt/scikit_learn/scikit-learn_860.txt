Hello, i met a problem. I test my code with the train and test samples specified in dataset and i get accuracy_1 (for example). I test my code with train and test samples splitted by train_test_split and i get accuracy_2 (for example), and the number of test samples is same as the number of test samples specified in dataset. But the gap between accuracy_1 and accuracy_2 is very large. accuracy_2 is higher than accuracy_1. I am troubled by this. Thank you for your help.
