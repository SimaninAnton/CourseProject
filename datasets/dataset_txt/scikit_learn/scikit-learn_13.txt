Ran into this issue whilst working on the plotting of decision trees. When we try to plot a decision tree which has not yet been fitted, the error that is raised is:
AttributeError: 'DecisionTreeClassifier' object has no attribute 'tree_'
To replicate:
clf = sk.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2,
min_samples_split=2,
criterion="entropy",
random_state=2)
sk.tree.plot_tree(clf)
My suggestion would be to simply add a NotFittedError there.
What do you think?
