Newer versions of setuptools, and the version of pip which was just released onto pypi, expect version names to follow pep 440. Version names that don't follow this standard will be called 'legacy' versions and will be treated as older than any non-legacy versions. I see that scikit-learn currently uses 0.16-git which under this scheme will be counted as older than its non-git versions, for example 0.7.1. SciPy and NumPy have been using similarly free-form names, and the pip devs have suggested to change - to + in the version name to placate the parser.
>>> import pkg_resources
>>> pkg_resources.parse_version('0.16-git')
<LegacyVersion('0.16-git')>
>>> pkg_resources.parse_version('0.16+git')
<Version('0.16+git')>
