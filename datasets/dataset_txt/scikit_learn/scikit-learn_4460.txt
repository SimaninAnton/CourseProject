This is only regarding the website http://scikit-learn.org/. I hope this is the right way to post it.
I really appreciate the great documentation you guys have created. Just sometimes you have links that are completely impossible to spot. For example the first link in this section: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression is a link, but it is completely indistinguishable from all the bold black text on http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html#sklearn.linear_model.Ridge of which none are links.
I think this happens because the tt.pre class overrides the link coloring. I think either making these documentation links always blue or always underlined would make the website a lot easier to navigate.
