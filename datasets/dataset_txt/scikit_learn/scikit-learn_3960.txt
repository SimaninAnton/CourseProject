Does scikit-learn have any capacity for partial dependence plots and associated data arrays for random forest analyses?
I can find the plot for GradientBoostingRegressor here http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_partial_dependence.html.
Doing the same for RF outputs:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/ensemble/partial_dependence.py", line 239, in plot_partial_dependence
    raise ValueError('gbrt has to be an instance of BaseGradientBoosting')
ValueError: gbrt has to be an instance of BaseGradientBoosting
