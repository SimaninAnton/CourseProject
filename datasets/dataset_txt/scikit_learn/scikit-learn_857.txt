I think the documentation of QuantileTransformer should say how it is implemented. There is even a stats.stackexchange question about it and we could take some elements of the answer.
Besides I was thinking that to map to a uniform distribution, the implementation was just computing the empirical cdf of the columns but it does not seem to be the case.
