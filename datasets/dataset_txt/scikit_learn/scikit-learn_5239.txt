The current narrative documentation for Lasso and ElasticNet regression is very mathematical and does not give practical hints on the usage of those models as remarked by this user on StackOverflow. We should quickly explain why L1 penalty and L1 + L2 penalty are interesting in practice rather than just mathematically.
Ideally a "Pros vs Cons" section comparing Lasso, ElasticNet and a reference to RandomizedLasso for regression and / or feature selection.
Also add links to SGDRegressor with matching loss and penalties for the low penalized and large n_samples case.
