Description
Hashing Feature Transformation states that PCA was used to do dimensionality reduction to 2 dimensions. However, in reality, truncated SVD is used.
Though they are similar for usage intent, I think it may be less confusing for a reader of the examples if the two were harmonized, either such that PCA is used as the dimensionality reduction tool, or such that the non-code portions of the text all refer to "Truncated SVD" instead of "PCA". I am happy to make a PR for this documentation change if the devs would find it useful.
