When transpose='auto', the behavior of randomized_svd is the opposite of the docstring and code comments:
from the doc string:
def randomized_svd(M, n_components, n_oversamples=10, n_iter=0,
                   transpose='auto', flip_sign=True, random_state=0):
    """    
    ...
    transpose: True, False or 'auto' (default)
        Whether the algorithm should be applied to M.T instead of M. The
        result should approximately be the same. The 'auto' mode will
        trigger the transposition if M.shape[1] > M.shape[0] since this
        implementation of randomized SVD tend to be a little faster in that
        case).
    ...
    """
from the code:
    n_samples, n_features = M.shape

    if transpose == 'auto' and n_samples > n_features:
        transpose = True
    if transpose:
        # this implementation is a bit faster with smaller shape[1]
        M = M.T
I am unsure which behavior is actually intended or optimal.
