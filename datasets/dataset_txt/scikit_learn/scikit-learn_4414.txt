Would be defined as
    def fit(self, X, y, verbose=False):
    ...
When verbose=True, will show the abs(err[-1]-err[-2]) compared to set threshold.
Preferably output every few seconds, just to give a sense of ongoing crunching.
Also, i would love if there is also an option for time bounded iterations for convergence.
    def fit(self, X, y, verbose=False, convergeWithinSeconds=None):
    ...
This is my first submission ever, so please tell me if you find this insane.
