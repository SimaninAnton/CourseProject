Description
The default token_pattern in sklearn.feature_extraction.text is u'(?u)\b\w\w+\b'. This pattern will ignore token with only one character. But for the general usage of sequential data vectorization, token with one character may also matter. I spend whole day to debug my code until I find all my single character tokens are ignored by default in sklearn.
This should be an easy fix, just change u'(?u)\b\w\w+\b' to u'(?u)\b\w+\b'
I can make a pull request if you think it is necessary.
