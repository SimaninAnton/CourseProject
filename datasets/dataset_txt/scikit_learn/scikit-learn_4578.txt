I noticed that there were no Associative Learning Algorithms such as:
Apiori Alogorithm
Equivalence Classification Algorithm (Eclat)
PrefixSpan
FP-Growth
All of them are used to detect combination of patterns in a dataset.
Some of them are kind of difficult to implement I would say about 200 lines of code?
