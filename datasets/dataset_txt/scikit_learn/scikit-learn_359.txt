Dear community,
I have been using sklearn to do some heavy clustering using KMeans. I am running my code on a linux machine with 90 cores and 500GB of RAM.
I have specified n_jobs=-1 and it seems to be working smoothly however, at some point I got the following warning:
/opt/Open_Soft/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/externals/loky/process_executor.py:706: UserWarning: A worker stopped while some jobs were given to the executor. This can be caused by a too short worker timeout or by a memory leak.
  "timeout or by a memory leak.", UserWarning
My versions: python 3.7.3, sklearn: 0.20.3.
Can I safely ignore this UserWarning?
