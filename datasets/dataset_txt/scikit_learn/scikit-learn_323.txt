The user guide currently has the following example:
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
  
    >>> X = np.ones(10)
    >>> y = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3)
    >>> for train, test in skf.split(X, y):
    ...     print("%s %s" % (train, test))
    [2 3 6 7 8 9] [0 1 4 5]
    [0 1 3 4 5 8 9] [2 6 7]
    [0 1 2 4 5 6 7] [3 8 9]
I think it would be much more instructive to show the class distributions for training and test set instead, and maybe create a slightly larger dataset to show the effect more clearly? Or compare against what KFold would do (which would be pretty disastrous in this case)
