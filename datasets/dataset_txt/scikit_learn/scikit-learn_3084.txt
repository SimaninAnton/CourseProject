In documentation for linear_model the title of the page was generalized linear models.
GLM refers to models which have fewer predictors than observations, and follow a distribution from an exponential family. While lasso, ridge, etc. are used in situations when you have many more predictors than observation (and often without a distribution assumption), and are classified as shrinkage methods, or regularized regression methods, or sparse regression methods, or penalized regression methods.
The Wikipedia article on GLM does not mention anything like lasso or ridge regression. I think putting lasso, ridge regression, etc. in a class called Generalized linear model is confusing.
It would be great if members could give their view on this confusion ?
