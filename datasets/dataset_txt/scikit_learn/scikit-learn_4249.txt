I just upgraded scikit from 0.14 to 0.15.1 to take advantage of the speed improvements in the random forest classifier. However, when I tried loading the model created (using 0.14), it fails to load it. Here is the error. Please advice. Iâ€™m simply loading it as follows. Thanks a lot.
Code:
with open(model_file, 'r') as fmodel:
    rf = pickle.load(fmodel)
Error:
File "/home/pranav/links/projects/generator/generator/apply_ml_model.py", line 184, in recommend_links
rf = pickle.load(fmodel)

Is there a workaround other than creating a new model with v15.1? Looks like this was resolved in a previous version. Check this link:
