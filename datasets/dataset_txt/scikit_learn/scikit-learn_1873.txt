Description
I have just intalled scikit-learn though pip. I am trying to load a dataset (california_housing) but I keep getting a permission error when scikit-learn tries to delete the file.
I can delete the file myself from the file explorer, which suggests that it is python that locks the file.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
housing = fetch_california_housing()
Expected Results
No error should be thrown and data should be loaded correctly
Actual Results
Downloading Cal. housing from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5976036 to C:\Users\lucia\scikit_learn_data
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test.py", line 4, in
housing = fetch_california_housing()
File "C:\Users\lucia\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\sklearn\datasets\california_housing.py", line 109, in fetch_california_housing
remove(archive_path)
PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\Users\lucia\scikit_learn_data\cal_housing.tgz'
