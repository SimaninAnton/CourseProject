check_X_y has an optional force_all_finite parameter that checks for finite values on X.
It seems that input checking for y is done anyway.
X = np.random.randn(10, 10)
y = np.random.randn(10)
y[0] = np.inf
check_X_y(X, y, force_all_finite=False)
ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')
This should be either documented or improved
