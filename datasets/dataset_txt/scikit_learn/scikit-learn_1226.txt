numpy.full(shape, value) is a more efficient way of creating arrays with constant value than np.ones(shape)*value as it saves one memory allocation, as suggested by @GaelVaroquaux
It is included since numpy 1.8 I think.
It could be worth replacing the occurrences of np.ones with np.full in the code-base when that is applicable.
