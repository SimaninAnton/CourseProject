As we all known, Python has a build-in sqlite3 module.
In my view, if we can use the sqlite3 as our data format, maybe we can improve speed and structure of data. Also, the format is cross-platform format which can write-and-read from any platfrom which support ansi-c.
The best of all is using sqlite3, we can convert data to another format more easily by using the tool-chain of sqlite3.
