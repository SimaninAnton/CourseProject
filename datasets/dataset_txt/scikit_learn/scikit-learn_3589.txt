When I use cross_val_score in scikit-learn's Linear Regression, the score will not change even if you re-split X and y using train_test_split.
test code here:
import pandas as pd #I used pandas.DataFrame for X
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn. cross_validation import cross_val_score

#set your own X and y here

i=0
while(i<100):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
    print X_train[:5] #X_train has changed 
    regressor = LinearRegression()
    regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)
    scores = cross_val_score(regressor, X, y, cv = 5)
    print "cross cv=5: ", scores.mean(), scores #why scores remain the same value?
    i += 1
