Using the kmeans clustering to cluster a csr matrix of 10,000x8,000 or greater dimension has produced a segmentation fault in a title clustering application I am working on.
We have started using a recursive hierarchical clustering to avoid the issue, but as this has produced less optimal results it is in our interest to solve the segmentation fault.
