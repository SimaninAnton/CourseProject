Hi!
Recently I noticed that there is no good implementation of Structural Topic Model (https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com, https://scholar.princeton.edu/files/bstewart/files/stmnips2013.pdf) in Python. Do you think it is an algorithm that is worth including in scikit-learn?
If yes, I am willing to contribute with code.
Thanks!
