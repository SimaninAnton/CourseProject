Description
Error message for invalid metric in NearestNeighbors is unclear.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
NearestNeighbors(metric='cheybshev')
Expected Results
Error message stating that metric should be 'cityblock', ... or callable rather than metric not valid for algorithm 'auto'. When I initially saw the error message, I did not realize I had a typo in the metric string. I thought it has something to do with the algorithm.
Actual Results
ValueError: Metric 'cheybshev' not valid for algorithm 'auto'
