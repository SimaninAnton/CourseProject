I'm using 0.16.0 and trying to understand the svc.fit_status_ logic.
When it's correctly fitted it is = 0?
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

X, y = make_classification()
svc = SVC(kernel='linear')
svc.fit(X, y)
print(svc.fit_status_)
gives
0
Is this attribute going to be deprecated, or shall we clarify it in the documentation? In any case, what would you recommand to check whether a clf has been fitted?
