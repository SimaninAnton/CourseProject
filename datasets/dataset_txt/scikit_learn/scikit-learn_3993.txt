In this example:
File "./text/document_classification_20newsgroups.py", line 211, in benchmark
    score = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, pred, average='micro')
TypeError: accuracy_score() got an unexpected keyword argument 'average'
@jnothman @arjoly can you confirm when this was removed / deprecated?
