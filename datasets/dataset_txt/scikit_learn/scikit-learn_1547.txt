users seem to be confused with the application of warm_start (#10658), particularly not realising that one should usually use it when re-fitting the model with the same or a super-sample of data, but with different parameters. I think referencing the glossary may help. All definitions of warm_start should say See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
