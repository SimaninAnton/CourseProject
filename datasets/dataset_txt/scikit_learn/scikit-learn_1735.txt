Description
Documentation puts:
children_ : array-like, shape (n_nodes-1, 2)
but it's supposed to be:
children_ : array-like, shape (n_samples-1, 2)
The rest of the documentation is correct, but this one line makes it seem as if each element of children_ corresponds to a node, when it only refers to the merging of nodes.
Also for a full tree n_nodes = 2*(n_samples-1) -1 so the documentation is off by about 2x.
