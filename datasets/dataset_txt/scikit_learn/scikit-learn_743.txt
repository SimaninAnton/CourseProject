I have been using Isolation Forest for outlier detection and I am in need of some help in handling unbalanced datasets.
My training dataset:
265000.0000 - 88383 instances
47000.0000 - 2 instances
39000.0000 - 1 instance
46000.0000 - 1 instance
I have a training data which has 88383 instances of the value 265000.0000 and 3 instances of some other values. I have tried all parameter combinations and whatever I set, every value I give as input is detected as inliner in prediction with the same score irrespective of how large or smalll value I provide.
Can you please guide me on how to tackle this problem? And is there any parameter which will cater to any dataset? We are looking to use this for payroll data - so, this month's prediction input will become next month's training data - hence looking for a way in which we can retrain every month automatically without changing any parameters.
Thanks in advance.
