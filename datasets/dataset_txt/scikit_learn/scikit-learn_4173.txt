Everything is in the title. This behaviour comes from the __iter__(self) method of ParameterSampler. By creating a generator that randomly picks each time values for every parameter independently, there is no way to prevent collision.
If n_iter is greater than a significant fraction of the grid cardinal, collision happens quite often, and RansomizedSearchCV launches the exact same CV several times. It seems at least inelegant, at most a significant waste of computational time :-)
I would also suggest a check on n_iter to be bounded by the grid cardinal, when RandomizedSearchCV becomes GridSerachCV.
