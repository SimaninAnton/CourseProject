I'm sure this has been proposed before, but I haven't been able to find a duplicate issue. Anyways, the idea is to enable StratifiedKFold in model_selection to handle multilabel (multiclass with non-mututally exclusive categories) data. If the number of labels is small, then ordinary stratified sampling on all possible combinations should work, otherwise one consideration might be to use the iterative approach suggested in http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/sechidis-ecmlpkdd-2011.pdf.
