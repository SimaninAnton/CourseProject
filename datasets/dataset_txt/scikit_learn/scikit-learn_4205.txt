Hi,
There is a formatting typo in the references section of http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.Isomap.html .
I think the problem is that on line 75 of the isomap implementation (
scikit-learn/sklearn/manifold/isomap.py
Line 75 in 1491c1c
     [1] Tenenbaum, J.B.; De Silva, V.; & Langford, J.C. A global geometric 
) the doc string has multiple lines when the one reference should on one line.
