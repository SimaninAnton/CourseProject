Is there a way to use a custom matrix in the sklearn sparse pca module? I would like to solve the problem $Ax=0$ with my custom matrix A, which is basically a kernel matrix with $A_{i,j}=\varphi(x_i, x_j)$ with $\varphi$ as a kernel of some type returning 1 (or zero, depends on the kernel) if the components $x_i$ and $x_j$ are very similar.
Thank you very much for any hint!
