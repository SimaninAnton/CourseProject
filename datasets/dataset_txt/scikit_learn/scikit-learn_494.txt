Description
This is a feature request to add the warm start parameter, which exists for gradient boosting, to the new histogram-based gradient boosting.
Rationale: We're using gradient boosting in Auto-sklearn, and fit each model until either the time (given by the user) is up, or the number of trees is reached. For sufficiently large datasets, it is possible that certain configurations time out. Therefore, if possible, we train models iteratively, and only add more trees if time allows. Since the new GBM implementation is really great (not only faster, but also better default accuracy for the problems I tried) we would like to use it within Auto-sklearn as a drop-in, ideally together with iterative training.
