Is there a rationale for having the default behavior of KFold be to return folds without random shuffling? This kind of threw me off...
See: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cross_validation.py#L307
I think there's benefit to having shuffle=True be the default and letting users opt out of shuffling, as I think that's the natural expectation.
Relatedly, is there a rationale for not having a shuffle option for StratifiedKFold? (If not, I can open up a PR).
