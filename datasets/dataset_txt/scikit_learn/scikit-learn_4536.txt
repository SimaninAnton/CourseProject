RandomizedSearchCV:
Draws with replacement. As a consequence, hyperparameter settings are tried more than once if n_iter > number of unique parameter configurations. No use in trying the same thing twice for deterministic algorithms.
Will try configurations which are equivelent due to conditional constraints, ie: a SVC with
{ "kernel" : "rbf", "degree" : 3}
is the same as
{ "kernel" : "rbf", "degree" : 4}
since the degree parameter is ignored when using rbf kernel.
Cannot tell how many unique parameterizations of the grid search there are, since the parameter set to try is drawn at each step instead of combinatorially evaluated. For distributions (where number is infinite), the number np.inf could be returned.
Are these considered shortcomings or deliberate design decisions?
