Hello,
I'm searching for the best parameters for an SVC classifier using grid_search.GridSearchCV. And I would like to pass in my own score_func (quadratic weighted kappa, for example). But grid_scores_ shows that the default score_func is used instead.
I also tried passing in loss_func, but haven't been able to affect the score_func used at all.
Please advise. Thanks a lot in advance!
