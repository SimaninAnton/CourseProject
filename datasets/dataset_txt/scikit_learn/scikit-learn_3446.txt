Not sure if I should delay the release for this, but this example is broken.
quotes_historical_yahoo was moved to quotes_historical_yahoo_ochl or quotes_historical_yahoo_ohlc. I don't know which is the right one, but they both give me segfaults.
That could just be my broken setup, though.
Can anyone with a new matplotlib try?
