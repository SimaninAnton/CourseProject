finance.quotes_historical_yahoo(symbol, d1, d2, asobject=True) gives a urllib2.HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found for symbol = 'DELL'
Looking into the implementation of matplotlib.finance.quotes_historical_yahoo, the request URL for DELL would be http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=DELL&a=01&b=1c=2003&d=01&e=01&f=2008&g=d&ignore=.csv . This gives a 404 error, as well.
So, my guess is that something changed with the symbol for DELL. Although, do we really need DELL in the list of symbols? Can it be simply removed?
