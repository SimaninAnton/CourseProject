When you use many Transformers that add and remove columns from your data, it is often hard to keep track which column was which. In such situations it would be very helpful to be able to assign names to columns.
I think this could be implemented in a subclass of numpy.ndarray. However, I am not familiar with the details of ndarray and I am not sure how well sklearn works with a subclass of ndarray (e.g. is somewhere data copied by creating a new instances of ndarray?). So, what do you think about this idea?
