I am building my model and storing it at a location using
joblib.dump(model, modelStoreLocation, compress=9)
Then in a separate execution I am trying to read the model from the location as show below :
# loading the model stored on disk model = joblib.load(modelStoreLocation)
I get the following error :
  File "/Users/venuktangirala/PycharmProjects/nFlate/compute/prediction/categories/logisticRegression.py", line 84, in <module>x
    prediction = predictDataFrame(dataFrame.ix[600:623, :-1].values, modelStoreLocation)
  File "/Users/venuktangirala/PycharmProjects/nFlate/compute/prediction/categories/logisticRegression.py", line 58, in predictDataFrame
    prediction = model.predict(dataToPredict)
  File "/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/base.py", line 223, in predict
    scores = self.decision_function(X)
  File "/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/base.py", line 207, in decision_function
    dense_output=True) + self.intercept_
  File "/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/utils/extmath.py", line 83, in safe_sparse_dot
    return np.dot(a, b)
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'`
The same works with out any problem when its in the same execution i.e. build the model , write to dsik and read from disk in the same execution.
What is the fix for this ?
