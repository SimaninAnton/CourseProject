I have a propose to create "StubScaler", which implements all methods as other scalers, but "transform" method returns copy of the input data. It will be useful for cases when you want to iterate through the list of scalers and choose the best one, so "StubScaler" will means that you should not scale your features. What do you think, will it be useful for somebody else?
