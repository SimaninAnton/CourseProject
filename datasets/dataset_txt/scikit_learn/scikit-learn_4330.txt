I just noticed that the one vs. rest implementation does an optimization whereby a class that is present in all training examples will not get a fitted estimator, but just a dummy _ConstantPredictor that always returns it.
This assumes that any sensible estimator will always classify instances as belonging to that class. This is not true for the DummyClassifier(strategy='uniform') which is often useful. I think this is a bug.
@ogrisel suggests having a parameter to explicitly turn off (or on) this optimization.
Ping @amueller (blamed by git for the _ConstantPredictor), @arjoly and @hamsal (because of actively working on OvR)
