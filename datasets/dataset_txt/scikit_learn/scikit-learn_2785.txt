We would like to add a feature union pipeline for input Pandas data frame. The feature union will extract a feature(s) for each named column(s) in the dataframe and will output a pipeline which can then be used in Scikit-Learn. Would this be approved by Scikit admins? The dependency will be only for users who will use this functionality by importing pandas only in that module.
see scikit-learn-contrib/sklearn-pandas#61 (comment) for details.
