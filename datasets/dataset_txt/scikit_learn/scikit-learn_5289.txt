testing today (Aug 12th) master.
the traceback is the following
$ python setup.py develop
Partial import of sklearn during the build process.
/usr/lib/python2.6/distutils/dist.py:266: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'zip_safe'
  warnings.warn(msg)
/usr/lib/python2.6/distutils/dist.py:266: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'include_package_data'
  warnings.warn(msg)
usage: setup.py [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]
   or: setup.py --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]
   or: setup.py --help-commands
   or: setup.py cmd --help

error: invalid command 'develop'
In setup.py there is already some machinery to handle setuptools extra commands.
A simple fix would be to try to import setuptools at the very beginning to setup.py:
try:
    import setuptools
except ImportError:
    pass
Do you see any problem with this solution?
