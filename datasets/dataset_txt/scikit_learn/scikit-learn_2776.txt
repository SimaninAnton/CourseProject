#6842 reported a problem where cumsum over float32 data led to bad sums. With #7331 merged, we should find other uses of cumsum in the repo where the input could be either float32 data or very large arrays of float64 data that could lead to instability. In such cases, sklearn.utils.extmath.stable_cumsum should be used.
