When fitting data with the multinomial HMM,
First, the number of symbols is undefined
Second, it crashes when unpacking a shape on the first line of the forward pass.
Here is how to reproduce the bug
import numpy
from sklearn import hmm

n_components = 2
n_symbols = 2
N = 5000

# Generator Multinomial Hidden Markov Model
transmat = numpy.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.25, 0.75]])
emissionprob_ = numpy.array([[0.85, 0.15], [0.4, 0.6]])
startprob = numpy.array([0.8, 0.2])

emitter = hmm.MultinomialHMM(n_components, startprob, transmat)
emitter.emissionprob_ = emissionprob_

observations, true_states = emitter.sample(N)

learner = hmm.MultinomialHMM(n_components)
# learner.n_symbols = n_symbols
learner.fit(observations)
The second bug is enlighten by uncommenting the second last line.
Thanks for this great library.
