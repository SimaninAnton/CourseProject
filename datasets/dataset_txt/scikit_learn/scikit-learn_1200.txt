Circle CI failure:
Seems that it's due to e888c0d, but I cannot figure out the reason.
Travis cron job failure:
See e.g., https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/builds/408877802
Typical log:
FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use
arr[tuple(seq)] instead of arr[seq]. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index,
arr[np.array(seq)], which will result either in an error or a different result.
