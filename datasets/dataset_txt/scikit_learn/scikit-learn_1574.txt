Description
There is a bug in sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif. When y have two samples like [0, 1], the result is not right.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif
    X = np.array([[4, 1, 0],
                  [5, 10, 0]])
    y = np.array([0, 1])
mutual_info_classif(X, y, discrete_features=True)
Expected Results
Value in the result should be different. But there are only two kinds of value, 0. and 0.69314718 no matter how I change the input X.
Actual Results
result = array([ 0.69314718, 0.69314718, 0. ])
I changed the number in X many times, but it wouldn't influence the result.
