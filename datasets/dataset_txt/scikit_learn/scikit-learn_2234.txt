I just found out about metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances and how it can use n_jobs to run the calculation in parallel. I'm very into this idea b/c I am limited to prototyping ideas when the distance matrix calculation takes a long time. This parallel methods definitely helps but it would be really useful if I could get a feel of the progress with a progressbar from tqdm or equivalent. Is this possible? pymc3 implements a progressbar although I'm not sure if it's written in pymc3 or if it uses tqdm in the backend.
