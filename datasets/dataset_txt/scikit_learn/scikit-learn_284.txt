I am using tree type algorithms with regression on scikit-learn.
But I do not understand how it calculates the importance of the features.
Classification is calculated by the Gini coefficient, which can be understood.
But regression uses RMSE or MAE.

Please tell me the process of calculation for importance on regression with tree type algorithms.
