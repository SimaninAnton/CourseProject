I believe it would be a great and rather unique feature to include a lookahead (best implemented as n-lookahead). Essentially, rather than only greedily choosing a split for a node, it could decide the best split "now" doing a search on the current and next level. Worst case would be O(N^2), but perhaps heuristics would follow (e.g. only consider extra depth for top % features etc).
I've started looking into it, but I do not have any Cython experience. Maybe it is an interesting challenge to the next person.
