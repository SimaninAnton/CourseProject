I am doing a binary classification, where both positive and negative identifications are important. My goal is to measure how well the classifier identifies positive instances and negative instances respectively. Below is my code to compute the AUC for positive and negative classes respectively.
y_true = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1])
y_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.35, 0.8])
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_scores, pos_label=1)
AUC_positive = auc(fpr, tpr)
print(AUC_positive)
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_scores, pos_label=0)
AUC_negative = auc(fpr, tpr)
print(AUC_negative)
The result is 0.75 and 0.25.
I also tried
y_true = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1])
y_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.35, 0.8])
The result is 0.666667 and 0333333.
It seems that the sum of AUC_positive and AUC_negative are always 1? I start to suspect I do not use the functions correctly here. I just want to confirm that I am on the right track.
Thanks.
