Some people are getting an issue after updating scikit-learn:
  File "/home/jupyter/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/sklearn/decomposition/__init__.py", line 19, in <module>
    from ._online_lda import LatentDirichletAllocation
ImportError: cannot import name 'LatentDirichletAllocation'
There an SO question about it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59240556/latentdirichletallocation-was-not-installed-in-decomposition-module-of-scikit-le
and we got an issue reported in imbalanced-learn: scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn#663
I assume that this is not just bad luck. However, I cannot reproduce it locally. It is for sure linked to the privatization of the online_lda module but I don't get how to trigger that.
NB: I will write an answer in the so because the "solution" is a really bad fix and if we could get feedback on this issue to solve it, it would be great.
