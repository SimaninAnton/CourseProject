Hi,
_graph_is_connected from sklearn.manifold.spectral_embedding_ consumes about 5 times as much memory as the input matrix. Could this be improved?
networkx.is_connected does not need any addional memory, maybe you may have a look at how they do it
https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/_modules/networkx/algorithms/components/connected.html#is_connected
(I haven't yet carefully checked if networkx.is_conneted does the same like sklearn!)
