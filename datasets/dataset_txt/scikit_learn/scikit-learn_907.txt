I am trying to extract non-overlapping patches
import cv2
from sklearn.feature_extraction import image

img = cv2.imread('example.bmp')

patches = image.extract_patches_2d(img, (128,128 ))
but the problem image.extract_patches_2d is for overlapping patches. Is there another code I can use to extract non-overlapping patches?
Thanks in advance
