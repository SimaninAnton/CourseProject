Because of some strange legacy validation in init (and set_params) as well as in fit and partial_fit (probably excessive in any case), the FutureWarning in BaseSGD is repeated when warn='always' is used. The FutureWarning should only be issued in uses of fit and partial_fit, and not during __init__ or set_params.
