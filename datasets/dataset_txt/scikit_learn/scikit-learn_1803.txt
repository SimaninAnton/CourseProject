Graphical Lasso is a method for sparse inverse covariance estimation.

Sklearn method
Graph Lasso is a method for sparse regression where the features lie on a graph.
ICML Paper
Not in sklearn.
These are different methods. Sklearn implements Graphical Lasso but not Graph Lasso, however I believe it wrongly calls Graphical Lasso GraphLasso, which causes some ambiguity. After a very quick search, it seems like the abiguity starts with this library (might be incorrect about this).
