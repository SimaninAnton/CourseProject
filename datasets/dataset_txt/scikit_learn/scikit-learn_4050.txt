At minimum, this could use a better error message. Is it not possible to have a project that depends on sklearn and installs all its dependencies to a virtualenv in a single pass? Must I do one pass to install numpy and everything else, and a second pass just to install sklearn?
$ python setup.py install
Partial import of sklearn during the build process.
