scikit-learn 0.19.1 not found in the default conda channel for conda <= 4.3.25
Contunued from #10237 (comment) cc @jnothman @amueller
Steps to reproduce
Dockerfile
FROM continuumio/miniconda:4.3.27

RUN conda install conda==4.3.25

RUN conda search scikit-learn | grep 0.19

RUN conda install scikit-learn==0.19.1
then
docker build --no-cache .
Expected output
Some lines with both 0.19.0 and 0.19.1 versions. No errors.
Actual output
Only 0.19.0 is seen, followed by the following error,
PackageNotFoundError: Packages missing in current channels:
            
  - scikit-learn ==0.19.1

We have searched for the packages in the following channels:
            
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/linux-64
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/noarch
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/r/linux-64
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/r/noarch
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/pro/linux-64
  - https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/pro/noarch
Additional details
Switching to conda 4.3.27 fixes it, while this error is present for earlier versions of conda, as far as I could tell. Probably related to the new compiler setup ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#7631.
