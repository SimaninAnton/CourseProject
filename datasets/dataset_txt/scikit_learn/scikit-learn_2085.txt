This code gives an error on scikit-learn version 0.18.2:
from sklearn import preprocessing
import numpy as np

X = [[ 1., -1.,  2.],
     [ 2.,  0.,  0.],
     [ 0.,  1., -1.]]
X_normalized = preprocessing.normalize(X, norm='l2')

print(X_normalized)  
Output:
C:\Users\Prakritidev Verma\Anaconda3\python.exe: can't find '__main__' module in ''
Pleae let me know if something is wrong in my code
