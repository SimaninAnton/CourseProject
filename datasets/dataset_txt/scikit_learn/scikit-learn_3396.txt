I understand that it slices list of tasks into batches, but why do we need it if joblib provides ability to automatically adjust batch size (from list of tasks), and it automatically groups your tasks into batches for each process. Even if you don't want to waste time onto automatic adjustion process - you can just set batch_size = int(n_tasks/n_jobs) and it will work in same way as explicit slicing.
