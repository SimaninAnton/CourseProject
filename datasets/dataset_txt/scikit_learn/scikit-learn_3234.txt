I have read #5147 and #5533 and #4907 but I do not know if perhaps there is a similar fix (exchanging residual_threshold for some comparable option in RandomizedLogisticRegression)?
My currently selected options used are:
rlgrg = RandomizedLogisticRegression(C=1, scaling=0.5,
                                     sample_fraction=0.7, n_resampling=500,
                                     verbose=True, normalize=False,
                                     random_state=None, n_jobs=1,                                   
                                    )
Thanks for sklearn and thanks in advance for your time and advice.
