Description
The description of the predict_proba method in sklearn.mixture.GMM is in my opinion misleading. This is currently the short description in the Methods section (version 0.18.1):
"Predict posterior probability of data per each component."
And in the description of the returned value it says:
"Returns the probability of the sample for each Gaussian (state) in the model."
This in my opinion implies that the returned value is p(x|component), whereas, looking at the code, the returned probability is p(component|x).
I suggest the description of the method to be changed to
"Predict posterior probability of each component given the data"
And the description of the returned value:
"Returns the probability of each Gaussian (state) in the model given each sample".
Best regards
