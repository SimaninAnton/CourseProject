An arbitrary default of n_clusters=8 seems to me an odd choice. When I first used the modules, I assumed the number of clusters was being chosen in an intelligent fashion.
Could someone explain the reasoning? I think that n_clusters should be a required parameter, rather than silently producing arbitrary results.
