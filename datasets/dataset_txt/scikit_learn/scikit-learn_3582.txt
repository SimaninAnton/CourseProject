Hello all!
I have implemented the Semi-Supervised HMRK Kmeans from theory to python code. (The experience was great).
I have it in my GitHub Repo git@github.com:dpritsos/Djumble.git.
I would really appreciate any feedback from you, the Sklearn contributors, the ML experts. Additionally in case you think that it would be useful for the Sklearn lib please give me some guide lines in order to appended in the Sklearn project.
I really appreciate any valuable time of yours might be spent on this implementation.
Best Regards,
Dimitrios Pritsos
