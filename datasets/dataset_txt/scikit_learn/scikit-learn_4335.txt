When the c_step of fast_mcd encounters a covariance matrix with a 0 determinant, it raises an error. According to the paper (Rousseeuw & Van Driessen 1999), it shouldn't be the case. Technically, 0-determinant covariance is the optimal solution. A singular case requires a special treatment. (Section 5 of the paper). I'm new here, but I can contribute to this.
