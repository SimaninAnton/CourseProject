Description
The implement of get_support_mask of SelectKBest is wrong.
The code is not actually picking the top K scored features.
Code url: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/feature_selection/univariate_selection.py#L499
Steps/Code to Reproduce
The source code is:
mask[np.argsort(scores, kind="mergesort")[-self.k:]] = 1
This should be wrong, the top k feature mask is:
mask[np.argsort(-scores, kind="mergesort") < k] = 1
