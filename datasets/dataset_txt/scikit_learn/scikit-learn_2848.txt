For people working with noisy/unreliable data like myself, it would be nice to have robust classifier available. I'm thinking about implementing robust LDA as the rrcov package in R. I see that there is already an implementation of Minimum Covariance Determinant which seems to me a good start. Could this be a worthwhile addition to sklearn?
