Description
The documentation of the PCA.fit method does not say what the parameter y does. When I read the docs, I was slightly confused since PCA is unsupervised and hence it does not need y.
After looking into the code, I realized that y is just ignored, however, I think this should be mentioned in the docs.
IncrementalPCA.fit has a short comment on this, but to me, it's not very clear.
Documentation of other unsupervised fitters has similar issues, e.g. TSNE
