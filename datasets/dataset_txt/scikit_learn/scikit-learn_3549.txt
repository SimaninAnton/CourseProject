Is there currently a way to create a pipeline that classifies the data, then does individual regressions on the data in each class (perhaps using different features)?
This has been done before, e.g. using a SOM + linear regression (Hsu et al, 2002).
If it isn't already possible, would something like this be worth including in sklearn? Or should I just make a separate project?
