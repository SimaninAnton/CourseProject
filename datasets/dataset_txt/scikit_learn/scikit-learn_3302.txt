I noticed that there's no repo recommendation on github.
However, I really like to explore interesting and powerful projects on github. I don't know how you guys search for good projects? For me, I go to see the github showcase, github trend, or just search for interesting topics.
If we can add a recommend system on github, it will be quite great. I definitely would like to spend more time on github.
Is there anyway to contribute for this? Can we acknowledge the github developers to get the user data(after encryption) for building model?
Anyone interesting in this?
