Hi all,
I am using the LinearRegression method and I got the following problem.
When I include more features than samples there is no warning in the regression routine.
In fact the problem is not well defined anymore since the arising matrix of the crossproduct of features is not invertible anymore.
What does the LinearRegression routine does in this case? Does it calculate a pseudo inverse? I could not find any information on that.
Thank you in advance.
Here my reproducible code:
import numpy as np
from sklearn import linear_model
N = 10 # Number of observations
P = 20 # Number of samples
Y = np.random.randn(N)
X = np.random.randn(N*P)
Y = Y.reshape(N,1)
X = X.reshape(N,P)
clf = linear_model.LinearRegression()
clf.fit(X, Y)
print clf.score(X, Y)
Cheers,
