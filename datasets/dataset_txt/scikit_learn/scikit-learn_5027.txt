I don't like saying this but to me it seems that the parameter labels of confusion_matrix should be called classes.
In general, we should do a git grep labels and git grep classes.
I think we use classes in most places now (in particular classifier.classes_) and we should probably not use the name labels anywhere.
Update
We use labels_ in clustering. I guess that should not be renamed to classes_ as that would be very confusing.
So do we keep labels_ there? And use classes everywhere in the supervised setting?
