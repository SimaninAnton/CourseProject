Description
In sklearn.linear_model module, LinearRegressor is the class used for performing ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression. I wonder why the learning rate (alpha) is not a configurable parameter for this. I think it should be configurable as well , as choosing the good learning rate has direct impact on the performance of the model. I'd like to work on this.
