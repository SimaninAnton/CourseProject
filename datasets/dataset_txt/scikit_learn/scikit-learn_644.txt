Description
As far as I can tell, I am running up into a limit for the columns when using make_column_transformer. Is there a method around this or the expectation that this limit might be removed in a future release?
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Here is what I am trying to do:
preprocessX = make_column_transformer(
    (StandardScaler(), ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "F", "G", "H", "I", 
    "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q"]),
    (OneHotEncoder(), ["R", "S", "R", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y"])
)
If I remove one or more letters from A through Q from the standard scalar portion, it works, so I am assuming there is some sort of hard limit in column count in place.
Expected Results
I expect to use all the columns in my prediction.
Actual Results
I am apparently hitting a hard limit in column count.
