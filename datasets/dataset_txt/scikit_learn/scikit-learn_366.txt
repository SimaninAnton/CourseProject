I asked this at https://stackoverflow.com/q/57272000/9172922 some days ago, but didn't received any answers yet.
Here's the situation:
I did a grid search and I want the model with best accuracy. As there can be many models with the same best accuracy score hence then among all models with best accuracy I want the model with the best recall score. eg:
model_1:    cm = [[80,  71]
                            [ 3, 246]]

model_2 :   cm = [[120,  11]
                            [ 23, 246]]

model_3 :   cm = [[120,  20]
                            [ 14, 246]]

model_4 :   cm = [[120,  30]
                             [ 8, 246]]  
As model_1 although have the highest recall i.e., 246/249, but it has the least accuracy score and we want refit to first look at the model with highest accuracy then only look at remaining metrics(in this case recall).
Remaining all three models have the same accuracy i.e., (120+246)/400, but model_2 has the least recall and model_4 has the highest recall i.e.,
246/(8+246). Hence model_4 should be the best final model splited by the grid search.
How can we do this?
OR
If the above situation can't be handled then I have a hack of doing it but it again arises a new question:
how to get all models with same metric score from grid search? 
because then I can sort them according to recall score and get the desired result.
