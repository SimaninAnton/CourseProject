In OPTICS, the automatic extraction algorithm actually returns all possible clusters, but currently we only provide users with the clusters on the leaves. I guess we can provide users with an option to get all these clusters. (R provides clusters_xi attribute).
ping @espg @adrinjalali (I think it's even more important for extract_Xi)
