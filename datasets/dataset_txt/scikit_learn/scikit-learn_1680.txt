Current message says "Classifier fit failed" but the estimator is not necessarily a classifier. (Perhaps that's too pedantic of me...)
%r is not technically the best way to display an error message. We could either use traceback.format_exc and include the whole traceback; or we can use traceback.format_exception_only to print it properly (though I think this is the same as "%s: %s" % (type(exc), exc)).
Another thing we can consider, now that _fit_and_score provides structured results to *SearchCV and cross_validate, is to store the full traceback in some array of *SearchCV.cv_results_.
