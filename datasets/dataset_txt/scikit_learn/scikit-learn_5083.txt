I just installed sklearn 61e2a71 with numpy 1.8.0.dev-b7b54cd on 64-bit Linux and get this crash trying to run the unit tests:
Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.

At least I think the problem is in sklearn.tree, I didn't look closely. The full log is here: https://gist.github.com/4245504
