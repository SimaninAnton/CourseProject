Hello,
I used to build my dataset on Matlab, create (DESCR, data and label) folders and i save them as one .mat file. Then i copy it to ~/scikit_learn_data/mldata and i import it into python 2.7 idle. It used to work very well using this command:
X = datasets.fetch_mldata("Mydataset")
Now i am trying to run my code on ipynb (i am new to this) and I am using the same command but i get this error:
HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Dataset 'Mydataset' not found on mldata.org.
Note: the file does exist in ~/scikit_learn_data/mldata
If i am not able to use the same way on ipynb, how can i import the .mat then ?
