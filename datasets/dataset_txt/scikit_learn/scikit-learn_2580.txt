Issues that had been merged to master where then cherry-picked into 0.18.1. Now the changelog in master and 0.18.1 are out of sync. At a minimum, it would be good for someone to move the changelog entries into the right places. It would also be amazing for someone to also check the commit log between 0.18.0 and 0.18.1 to find out if any substantial commits (not just documentation) are missing from the changelog.
