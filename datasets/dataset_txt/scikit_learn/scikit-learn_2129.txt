When feeding StratifiedKFold categorically encoded values (for example [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]...], it will throw an error, but when doing the same for stratified train_test_split or StratifiedShuffleSplit, it won't complain, but will output wrong values (e.g. in my experiments, the test set will contain elements of train values). This is because np.unique doesn't operate the same way on 2d arrays as it does on a list.
