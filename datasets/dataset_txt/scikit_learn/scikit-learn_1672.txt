Hi! I really like this page of documentation on the website:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_unveil_tree_structure.html
I've found it useful for explaining how my decision-tree classifiers work under the hood, especially to my non-technical colleagues, who find it helps to remove the black-box around these mechanisms.
I started writing a library that surfaces the logic presented on the website, with a couple of other enhancements, which you can find here: https://github.com/gfyoung/tree-decode
However, I thought it might be even better if this API of was simply internalized to the scikit-learn library. Would there be any interest in doing this?
