It can be pretty unpleasant when your grid search fails. That's why the error_score parameter was introduced. The default error_score='raise' helps make absolutely clear that there was a failure by terminating the program, but it might be kind to just set the score to NaN and raise a warning. We could consider deprecating it:
change the default temporarily to error_score='raise-deprecating'
continue to raise an error with 'raise-deprecating' but also warn that in the future, this error will not be raised, and the user can choose between error_score='raise' or the new default, error_score=np.nan.
change the default to error_score=np.nan in a couple of versions time
Other devs may want to give feedback on this idea before we go ahead with implementation/merge.
