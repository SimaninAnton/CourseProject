Is there any way of measuring the accuracy metrics between a multilabel-indicator format & a multiclass-multioutput
I am training a multilabel classification and my predicted values from classifier are multilabel-indicator while my x_test data is in the format of multiclass-multioutput .
So when I try to evaluate the accuracy values I get the error saying
1 frames
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/classification.py in _check_targets(y_true, y_pred)
79 if len(y_type) > 1:
80 raise ValueError("Classification metrics can't handle a mix of {0} "
---> 81 "and {1} targets".format(type_true, type_pred))
82
83 # We can't have more than one value on y_type => The set is no more needed
ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of binary and multilabel-indicator targets
