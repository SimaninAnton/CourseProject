We just installed a fresh 0.17.1 version of Scikit on Anaconda, and we have a very strange problem when applying the example shown on the http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html#plotting-learning-curves page. The example runs (though we have a normal warning explaining that the cross_validation.py and learning_curve.py modules are deprecated and will be removed in 0.20 in favor of the model_selection module), but the script never exits and shows nothing.
Is the script example wrong or did we do something wrong?
