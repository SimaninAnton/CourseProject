When I try to instantiate LinearSVC(penalty='l1', dual=False) I inconsistently get the error:
File "/usr/local/project/.env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/classes.py", line 145, in __init__
random_state=random_state)
File "/usr/local/project/.env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 610, in __init__
self._get_solver_type()
File "/usr/local/project/.env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 642, in _get_solver_type
+ error_string)
ValueError: Not supported set of arguments: penalty='l1' is only supported when dual='false'.
This is incredibly confusing because 1) it doesn't happen each time, and 2) I'm explicitly giving it the parameters it says I should be passing it.
Since I'm doing this instantiation from inside a process created by multiprocessing.Process, this feels like a race-condition. However, I'm only launching a one process at a time (so I can kill it if the algorithm runs too long).
Is this a bug, or does scikit's LinearSVC implementation not work with mulitprocessing? Is there anything else that could explain this error?
