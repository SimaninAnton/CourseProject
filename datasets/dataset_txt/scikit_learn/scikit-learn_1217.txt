To begin with, I want to apologise if this is "blatantly off-topic" (looking at you, StackOverflow!), but I could not think of a better place to ask this question.
I have recently started looking into Model-based Recursive Partitioning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04078), are you aware of any attempts of implementing them in our beloved scikit-learn framework (or even generally in Python)?
