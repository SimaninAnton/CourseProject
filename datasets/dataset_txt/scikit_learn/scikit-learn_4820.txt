This goes with #2017
Any type of rst code like for example links or math code must be shifted a little further down
in the docstring, as to keep the first 95 characters as normal text - This will allow the
docstrings to stay legible (as the rst doesn't render there, it's just text), when seen in the Examples gallery
I will do this shortly if no newcomer grabs it :)
