        Parameters 
     ---------- 
     assume_finite : bool, optional 
         If True, validation for finiteness will be skipped, 
         saving time, but leading to potential crashes. If 
         False, validation for finiteness will be performed, 
         avoiding error.  Global default: False. 
        working_memory : int, optional 
         If set, scikit-learn will attempt to limit the size of temporary arrays 
         to this number of MiB (per job when parallelised), often saving both 
         computation time and memory on expensive operations that can be 
         performed in chunks. Global default: 1024.
