The handling of boundary case in neghbors.*.radius_neighbors is not properly documented or tested: BallTree/KDTree appear to include the boundary (i.e. where the distance between the query and target is equal to the radius, the target is not returned), but the brute method in nearest neighbors does not. LSHForest includes the boundary due to this logic.
This should be consistent, tested and better documented.
