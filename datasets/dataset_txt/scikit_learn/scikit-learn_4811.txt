in k-fold cv, choosing n_folds=10 will train on 90% and test on 10% each time.
if you want the opposite behavior, i.e. train on 10% and test on 90%, you need to use LeavePOut with p=int(n*0.9).
i would like to suggest allowing to use instead p=0.9 to represent the fraction
this is similar to the test_size parameter in train_test_split which may take int or float
