see #12927 (and similar discussions over the last years).
I just noticed that because openml-python imports it and it breaks on master.
That makes it likely that other libraries also have imported it, so maybe we need to deprecate it - the newest version of openml fixed that but basically it shows it's a hassle for downstream packages.
