DummyClassifier currently offers the 'most_frequent' strategy to assign the most frequent label from training to every instance. In a binary classification task where the most frequent class is negative, and hence F-score is used, the 'most_frequent' strategy will always yield a recall of 0. A more useful baseline would always output the positive (or a given) label, producing a recall of 1.0 and a precision of n_positive / n_samples (and thus 0.0 < F1 < 0.67).
