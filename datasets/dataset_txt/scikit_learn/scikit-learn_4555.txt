I found a mistake in the plot_oneclass.py example for the one-class SVM.
The code generates 20 test samples X = 0.3 * np.random.randn(20, 2) and then generates two copies shifted over X_test = np.r_[X + 2, X - 2].
This results in a total of 40 test samples, however in the plotting section of the file, it says:
pl.xlabel(
    "error train: %d/200 ; errors novel regular: %d/20 ; "
    "errors novel abnormal: %d/20"
    % (n_error_train, n_error_test, n_error_outliers))
pl.show()
Where the errors novel regular: %d/20 should actually be errors novel regular: %d/40 to take into account the duplicated number of samples.
Otherwise you can plot something and have 37/20 be errors, which doesn't make sense.
