Intro
cross_val_predict is useful because it returns the predicted targets (opposed to cross_val_score) and hides the parallelization logic behind a simple interface. There should be a similar function for predicting the probability distribution (predict_proba) over classes.
Discussion
Would this be a welcomed new feature?
Should this feature be a flag for cross_val_predict (e.g. probability=True)?
Should cross_val_predict then return both the classes and probabilities? Or only probabilities?
Should this feature be its own function? e.g. cross_val_predict_proba
