When the feature matrix X passed to an SVC is sparse and the kernel is a callable, it never gets called. Instead, the SVM seems to just go ahead and make abysmally bad predictions, without an error or warning.
I'm not exactly sure how to fix this right now (tired and getting a bit lost in the code). What I would like is for SVC to store my sparse input matrix and call my kernel function with two sparse matrices.
