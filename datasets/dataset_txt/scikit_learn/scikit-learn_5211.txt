The docs for sklearn.manifold.Isomap say that the fit and fit_transform methods can take sparse matrices. But if you pass a sparse matrix (I've tried scipy.sparse.dok_matrix and scipy.sparse.csc_matrix) it throws a TypeError:
TypeError: A sparse matrix was passed, but dense data is required. Use X.todense() to convert to dense.
