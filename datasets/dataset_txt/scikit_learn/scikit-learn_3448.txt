there is mentioning of in
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html
but in
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeRegressor.html
so it is not clear if this estimators_ list of DecisionTreeRegressor may be used.
It does not work when I try it -> all trees give the same output!!!
when this option for RandomForestRegressor is ok
the code is from
http://blog.datadive.net/prediction-intervals-for-random-forests/
def simple_RF_preds_each_game_all_trees(model, X):
each_game_all_trees = []
for x in range(len(X)):
preds = []
for pred in model.estimators_:
preds.append(pred.predict(X[x])[0])
each_game_all_trees.append(preds)
return each_game_all_trees
    simple_RF_each_game_all_trees = simple_RF_preds_each_game_all_trees(model_RFR, past_matrix_RF) 
but the same code for ExtraTreeRegressor does not working
def simple_Extra_Trees_preds_each_game_all_trees(model, X):
each_game_all_trees = []
for x in range(len(X)):
preds = []
for pred in model.estimators_:
preds.append(pred.predict(X[x])[0])
each_game_all_trees.append(preds)
return each_game_all_trees
    simple_Extra_Trees_each_game_all_trees = simple_Extra_Trees_preds_each_game_all_trees(model_Extra_Trees, past_matrix_RF) 
actually code is not crushing , but gives wrong result : all tree give the same prediction for given same input for each tree.
