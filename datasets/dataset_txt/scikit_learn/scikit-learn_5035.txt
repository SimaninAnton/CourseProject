I am not sure what the root is but the following was reported on IRC and I could reproduce:
when doing a nested cross-validation with GridSearchCV and cross_val_score, there seem to be some parallelization issues.
There is a random error in GridSearchCV
Maybe this is joblib related?
Reproduce using
 for x in xrange(1000): GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(), param_grid=dict(C=[1, 10]), n_jobs=10,cv=10))
(X, y was iris for me)
I get [Parallel] Pool seems closed and
ValueError: generator already executing
The n_jobs parameter is higher than the number of cores. Should that in general be forbidden?
ping @GaelVaroquaux.
