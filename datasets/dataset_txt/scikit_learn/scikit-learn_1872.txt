 def transform(self, y): 
I believe that the use of np.intersect1d in LabelEncoder.transform is not needed. This happens in the check to see if y contains previously unseen labels. Instead of checking if the length of the intersection between classes and self.classes_ is less than the length of classes, why not just check if the length of classes is greater than self.classes_?
If you would like it, I would be happy to take care of the issue.
