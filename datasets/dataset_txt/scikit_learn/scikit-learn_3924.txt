I was about to do a pull request for the following subject but I then thought that it would be better to talk about it.
I am using Binarizer from preprocessing module.
Its working perfectly, but for my use I would like it to binarize with other label than 0 and 1 for my positive and negative classes.
Don't you think that it would be totally fine to make it able to do so ?
binarize(X, threshold=0.0, neg_label=0, pos_label=1, copy=True)
It would still have the same behaviour but allowing people to Binarize with threshold and choosing Label.
I know it's possible to choose label with LabelBinarizer or others, but the notion of threshold is there absent. I think scikit-learn is missing a method allowing both.
