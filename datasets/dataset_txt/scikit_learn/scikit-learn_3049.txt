While we have the ability to pass axis arguments for the functions in the preprocessing module like scale, is there any way to pass the same when building scalers using the classes like RobustScaler?
Currently the following is mentioned in the API docs but I didn't see an option to pass the same. It could be I am missing something obvious.
Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature (or each sample, depending on the axis argument) by computing the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Median and interquartile range are then stored to be used on later data using the transform method.
Any help would be appreciated!
