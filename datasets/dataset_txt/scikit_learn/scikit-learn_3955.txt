doing
X = np.random.normal(size=(10, 3))
y = X[:, 0]
CCA().fit(X, y)
breaks with a nan warning, because n_components=2 by default, and the relation of y and X is rank 1.
I suspect that putting a break here will mostly solve the issue, but I didn't have time to test it out. It seems that doesn't entirely suffice.
