Currently ColumnTransformer takes a list of transformers and the columns they apply to. Instead of each transformer, the user may specify 'keep' or 'drop'. For the remaining columns, remainder='keep' or remainder='drop' may be specified.
Why not also support remainder=MyTransformer()?
This would allow one to have something like make_column_transformer(([list of categorical features], OneHotEncoder()), remainder=StandardScaler())
