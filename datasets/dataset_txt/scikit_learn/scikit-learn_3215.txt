I tried to run the example from [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_vs_lda.html] and it doesn't seem to work.
The root cause seems to be the following:
from sklearn.utils.validation import check_arrays
ImportError: cannot import name check_arrays
After inspecting the code, it appears that indeed, check_arrays is missing from sklearn.utils.validation.
