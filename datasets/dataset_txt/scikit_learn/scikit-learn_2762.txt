Hi,
can you update T-SNE to involve this excellent paper of @yaolubrain:
http://yaolubrain.github.io/dosnes/
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01977v1.pdf
Mainly "just" 2 additional steps happened compared to normal T-SNE:
replacing the unitary matrix-wise sum constraint Sum_ij(Pij) = 1 in s-SNE with the doubly stochasticity constraint, i.e. Sum_i(Pij) = 1 and Sum_j(Pij) = 1 (page 2 in paper).
This happens with a simple iteration where the P value is divided by the sum of row and then with the sum of column (instead of the sum of the whole matrix), and repeated for 100 (or some number) times.
constrain the output to be on a sphere (see page 4 in paper, it's hard to copy here)
