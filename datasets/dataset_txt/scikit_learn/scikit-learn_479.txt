Recently there is an error with LGTM (for C++), that requires this fix in lgtm.yml:
extraction:
  cpp:
    before_index:
      - pip3 install numpy==1.16.3
      - pip3 install --no-deps scipy Cython
    index:
      build_command:
        - python3 setup.py build_ext -i
LGTM has not have any alerts for C++ and Javascript: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/alerts/?mode=list
Should we disable LGTM for C++ and Javascript? The closest instruction I found regarding disabling it is here.
