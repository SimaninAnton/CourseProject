When running ./configure in preparation to build, it fails saying
/opt/turicreate-master
linux_patch_sigfpe_handler
[[ linux-gnu == linux* ]]
targfile=deps/local/include/pyfpe.h
echo '#undef WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER'
cat - deps/local/include/pyfpe.h
cat: deps/local/include/pyfpe.h: No such file or directory
And higher up we see this has happened:
mkdir -p deps/local/lib
mkdir -p deps/local/include
pushd deps/local/include
/opt/turicreate-master/deps/local/include /opt/turicreate-master
++ ls '../../env/include/python2.7/'
ls: cannot access '../../env/include/python2.7/': No such file or directory
By that time the script has made .../deps/env/include and put a symlink in there to /usr/include/python3.6m called python3.6m but it needs to also create one to /usr/include/python2.7 called python2.7. Create that symlink by hand, go back up to the distribution root and do ./configure again and it will work. This is on Gentoo Linux and its order of preference for Python is currently 3.6, 3.4, 2.7, and 3,5
