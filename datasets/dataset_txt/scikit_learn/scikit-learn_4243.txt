If I try to run the "predict" method with a SVC classifier that hasn't been been fitted, then the program throws the following error:
... AttributeError: 'SVC' object has no attribute '_sparse'
It might make debugging easier if it returned a clearer message. Maybe something like:
... Warning: 'SVC' object has not been fitted.
