We are trying to run agglomerative clustering (Wards) on a range of cluster numbers (i.e. N=2-9) without having to rerun the tree for each individual value of N, by using the cache. In other words run fit over different values of N, without re-clustering every time. However, we are getting syntax errors and not able to call up the labels for any of the clusters stored in cache afterwards. Code looks something like:
(x = AgglomerativeClustering(memory="mycachedir", compute_full_tree=True) but (x.fit_predict(inputDF{2})) does not fit the syntax of the memory access command
We saw older solutions from 2016 that involved GridSearchCV posted on stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36490241/sklearn-agglomerative-clustering-dynamically-updating-the-number-of-clusters), but perhaps some of these functions have now been depracated. Anybody know the syntax for calling up labels from the cache in this scenario? Thanks
P.S. I'm a newbie so apologies in advance if I am not being clear.
