By default, Sphinx builds are incremental: If you've recently done a clean build of the docs, and then you modified just one of the sources, the next time you build, Sphinx will only build the pages that would be affected by your changes, instead of also rebuilding the pages that aren't affected.
In contrast, when a docs contributor who's recently done a clean build of scikit-learn's docs wants to contribute another small improvement to the docs, and then runs make html to preview their changes locally, they have to wait for longer than they should have to while a lot of unaffected content is processed.
