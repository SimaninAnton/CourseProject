I am working with a ~5M by 300k sparse (CSR) matrix, and want to run a GridSearchCV for the regularization parameter C of a l1 penalized logistic regression. When running the grid search, the processes are spawned, but then hang indefinitely, and the search never completes (or begins, for that matter).
Here is my code:
param_grid = {'C': [x * .1 for x in range(2, 8)]}
lr_model = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', fit_intercept=False)
logit_model = GridSearchCV(lr_model,
                                                param_grid,
                                                scoring=calibration_score,
                                                cv=3
                                               n_jobs=-1,
                                               verbose=True)

logit_model.fit(design_matrix, response)
