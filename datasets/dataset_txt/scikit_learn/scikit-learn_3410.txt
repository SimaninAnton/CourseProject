Hello,
I was testing LogisticRegressionCV on a dataset, and wanted the cross validation to run on a single core.
But It actually ran on all my cores ...
Here is the model I launched the "fit" method on :
LogisticRegressionCV(Cs=10, class_weight=None, cv=10, dual=False,
           fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1.0, max_iter=100,
           multi_class='ovr', n_jobs=1, penalty='l2', random_state=None,
           refit=True, scoring=None, solver='lbfgs', tol=0.0001, verbose=1)
If it's of any help, I'm on Ubuntu 14.04, with latest release of scikit-learn (0.17).
Do not hesitate to ask me some more details on my issue, if needed.
Thanks,
Btw : I don't think the error comes from joblib since, after that, I tried running a GridSearchCV with 1,2, and all cores, and it behaved normally...
