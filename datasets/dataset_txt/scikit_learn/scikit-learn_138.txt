Description
Trying to apply linear regression with 0 features raises an error instead of fitting the bias term.
This plays a role when for example we want to perform forward search variable selection. Here, the constant model (or in the classification case the majority class prediction) is the initial model to consider.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression as LR
dataset = load_boston()
X = dataset["data"]
Y = dataset["target"]
LR(fit_intercept=True).fit(X[:, []], Y)
Expected Results
Fitting the bias term only, resulting in a constant model.
Actual Results
ValueError: Found array with 0 feature(s) (shape=(506, 0)) while a minimum of 1 is required.
