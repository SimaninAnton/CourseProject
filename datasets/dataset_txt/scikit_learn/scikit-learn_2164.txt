I get many email requests on how to contribute to sklearn.
I think we should do something similar to http://scikit-learn.org/dev/faq.html#what-s-the-best-way-to-get-help-on-scikit-learn-usage
and point to the contribution docs. They are a little bit hidden (you need to click development and then contributing) and relatively long, so a link and a two sentence summary in the FAQ might be good.
