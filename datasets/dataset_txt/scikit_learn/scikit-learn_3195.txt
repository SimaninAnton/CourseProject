it's fairly straightforward to add a test to the Travis matrix to grab numpy wheels built numpy wheels (works for conda or pip installs).
so in pandas we r testing 2.7/3.5 against numpy master continuously
https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/ci/install-3.5_NUMPY_DEV.sh
Numpy just release a beta, and I don't think we tested against it.
We don't need to recompile scipy because of numpy ABI compatibility.
