From #5141/comment @ogrisel:
At some point it would be great to refactor the CIFAR / SVHN loaders as generic loaders to be part of sklearn.datasets.fetch_* but this can be done in a later PR.
Some well-known medium-size datasets not available in sklearn at the moment:
CIFAR 10/100: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
SVHN: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/
STL-10: http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/
