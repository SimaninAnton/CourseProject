After #1128 is merged, the following easy issues remain in RFECV:
the scores are stored in a dictionary, where a numpy vector would be more appropriate
the scores actually store losses, not scores. In sklearn speak, high scores are good.
For the second (=remaining one), I am not sure how to address. I think the best thing would be to actually use scores and store scores and add a score_func parameter.
That is an incompatible change though, as we'd keep the same name but change the meaning :(
