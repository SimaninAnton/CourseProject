Hi,
Apologies if this is not the correct way to ask a question, but I have asked the below question in the below link and was hoping someone here could explain how to interpret a tree output from the RandomForestClassifier as it doesn't look as clear cut as a tree from the DecisionTreeClassifier?

Thanks!
