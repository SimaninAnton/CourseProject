In another (closed) issue, someone pointed out that StratifiedShuffleSplit does not preserve the class populations. This is a pretty substantial bug IMHO.
The docstring (0.11) claims:
"This cross-validation object is a merge of StratifiedKFold and ShuffleSplit, which returns stratified randomized folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class."
However, the previous closed issue (#687) points out that
"Yes, StratifiedShuffleSplit is broken, as you proved to us. This implementation shouldn't be use."
I've opened a new issue for two reasons:
The broken class is still in the public release.
It was quite hard for me to learn about this bug--it was buried deep in a pull request. My hope is that opening this issue will make it easier to learn (e.g. on Google) about the issue.
