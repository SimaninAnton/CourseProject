As discussed in the website-redo PR](#2201), jQuery has been updated from the ancient 1.2 it was working on to 1.7.2, however moving any more recent than that creates problems with the collapsible table of contents on the UserGuide page.
It would be useful if somebody can figure out what problem is being caused by the change in the toggle() function in jQuery between version 1.7 and 1.8.
I'll tend to this at a later stage if nobody has time.
