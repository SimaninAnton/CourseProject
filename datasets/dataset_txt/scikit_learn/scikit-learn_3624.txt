For the class sklearn.decomposition.PCA, there is an attribute "explained_variance_ratio_ " which gives the percentages of the components.
In scientific publications, the percentages are often displayed along the axis, when the data are plotted.
Unfortunately, there isn't the same attribute for the sklearn.lda.LDA class, and I need them absolutely for a publication.
Is there a way to get them ?
Sincerely
