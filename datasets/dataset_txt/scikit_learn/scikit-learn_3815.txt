Our current installation instructions are really complicated, and I feel they don't need to be.
There are basically two kinds of users:
they use numpy/scipy/pandas and want sklearn
they are new to the scipy ecosystem
To 1) we can just tell pip install scikit-learn, while to 2) I would suggest to install anaconda.
The installation page even talks about how to build the windows installer exe. That should really be in the dev docs. I think compiling yourself should be left to expert users, and they can look into the dev docs if they really want.
