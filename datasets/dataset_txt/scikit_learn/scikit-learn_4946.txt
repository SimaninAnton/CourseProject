This is a tiny bug (and may just be a documentation issue), but the init on GradientBoostingRegressor is document to accept 'auto' as an acceptable parameter for max_features (which will set max_features = n_features).
Using 'auto' for max_features creates no error when creating an instance, but will fail when a fit is tried.
Recreating code below:
import sklearn.ensemble as sken
import numpy as np
Works
gb = sken.GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators = 10, max_features = None, verbose = 2)
x = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.rand(1000)
gb.fit(x, y)
Fails when fit called
gb = sken.GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators = 10, max_features = 'auto', verbose = 2)
x = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.rand(1000)
gb.fit(x, y)
