In liblinear-based classifiers, the solver is automatically selected depending on the parameter combination. However, some combinations are not possible (e.g. dual=True, penalty='l1') and the error message is not clear at all. It would be better to print a message along the lines of only dual=False is supported when penalty='l1'.
Don't have time to fix it right now, hence this report.
