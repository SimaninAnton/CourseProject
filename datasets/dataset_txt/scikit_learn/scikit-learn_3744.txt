I've been running some benchmarks of approximate nearest neighbor packages and LSHForest seems to perform very bad. See https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks
Compared to raw bruteforce it's not much faster but precision is less than 10% (whereas bruteforce is of course 100%)
There might be something wrong with my benchmark code but there might also be something weird going on with LSHForest.
