The documentation of linear_model.LassoCV.fit(X, Y) states that y may take shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets). However, passing a two dimensional y fails:
X = numpy.random.normal(size=(5,3))
Y = numpy.random.normal(size=(5,2))
clf = linear_model.LassoCV()
clf.fit(X,Y)
raises ValueError("Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)") during coordinate descent.
Other estimators (e.g. LassoLarsCV) are documented to only take one-dimensioal y.
Therefore, I assume the above exception is expected behavior and there is a mistake in the documentation?
Note that I'm using stable, but this issue seems to be present in the documentations of dev branch and older versions as well.
[edit] above also applies to ElasticNetCV.
