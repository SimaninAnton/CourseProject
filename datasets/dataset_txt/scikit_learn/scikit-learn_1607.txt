Follow-up of #10427 (comment)
There are some remaining occurences of imread/imresize in doc and examples:
‚ùØ git grep -P 'imread|imresize' | grep -v sklearn
doc/datasets/index.rst:* `scipy.misc.imread <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.
doc/datasets/index.rst:  misc.imread.html#scipy.misc.imread>`_ (requires the `Pillow
examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.py:# matplotlib.pyplot.imread.  Note that each image must have the same size. For these
examples/cluster/plot_face_segmentation.py:face = sp.misc.imresize(face, 0.10) / 255.
examples/cluster/plot_face_ward_segmentation.py:face = sp.misc.imresize(face, 0.10) / 255.
The pyplot.imread is fine. It's probably fine removing the mentions in index.rst and pointing to an alternative (maybe matplotlib.pyplot.imread?). For the examples, the simplest thing to do is to use sklearn.external._pilutil.imresize.
@jotasi since you worked on #10427, it would be great if you could tackle this one!
