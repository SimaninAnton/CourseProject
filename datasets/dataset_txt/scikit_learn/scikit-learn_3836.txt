When calling the cross_val_predict with an X parameter that is a list type, an AttributeError is raised on line 1209. This is because it is checking for the shape of the X parameter, but a list does not have the shape attribute.
The documentation says that this function supports lists so I am supposing that it isn't intended behavior. Commenting out that line also makes the rest of the function work perfectly fine.
Also not that the cross_val_score function, that takes the same arguments, works fine.
I can provide the dataset I used if necessary.
