Description
I know that I can use the transform() method to standarize a data set with removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, and then I can use the inverse_transform() method to map the data back. But I wonder how could I map the data with a lower dimension back. For example, I have a data set with m * n, and I encode it to m * k, where k is smaller than n. How could inverse transform m * k data?
---Update---
The detailed data processing is as follows:
Firstly, I use the fit_transform() method of StandardScaler to transform my data with removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
Then, I use autoencoder model to reduce the dimension of my data from 512 to 2. The problem is that I wonder if it is possible for me to inverse transform the data with dimension of 2?
