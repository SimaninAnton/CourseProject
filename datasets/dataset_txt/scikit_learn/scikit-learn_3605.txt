Now I implement a simple KNN which according to the tutorial in the Internet. However, when I tested on Iris, Digits datasets loaded from scikit-learn module, the accuracy of my versions are better though they took more time. Is it the KDTree or other distance algorithms have an effect on the accuracy? Thank you.
