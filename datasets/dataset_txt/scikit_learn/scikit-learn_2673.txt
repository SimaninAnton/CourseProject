Description
To activate the verbosity for the method fit of the class RFECV, you have to set the verbosity level to 2 (or more).
It would be more logical to just set it to 1 (or more) like it is in every other sklearn's cases.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV

rfecv = RFECV(GradientBoostingRegressor(max_features='sqrt'), cv=KFold(n_splits=3), verbose=1)
rfecv.fit(x_train, y_train)
At verbosity 1, nothing is printed on stdout.
Expected Results
The expected behavior should be:
0 => Nothing is printed.
n > 0 => Current state of RFECV is printed.
Actual Results
n < 2 => Nothing is printed.
n > 1 => Current state of RFECV is printed.

Proposed solution
At line 407 of rfe.py:
rfe = RFE(estimator=self.estimator,
                  n_features_to_select=n_features_to_select,
                  step=self.step, verbose=self.verbose)
