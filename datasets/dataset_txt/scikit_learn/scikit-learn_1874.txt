Hi guys,
when I calculate the roc_curve I get non-sensical values for the thresholds:
array([ 1.22917414, 1.05628407, 1.05582547, ..., -0.0984059 , -0.10057652, -0.27449924], dtype=float32)
This is not explained by the arbitrary upper bound threshold of max(y)+1 that is mentioned in the documentation (Link). Thankful for any hints!
EDIT
My classification model actually outputted scores higher than 1 and lower than 0.
