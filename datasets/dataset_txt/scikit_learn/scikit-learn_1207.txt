Description
The default option to handle multiclass classification is 'ovr' in SVC. However, it is mentioned in the documentation that multiclass classification is handled in a 'ovo' scheme.

 class SVC(BaseSVC): 
     """C-Support Vector Classification. 
        The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time complexity 
     is more than quadratic with the number of samples which makes it hard 
     to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples. 
        The multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-one scheme.

     decision_function_shape : 'ovo', 'ovr', default='ovr' 
         Whether to return a one-vs-rest ('ovr') decision function of shape 
         (n_samples, n_classes) as all other classifiers, or the original 
         one-vs-one ('ovo') decision function of libsvm which has shape 
         (n_samples, n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2). However, one-vs-one 
         ('ovo') is always used as multi-class strategy.
