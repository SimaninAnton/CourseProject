Description
In Section 4.3.1.2. Scaling sparse data the docs suggest to scale sparse data by using with_centering=False:
[...] scale and StandardScaler can accept scipy.sparse matrices as input,
as long as with_centering=False is explicitly passed to the constructor. 
However, this param is no longer available (the closest relevant discussion that I could find is in #2514, which was closed as merged in #4828 and #4125) and, naturally, trying to use it will result in a TypeError in StandardScaler's __init__().
What is the correct way to do this now? Is this with_mean=False? I can submit a fix for the docs once this is confirmed.
