When I installed the scikit-learn with: python setup.py install --home ~/python
The installation ended correctly but when I want to import svm (from scikits.learn import svm), I got a sgd_fast not a module name exception.
If I first build the scikit "inplace" (python setup.py build_ext --inplace) then python setup.py install --home ~/python, it was no problem with svm import.
Probably a bug with the copy of sgd_fast during installation.
