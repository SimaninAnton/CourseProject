The OMP implementation sklearn.linear_model.orthogonal_mp sometimes produces inconsistent results compared to a naive implementation of the algorithm.
The following code has a particular dictionary and signal where the naive implementation is able to estimate the right solution, but sklearn.linear_model.orthogonal_mp does not.
