Hello Developers,
I noticed that when reading the documentation for Spectral Clustering, the first sentence feels clunky:
Apply clustering to a projection to the normalized laplacian.
Should it instead read:
Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized laplacian.
Also should the last word of paragraph 2 be plane instead of plan?
This would be my first issue and I'd be willing to fix these ASAP. Additionally, I can also clean up some of the formatting (i.e.: When parameters are referenced they sometimes are not referenced like this, or misc. comma splices).
Just let me know if there's anywhere special I should look for formatting Documentation pull requests!
Thanks!
