A few tests and doctests are currently setting np.random.seed globally. Unless I'm missing something, we should avoid that as it has the potential to both
affect other tests (if those don't set the random seed explicitly
hurt reproducibility: e.g. tests that don't set a random_state may behave deterministically because of this when run as part of the full test suite (given that test order is deterministic now) but yield another result when run separately.
