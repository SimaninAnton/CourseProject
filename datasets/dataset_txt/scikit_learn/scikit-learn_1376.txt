Before I join the project, I think general examples (at the top of the gallery) contains simple examples for typical algorithms. But now I realize that it contains examples that are not classified. Maybe we can try to put some of these examples into existing sections and change general examples at the top to something like other modules (examples concerning other modules) at the bottom.
Btw, seems that we can have a new section for sklearn.impute.
Not a serious problem so please close if you think current version is OK.
