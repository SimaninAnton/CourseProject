Testing a good max_iter value for a SVC instance I got this message:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py:208: ConvergenceWarning: Solver terminated early (max_iter=5000). Consider pre-processing your data with StandardScalar or MinMaxScalar.
% self.max_iter, ConvergenceWarning)
I suppose it is wrong and it should be StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, right?
Just a detail.
Thanks for the good work.
Cheers,
Alex
