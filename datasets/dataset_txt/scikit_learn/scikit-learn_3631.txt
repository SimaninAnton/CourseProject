Context
preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures exists, but there is no function to produce sums and differences of features. This is a type of classical feature engineering, sometimes used.
Would this be a welcomed new functionality ?
Usage
Usage would be inspired by preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures() :
class sklearn.preprocessing.SumDiffFeatures(sum=True, diff=True, include_bias=True)
Generate sums and/or difference interaction features.
Generate a new feature matrix consisting of combinations of sums and differences of the features. For example, if an input sample is two dimensional and of the form [a, b], it will generate [1, a, b, a+b, a-b].
