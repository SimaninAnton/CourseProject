I'm implementing an adaptive SGD algorithm as in this paper, which suggests splitting data into training and validation, and alternate between SGD step for parameters and penalty parameter.

I noticed that an issue with creating two instances of "CSRDataset". Once the "validation_dataset" is created, the original "dataset" becomes destroyed. I've been playing with this for a while but don't have a fix around the problem. Can someone suggest a fix? Thank you very much!
dataset = CSRDataset(X.data, X.indptr, X.indices, y_i, sample_weight)
validation_dataset = CSRDataset(X_validation.data, X_validation.indptr, X_validation.indices, y_validation, sample_weight_validation)
