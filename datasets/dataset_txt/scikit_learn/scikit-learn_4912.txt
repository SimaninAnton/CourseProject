Many tests from test_metrics fails in Python 3.3.
I think some of them fails because of stdlib "random" module changes: given the same seed, random.shuffle produces different results in Python >= 3.3 and Python < 3.3, and test_metrics.make_prediction relies on random.seed(0) to get reproducible random.shuffle.
