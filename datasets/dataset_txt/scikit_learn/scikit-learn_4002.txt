To grid-search parameters of sub-estimators, Pipeline and FeatureUnion currently use a __ syntax and named sub-estimators.
BaggingClassifier and RFE however use an estimator_params parameter, that makes grid-searches relatively awkward. I suggest we change them to the pipeline behavior by overloading get_params (or refactoring get_params by defining a unified way to declare sub-estimators).
