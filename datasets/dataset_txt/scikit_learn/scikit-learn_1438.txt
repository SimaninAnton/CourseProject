Description
utils/validation.py check_array() ValueError message appears in scenarios where you use pandas series and can be misleading if you're not aware that array.reshape is referring to numpy.
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
Note that Pandas' Series.reshape() is deprecated (see here) and is being replaced by Series.values.reshape().
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Any function that uses utils/validation.py check_array().
Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35082140/preprocessing-in-scikit-learn-single-sample-depreciation-warning
Expected Results
Reshape your data either np.reshape(array(-1, 1)) if your data has a single feature or np.reshape(array(1, -1)) if it contains a single sample.
Alternatively:
Reshape your data either np.ndarray.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or np.ndarray.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
Actual Results
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
