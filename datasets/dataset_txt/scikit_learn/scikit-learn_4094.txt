In exact nearest neighbor search, when brute force method is used, it simply uses pairwise_distance with entire batch and the calculation is vectorized(Always in kneighbors and sometimes in radius_neighbors). Approximate neighbors with LSHForest does not have this advantage since for different queries, neighbors will be searched from different candidates in the input space. Therefore, even for batched queries, distance calculations have to be done in conventional loops. This issue affects any LSH based technique (not only LSH forest) since final distances are calculated only in set of selected candidates for each query. This is a bottleneck when using LSH techniques because most of the time for queries are spent on distance calculations, not candidate selections. Does anyone have suggestions tackle this problem?
