It would be really neat with the DatetimeIndex constructor took an argument "dayfirst" which would force it to interpret a date as DD-MM-YYYY or similar when presented with a sequence of strings.
What it should never do is assume different formats for different strings in the same sequence (the current behaviour):
If the string can be interpreted as a "month first" date, i.e. <= 12 it's parsed this way
Otherwise it's parse as a day first string
I.e. all strings in the sequence for which the day happens to be <= 12 are parsed as "month first" and the rest as "day first".
