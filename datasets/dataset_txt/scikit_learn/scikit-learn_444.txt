I want to show train_score on a sklearn.model_selection.cross-validation .
cv = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=0)
result = cross_validate(testmodel, X, y, cv=cv)
On scikit-learn '0.20.3', train_score was indicated in this result, but on '0.21.2', train_score was not indicated in this result with the same code (test_score only).
What should I do?
