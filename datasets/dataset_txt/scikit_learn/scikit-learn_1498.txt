Description
DecisionTreeClassifier builds overtly complicated trees (assuming splitter=’best’) as on the example below. The tree used as an example could be easily pruned to two decision nodes. Pruning wouldn't affect the results when using splitter=’best’, but would improve readability of the results (and possibly performance, since smaller number of decisions need to be made) to great extent.
Expected Results
The pruning could happen either automatically, on the stage of building the tree, or via external prune() function. I guess that someone could argue that setting the splitter argument should not affect how the tree is build and otherwise it could be seen as inconsistent behaviour, but this souldn't be a problem if it was properly documented.
