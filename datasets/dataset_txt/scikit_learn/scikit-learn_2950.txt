With the new GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV results_ attribute, we are able to easily return more information to users. As well as test scores, we should have an option to return training scores.
This supersedes the ancient implementation in #1742, where training time sensitivity to parameters is also discussed in an example. It would still be good to have an example.
