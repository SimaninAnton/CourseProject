I just learned a trick for feature sampling from extra trees, that we might want to implement. Instead of sampling a threshold uniformly, it is often better to sample a training sample and use its value as a threshold. This means the thresholds are sampled from the actual feature distribution and thresholds probably lie in dense regions.
