Description
The logistic regression penalization seem to be applied to both weights and intercept. While it is not really a bug per say, I think this behavior is really counter intuitive (and there is this post on stack overflow suggesting that this opinion is shared https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/302986/how-avoid-regularizing-intercept-in-scikits-logisticregression)
It would be good to either correct it or give it as an option to pass through the class.
If there is no plan to correct it, I suggest to maybe change a little bit the documentation. The equation shows that only the weights are regularized which is misleading:
