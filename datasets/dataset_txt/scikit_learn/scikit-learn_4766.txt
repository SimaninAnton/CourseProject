Hi
I'm trying to use the roc_curve function in metrics module. I'm trying to understand what is meant by 'confidence values' or 'binary decisions' as an input to the parameter 'y_score'. Can someone please explain with an example maybe ?
Thanks
Here's the documentation given in the function:
y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
class, confidence values, or binary decisions.
