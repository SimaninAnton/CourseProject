Description
For my downstream project, I'm testing my classifier with check_estimator, and would like to see which of its individual tests failed.
Doing so under nose works by using
for check in _yield_all_checks(name, estimator): yield check, name, my_estimator (and a separate call to the class-level checks), but py.test won't support yield-tests, and using _yield_all_checks to parameterize a test doesn't work because the function requires the estimator instance.
Therefore the request is to provide all checks from check_estimator as a (non-private) iterable, so they can be used separately.
I brought this up in #10728 first, errorneously.
