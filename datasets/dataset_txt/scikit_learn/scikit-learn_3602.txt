Similar to the preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures() preprocessor, it would be nice to have a simple lagged features preprocessor for use in pipelines.
It might also be nice to have a lagged window-average (average of last n steps).
Would something like this be useful in general in sklearn? I'm probably going to have to code one up for myself anyway, and can make a pull request, if it is.
