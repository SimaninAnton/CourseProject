This tutorial http://scikit-learn.github.com/scikit-learn-tutorial/ (source repo: http://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn-tutorial/ ) is getting old and not maintained to reflect the latest API.
Most of the first sections have already been reused in the astronomy tutorial (not yet merged either). Only the last section on text data remains as original content. Hence we should:
finish the merge of the astronomy tutorial (TODO: find the issue number)
integrate the last section on machine learning with text data into a new, stand alone tutorial section of the main scikit-learn documentation in the main repo.
update http://scikit-learn.github.com/scikit-learn-tutorial/ to point to the main documentation
