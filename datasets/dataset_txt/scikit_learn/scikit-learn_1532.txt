Hello i have a binary random forest classifier with sklearn. I have two questions (i looked into the code but i cant figure it out).
How are thresholds generated for precision-recall curve or ROC?
How can I place the classifier to work on a specific point in the ROC or precision-recall curve? This is not covered anywhere.
I use the confusion matrix that tells me that i have a nearly perfect classifier but the precision-recall curve is giving me poor results, how can I combine these two views of my classifier?
Thank you
