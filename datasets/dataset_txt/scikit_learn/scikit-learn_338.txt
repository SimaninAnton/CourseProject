The documentation says that precomputed kernels are supported in Nystroem, but in reality it does not seem to be the case: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/kernel_approximation.html
By default Nystroem uses the rbf kernel, but it can use any kernel function or a precomputed kernel matrix.
Example code:
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem
nys = Nystroem(kernel='precomputed')
nys.fit_transform(K)
Leads to KeyError: 'precomputed'
