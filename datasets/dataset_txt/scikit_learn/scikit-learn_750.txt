 X_k = X[start:stop, :n_informative]  # slice a view of the cluster 
    A = 2 * generator.rand(n_informative, n_informative) - 1 
 X_k[...] = np.dot(X_k, A)  # introduce random covariance 
    X_k += centroid  # shift the cluster to a vertex 
X_k should get reassigned to X at correct location, but it is not done and hence features are not interdependent.
