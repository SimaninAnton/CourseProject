Equations in doc strings can be written much more clearly using shpinx's :math: directive. The way equations look in the docs, for example here is not very readable. With the correct formatting the equations can be written to look like this.
I tried it for Lasso, similar improvements can be done in many other docstrings.
@amueller @MechCoder What do you think ?
