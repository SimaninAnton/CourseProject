I had an issue with underflow as explained
hmmlearn/hmmlearn#35
I have created a patch (relative to 98c6edf)
which can be found here:
https://github.com/georgid/scikit-learn/blob/master/underflow.patch
Anybody cares to add a fix for it in next release?
NOTE:
@superbobry has suggested some workaround hmmlearn/hmmlearn#35
