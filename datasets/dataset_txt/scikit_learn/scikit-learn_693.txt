I am using the sklearn.svm.SVC method and after training the model using the following code:
model_SVC = svm.SVC(random_state=1,kernel='rbf', gamma=1,probability=True)
I extract the dual_coef_ atribbutes:
model_SVC.dual_coef_
But I think that they do not represent Î± values (dual model), but w (weigths associated with each variable in the feature space). Could it be possible?
Thanks,
