We recently merged a discretizing transformer into the discrete branch (see diff between that branch and master). Before merging it into master, we'd like a compelling example for our example gallery showing an application of machine learning where discretized features are particularly useful.
To dear contributor: Make sure to submit a pull request to the discrete branch.
