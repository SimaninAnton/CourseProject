As a first step towards fixing the model persistence issue, I think it would be nice to add two methods to BaseEstimator:
get_fitted_params(self): return a dictionary of fitted params (as per our convention, params suffixed with _)
set_fitted_params(self, dict): reset the estimator parameters from the dictionary
The purpose of those two methods is to be able to separate implementation from data. Pickling the data dictionary should be much more robust than pickling the estimator.
