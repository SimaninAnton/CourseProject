On Circle, we get many warnings like:
/home/circleci/project/doc/modules/calibration.rst:: WARNING: image file not readable: modules/../auto_examples/calibration/images/sphx_glr_plot_calibration_curve_002.png
and
/home/circleci/project/doc/datasets/index.rst:: WARNING: Could not obtain image size. :scale: option is ignored.
I don't get these building the docs on my own machine. Are these warnings indicative of a solvable problem? Is there a way to suppress these warnings? Are we really ignoring :scale: in compiling the online docs?
