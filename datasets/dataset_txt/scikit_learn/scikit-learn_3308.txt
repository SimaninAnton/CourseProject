I am creating 3-D embeddings for a dissimilarity matrix, disMat, which is a symmetric 100x100 Numpy array. For every Manifold object other than TSNE and MDS, I get the following error:
ValueError: Invalid mode, expected 'c' or 'fortran', got fort
Code example:
se = manifold.SpectralEmbedding(n_components=3)
coords=se.fit(disMat).embedding_
Traceback:
