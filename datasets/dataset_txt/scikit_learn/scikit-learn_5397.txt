Recursive feature elimination (RFE) fits an estimator, removes the least important features, and then re-fits the estimator on the remaining features. This process could be sped up if information from the first fit could be used in the re-fit.
Some estimators supported by RFE have a warm_start option in their constructors. This allows information from previous runs to be used in the current fit.
Currently RFE does not perform the refitting of models in such a way that the warm_start option can be exploited. This ticket (based on discussion in the mailing list) proposes a change to RFE so that it exploits the warm_start option where possible to speed up the iterative model fitting at the heart of RFE.
