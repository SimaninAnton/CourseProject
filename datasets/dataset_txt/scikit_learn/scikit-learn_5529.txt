The covariance estimators such as sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance handle 1-d input in an inconsistent way: they assume a 1-d array is a list of univariate samples rather than a single, multivariate sample. Since this behavior is not documented, but makes the code harder to follow, I suggest we get rid of this feature.
