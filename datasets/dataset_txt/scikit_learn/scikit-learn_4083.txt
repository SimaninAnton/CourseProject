Recently, the field of l1-l2 optimization has generated a lot of interest, as there are many areas in machine learning that uses them.
For example, I am using SSF and GPSR algorithm to get a sparse solution to LASSO problem for my dissertation in Face Recognition, and these algorithm turns out to be very efficient to solve large scale problem.Though we have LASSO in scikit-learn, I feel we can incorporate some more good algorithms like above which will give users more power.
