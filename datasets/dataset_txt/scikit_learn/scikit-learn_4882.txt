I get a ValueError when I try to train an SGDClassifier on a dataset with only positive examples. Given that the SGDClassifier is regularized, it should be possible to train this classifer â€” it has a well-defined solution. Is there a reason why this value error is raised, besides catching user errors?

    raise ValueError("The number of class labels must be "
ValueError: The number of class labels must be greater than one.
My use-case is that I would like to do inlier detection with a logisitic loss function. I expect the solution to be the minimum norm solution that separates the instances from the origin.
