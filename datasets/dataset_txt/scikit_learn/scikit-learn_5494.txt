Update:
I think most people agree now. The estimators should call unique from the utilities (which is a backport of numpy.unique) and save the results in a classes_ attribute.
You can look at QDA and LDA for the pattern.
To find classes that not yet support this, use the test_common.py.
Just comment out this line in test_classifiers_classes.
Once that works, we can use the text of the classes as labels and see where it breaks next ;)
If anyone decides to work on this, have a look at my branch here where I started work.
