Transformers have y=None for Pipeline compatibility. #9578 has added documentation for some of them to make clear that y is ignored in .fit.
@jnothman remark seems to indicate that the same could be done in sklearn.cluster
in #9578 (review).
Potentially it would be good to find most transformers with missing documentation for y=None. git grep could help.
