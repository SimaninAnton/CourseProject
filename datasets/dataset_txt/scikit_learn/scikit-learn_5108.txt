Hello,
In the documentation for the one versus one heuristic on multiclass classification, it is written "At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected." The predict_ovo def returns the argmax of the votes matrix. My intuition is that in cases of ties, the vote will be biased towards the classes from the first binary classifiers because argmax selects automatically the first occurrence in cases of ties.
I wondered if it would be possible to implement a classification strategy less biased, such as selecting the classifier which has the highest output function as is done by the one vs. the rest heuristic if I am not mistaken.
Thank you for your help.
