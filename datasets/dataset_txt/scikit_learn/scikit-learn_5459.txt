I just noticed that the NearestNeighbors class has neither a transform nor a predict method.
This seems like an API break to me.
It has kneighbors and epsilon_neighbors (and graph functions).
I feel it would be more consistent to have a single function for both k and epsilon and have an additional argument.
I would prefer the method that returns the nearest neighbors to a point to be the predict method, which
would be consistent (in some way) with the kmeans API.
