Affinity propagation do not handle identity matrix correctly:
In [81]: s = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
In [82]: affinity_propagation(s, verbose=True)
Did not converged
Out[82]:
(None, array([[ nan],
[ nan]]))
When type of s is float, ap converged. Thus the reason might be the numerical computation consistency.
BTW, it seems there are two ways to report bugs, sf and github. Do you have any preference?
