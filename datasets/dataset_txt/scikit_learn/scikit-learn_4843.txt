Currently the hamming loss is not in the SCORERS dict. I don't see a reason why we should leave any scores (for the moment: that return a single value) out of the dict (so we should probably also add JaccardIndex and maybe some others?)
There is also no default implementation of score for the OneVsRestClassifier and OneVsAllClassifier in the multi-label case. I think the main reason was that we didn't have the hamming loss (or any other multi-label loss) when these were implemented. We should definitely add a default implementation, and I'd vote for the hamming loss.
Currently grid-searching multi-label problems is a bit inconvenient because of the above two issues.
