I am writing a text classification algorithm that uses an SVM based on tree kernels. I have the following code:
    for tree_kernel in 'ptk', 'sptk', 'csptk':
        kernel = TweetKernel(tree_kernel=tree_kernel)
        svc = SVC(kernel=kernel)
        svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
where X_train contains some text columns. Unfortunately this is erroring out at the following line:
scikit-learn/sklearn/svm/base.py
Line 147 in 49da6c8
 X, y = check_X_y(X, y, dtype=np.float64, order='C', accept_sparse='csr') 
Please fix so that if a callable is passed for the kernel argument, this restriction is not enforced.
