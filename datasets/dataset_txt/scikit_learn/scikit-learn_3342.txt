For outlier detection, I am using the EllipticalEnvelope approach. I have noticed however, I often get the following error message:
sklearn/covariance/robust_covariance.py:161: RuntimeWarning: Warning! det > previous_det (-13.868172040727313 > -inf)
% (det, previous_det), RuntimeWarning)
I have tracked this down (well, the -inf case) to be resulting from the use of fast_logdet in _c_step (in robust_covariance). It might just be a misunderstanding on my part, but since a covariance can be negative, taking the log of it will result in -inf -- thus creating this problem.
