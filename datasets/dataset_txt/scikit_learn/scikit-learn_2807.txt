Description
(Motivated by some questions in the mailing list)
I couldn't find a place where the attributes of the underlying tree_ objects of DecisionTree<Classifier/Regressor> were documented. They're fairly useful for getting basic information about a built tree, and many people don't know where to look in the code base to find info about them (here in _tree.pyx).
Is it worth linking to the file or having a page that documents all the properties?
