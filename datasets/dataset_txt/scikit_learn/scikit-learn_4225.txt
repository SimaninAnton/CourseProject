I have been working on making the output of tree.export_graphviz more aesthetically pleasing as inspired by fancyRpartPlot in R. Colour brewing is done manually so the only additional import required is numpy, and output is still pure dot format.
Enhancements include:
Drawing leaf nodes at the base of the tree for clarity
Colours indicating how the node classification is 'leaning' (multi-class colours are already supported but the alpha logic needs more work)
Percentage samples shown in node instead of raw number of samples
Percentage per class shown for all nodes, not just leaves
Some examples using the titanic survivor dataset:

With new simple=True argument:
If this is of any interest as a pull request, I will continue working on it. Welcome any suggestions / gotchas.
