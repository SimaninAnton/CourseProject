RFE gets an estimator as a constructor argument.
It stores this estimator, not a clone, and then fits this estimator. This is not how we do this in other places, right?
It this desired behavior? I feel this is a weird side-effect.
todo:
Clone the estimator in the beginning or RFE and RFECV, add a test that ensures that RFE doesn't modify the estimator it gets.
