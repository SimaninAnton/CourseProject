The docs on the Calinski-Harabaz Index should mention that it's also known as variance ratio criterion.
Matlab only calls it Calinski-Harabaz:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/clustering.evaluation.calinskiharabaszevaluation-class.html?requestedDomain=true
This R-package only calls it Calinski-Harabaz:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clusterCrit/vignettes/clusterCrit.pdf
This book:
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-53965-7_9
calls is "Variance Ratio Criterion (by Calinski-Harabaz).
The original paper (feast your eyes on hand-written formulas https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233096619_A_Dendrite_Method_for_Cluster_Analysis)
calls it VRC.
I guess mentioning VRC won't hurt in the end.
