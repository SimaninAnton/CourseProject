I am using scikit-learn 0.14 (I unintentionally got the development branch). The classifiers themselves take strings as classes, but it seems the scorers in sklearn.metrics do not.
After I train and test my classifier, when I go to get metrics:
metrics.classification_report(ytest, ypred)
My error is:
File "/usr/local/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/metrics.py", line
2083, in classification_report
target_names = ['%d' % l for l in labels]
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not numpy.string_
The same error occurs for metrics.precision_score(ytest, ypred). However, this error does NOT occur for metrics.accuracy_score or metrics.confusion_matrix.
