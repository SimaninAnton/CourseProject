Using RandomForestClassifier with some very large data and parallelization, I encountered:
SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
I'm fairly sure it's this issue http://bugs.python.org/issue17560 which the joblib maintainer claims to have addressed: http://bugs.python.org/issue17560#msg195647
I see that the joblib version in the externals in sklearn include the fix, but there hasn't been a release yet.
So, I guess I'm requesting that be incorporated into a release.
