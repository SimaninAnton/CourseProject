StratifiedKFold input validation checks that:
"The least populated class in y has only x members, which is too few. The minimum number of labels for any class cannot be less than k".
Is there any strong reason for this restriction?
I expect the following case to be handled:
from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedKFold
y = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]

for train, test in StratifiedKFold(y, k=2):
    print train, test
