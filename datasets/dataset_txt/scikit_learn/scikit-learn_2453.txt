I think this example:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/exercises/plot_cv_diabetes.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-exercises-plot-cv-diabetes-py

We could set refit=False - or not.
(also I feel like we might want to create a helper for the fill-between stuff in the plot module - maybe that's the 1d special case of visualizing grid-search)
