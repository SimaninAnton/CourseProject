The current implementation of semi-supervised classifier in label_propagation.py assumes that label for unlabeled data is -1 and they are mixed together with labeled data.
If Cross-Validation is used for this classifier, the kfold will also split the whole data set, thus also split unlabeled data. This will cause problem because the hold-out data include unlabeled data, whose labels do not make sense for scoring.
Let me know if I understand correctly about this issue.
