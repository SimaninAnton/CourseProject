When IterGrid generates only one grid point (each parameter has only one possible value), we could bypass the cross-validation and fit the estimator normally with this one parameter combination. I have code which depending on the case has only one grid point or several grid points and I would like the former to be handled efficiently.
If other people agree, I can fix this.
