Hi, while testing ROC-curve I noticed that in some situations output of roc_curve is longer than input (exactly +1 element).
Why/when this is needed?
BTW. I found this while testing pure numpy implementation of ROC curve (if set size=10, test will fail due to this moment in implementation) https://arogozhnikov.github.io/2015/09/29/NumpyTipsAndTricks1.html#Computing-ROC-curve
