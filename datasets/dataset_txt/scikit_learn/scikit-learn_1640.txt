Description
I am not sure if it's intended for MultiLabelBinarizer to fit and transform only seen data or not.
However, there are many times that it is not possible/not in our interest to know all of the classes that we're fitting at training time.
For convenience, I am wondering if there should be another parameter that allows us to ignore the unseen classes by just setting them to 0?
Proposed Modification
Example:
from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer
mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer(ignore_unseen=True)

y_train = [['a'],['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
mlb.fit(y_train)

y_test = [['a'],['b'],['d']]
mlb.transform(y_test)
Result:
array([[1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0]])
(the current version 0.19.0 would say KeyError: 'd')
I can open a PR for this if this is a desired behavior.
