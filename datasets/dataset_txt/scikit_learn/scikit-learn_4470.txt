The method metrics.precision_recall_curve has a parameter that can be used to define the label of the positive class. This parameter is, however, never used which result in wrong values of precision and recall.
The problem can be fixed by changing the line 273 of metrics/metrics.py from
fps, tps, thresholds = _binary_clf_curve(y_true, probas_pred)
to
fps, tps, thresholds = _binary_clf_curve(y_true, probas_pred, pos_label)
The documentation of the method should also be changed to include the description of the parameter.
