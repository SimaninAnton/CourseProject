Description
Is it possible to adopt OneVsRestClassifier to accept multioutput-continuous as target value?
My training sample has a [n_samples x n_classes] matrix as y and each sample's label is a continuous probability distribution over all labels.
Currently the LabelBinarizer doesn't accept such data and even if the data is passed as a csc_matrix the check_classification_targets in sklearn.utils.multiclass raises and error if the values are not 0/1.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
clf=OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression())
#the following function is just a mock function but it creates a multioutput-continous target value Y so that each row is a probability distribution over all labels.
X, Y = get_multioutput_continuous_data()
clf.fit(X, Y)
