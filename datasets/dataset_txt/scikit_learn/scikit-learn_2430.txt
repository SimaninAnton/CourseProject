Hi,
u use sklearn for my malware detection framework. i have satisfied dependencies ( numpy and scipy) and my sklearn is latest version( which includes MLP). i use neural networks in my framework and the language is python.
i get this error when i try to run my database training script. i should add that i didnt get this error previously and its happening after i moved to mint serena (OS). same error i get in windows after i install anaconda. after i stop the script, this is the log:
Are you sure y is categorical? It has more than 5 levels.
