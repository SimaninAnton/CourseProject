The SVD solver warns on collinear data:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/discriminant_analysis.py#L387
That was introduced by @agramfort about 10 years ago:

I don't think it's actually helpful. We don't raise this warning anywhere else, not even in LinearRegression.
