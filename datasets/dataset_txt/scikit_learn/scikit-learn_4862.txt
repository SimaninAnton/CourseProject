As @larsmans observed, KernelPCA doesn't abide by its n_components parameter.
He introduced a new parameter remove_zero_eig in #1758 to control removal of empty components with default=True
Maybe we should aim at changing the default in the future for more expected results?
In the meantime, I'll push a quick fix for the common tests to set the parameter there.
