How would you welcome the addition of a OneFoldCV splitter that would basically be train_test_split wrapped as a CV iterator? This way it could be used in GridSearch etc.
There are ways to achieve this already (e.g. PredefinedSplit) but this is a bit cumbersome and it's not explicitly documented.
I feel like this kind of splitter may be useful when you have lots of data, or e.g. in Successive Halving #13900 (dask does it this way at least).
