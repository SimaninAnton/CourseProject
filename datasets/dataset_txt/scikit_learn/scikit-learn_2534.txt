Hi everyone, I just wanted to ask a question regarding multiprocessing i.e. utilizing all cores. I've noticed that only particular methods allow the usage of n_jobs=-1. For instance, SVC doesn't provide n_jobs=-1 as an option at all. I was wondering why is that? Is it something by design or simply it has not been introduced to all methods yet?
