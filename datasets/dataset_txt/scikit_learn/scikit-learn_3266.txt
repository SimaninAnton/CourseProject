I have a test of a couple of clustering methods which should produce the same results. In practice they do, but the test is failing because, although the clusters produced are identical (same number of clusters, same sets of points clustered together), the estimator.labels_ have different index numbers for the clusters.
Example:
estimator1.labels_ = [1 1 0 0 2 1 0]

estimator2.labels_ = [2 2 1 1 0 2 1]
Is there any built-in test for this situation where there is a 1:1 mapping between cluster labels? And if not, would one be useful?
