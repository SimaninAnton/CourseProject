This discussion bring some insights about adding a multivariate imputer in scikit-learn. Because of release time constraint, the development was moved into a specific branch (FIXME: give a specific name) see #11600.
Decide good default for the IterativeImputer/ChaindedImputer (#11350).
Modify the example for imputation to show a compelling example (#11350).
Add an example to illustrate how to make multiple imputation (#11370).
Add a meta-estimator which does multiple imputations?
