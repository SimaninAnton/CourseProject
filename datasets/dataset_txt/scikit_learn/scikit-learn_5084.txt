Currently the tree estimators in sklearn.ensemble use an unusual check_input argument in the .fit method to get of some input checking.
This has been introduced to improve argument checking without decreasing performance of ensemble estimator: if n_estimators > 1, there would be redundant input checking. However, this effect hasn't been measured through benchmarks.
If benchmarks show that this argument is crucial for speed performance, this should be switched as an argument of sklearn.tree.BaseDecisionTree. Note this means that several estimators in sklearn.ensemble should also be modified consistently.
If it is not, this parameter should be removed.
This was brought into consideration in #1388.
