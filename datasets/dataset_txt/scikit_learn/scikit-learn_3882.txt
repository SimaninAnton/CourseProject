when the SVC with default rbf kernel was used on the included digits datasets, the classifier produced unusually high error rate. when switched with a different kernel, the problem went away. what's more interesting is that classifier always mislabels with the same number, which can be easily observed in the confusion matrix below.
I am on version 0.16.1
