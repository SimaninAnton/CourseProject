If the "residual_threshold" argument in RANSACRegressor is set to zero, the regression will almost certainly fail. However, figuring out what is going on based on the error messages is not obvious:
ValueError: Found array with 0 sample(s) (shape=(0, 1)) while a minimum of 1 is required.
(I believe that when residual_threshold==0.0, one of the cross-validation classes is empty, and things break.)
Because (I think?) there is no legitimate reason to set residual_threshold==0.0, and to save some future soul the debugging journey I just went through, it might be helpful to throw an exception (or at least a clear warning) if residual_threshold==0.0.
