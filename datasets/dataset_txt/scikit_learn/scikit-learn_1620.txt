Description
I have encountered a bug. When I run my code which uses sklearn for randomized params search it causes creating enormous amohnt of python processes. There may be a recursion or an infinity loop skmewhere. I couldn't reproduce that on test suite.
The OS is Windows 7, the distribution is Anaconda, scikit-learn is installed from conda.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
1 clone https://github.com/KOLANICH/HDDModelDecoder, https://github.com/KOLANICH/Chassis.py, https://github.com/KOLANICH/AutoXGBoost.py
2 copy the files Chassis.py/Chassis.py AutoXGBoost.py/AutoXGBoost.py to HDDModelDecoder/learn
3 comment out in AutoXGBoost.py everything related to the packages you don't have (i.e. hyperopt-related) and add method="RandomizedSearchCV" to the line 57 of learnWDSeries.py
4 open any tool allowing to view processes trees, for example Microsoft Sysinternals Process Explorer
5 cd HDDModelDecoder/learn
6 python ./learnWDSeries.py
7 see enormous amount of processes being spawned and system going unresponsive. Kill the tree while ou still can.
Expected Results
It shouldn't act as a fork bomb
Actual Results
Many processes, OS goes unresponsive and HDD goes very active. I have tried different values of n_jobs: 1, 0 . The result is the same.
