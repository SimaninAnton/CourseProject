Description
I pickled an estimator with sklearn 0.22.0 and I'm trying to unpickle it with 0.22.1.
Expected Results
No warning since this is a patch version change, there should be no breaking changes.
Actual Results
I got the following warning:
UserWarning: Trying to unpickle estimator MinMaxScaler from version 0.22 when using version 0.22.1. This might lead to breaking code or invalid results. Use at your own risk.
