On my machine, gen_rst.py throws a UnicodeDecodeError when creating the permalink headers (the paragraph symbol on the right-hand-side of the title).
here is a trace::
Exception occurred:
  File "/home/pprett/workspace/scikit-learn/doc/sphinxext/gen_rst.py", line 882, in embed_code_links
line = line.replace(name, link)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 232: ordinal not in range(128)
Maybe its a particular issue of my machine (haven't fiddled with sitecustomized.py though).
Would be great if someone could run make clean html and check whether it works.
thanks
