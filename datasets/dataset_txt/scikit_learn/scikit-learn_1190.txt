Hello,
First, great job with scikit-learn! it's the first time that I report an issue regarding scikit so I do not know if I'm entitled to do that and if it is the right place.
The issue seems relatively simple: the predictmethod of the BayesianRidgeestimator as a keyword argument return_stdallowing to predict not only the mean but also the standard deviation of the posterior distribution. When using the BayesianRidge estimator in a Pipeline, however, the Pipeline.predict method does not allow to transfer the return_std argument to the BayesianRidge.predict method.
Would it be possible to add a return_std optional argument to the Pipeline.predict method and to return the tuple (y_mean, y_std) rather than y_mean alone?
