Considering that predict, predict_proba and predict_log_proba accomplish very similar thing, wouldn't it be more logical to have a single predict method which would take an optional parameter type (or maybe some other name, such as output)? This would also allow for a more easy addition of alternative outputs where it makes sense (e.g. raw score before logistic transformation, like xgboost does with objective binary:logitraw).
So for example predict(X) would do the same thing as it does now for regressors and classifiers, but predict(X, type='proba') for classifiers would do the same thing as predict_proba does now.
