I am studying Machine Learning via scikitlearn, and since the docs are fabulous, I am reading them. but when I go to the tutorials, I don't have a next button, if we have a next button, we would be able to go to the next topic, I have to either open a new tab all the time or go back to the menu page and go to the next topic.
Also the PDF export is broken, unable to download PDF file.
