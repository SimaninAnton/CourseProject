I have data set in csv file and I want to load it into Scikit-Learn. Here are general information with part of the dataset:
File name:mobile
11 attribute(rows)
4 columns with the predicted class (target variable)
target variable:decision
age mobile type color decision
22 iphone black buy
44 samsung gray not buy
44 samsung gray not buy
What is the exact code do loading this file into Scikit-Learn?
One more thing, is there any file format better that csv (might be loaded easier)?
Thanks
