Description
Some classifiers and regressors support multi-output, however we do not have a common test for that. We should add it. See discussion in #11458.
We should also remember to remove redundant individual tests introduced by 95993a4.
Example of code for individual test
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn import datasets

X, y = datasets.make_multilabel_classification(n_classes=3)

# Test multi-output classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y.astype(str)).predict(X)

# Test multi-output regressor
rfr = RandomForestRegressor()
rfr.fit(X, y).predict(X)[:3]
Expected Results
No error is thrown for these checks. Some regressors and classifiers are omitted from this check.
