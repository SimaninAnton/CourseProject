Currently it's really hard to understand tree-based models imho.
If I train a random forest with default parameters, I might want to know how deep it is or how many leaves it has so that I know how to prune it. That's pretty tricky to do, given that these are very fundamental properties of the model. Do you think these would be helpful to make more accessible?
