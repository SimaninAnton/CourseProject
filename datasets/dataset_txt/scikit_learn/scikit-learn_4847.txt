svm.SVC documentation states that the "degree" parameter is significant for the sigmoid kernel. Also, it says that "gamma" is a coefficient for the polynomial kernel (and not the sigmoid kernel)
However, "gamma" is used as a coefficient for the sigmoid kernel, and "degree" is not relevant for this kernel. Also, "gamma" is not related to the polynomial kernel.
A quick check on the source code in metrics/pairwise.py confirms :
kernel_params = {
...
"rbf": set(("gamma",)),
"sigmoid": set(("gamma", "coef0")),
"polynomial": set(("gamma", "degree", "coef0")),
...
}
Thanks!
