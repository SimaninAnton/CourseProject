Hi, I am running my own dataset with scikit-learn. My dataset contains '2016/02/28', '20:12:22', '100' and 'string', Date, time, integer and string.
I have successfully parsed the data with Pandas and have reached CLF using SVM to test out.
However, upon clf.fit(X, y), an error was returned ValueError: invalid literal for float(): 25:13:15, apparently in my dataset, there is a time of 25:13:15 which reflect 02:13:15am.
Please advise how should I go about fixing this issue.
Thank you.
