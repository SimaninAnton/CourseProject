Description
When importing KDTree from the sklearn.neighbors module, if there is a file named code.py in the path, it will be imported. This is an erroneous import. Somewhere in sklearn, something must be importing code without specifying the correct path. I could not find it when scanning through the GitHub.
This could be a potential security hazard!
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Paste the following snipped into a file named code.py
print("Hello world!")
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree
print("Goodbye.")
Now in a shell, execute the python program (with sklearn installed) python code.py.
Expected Results
$ python code.py
Hello world!
Goodbye.
$
Actual Results
$ python code.py
Hello world!
Hello world!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
