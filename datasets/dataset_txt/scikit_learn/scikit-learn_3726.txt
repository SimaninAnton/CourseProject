The docs advertise that cluster_std can be a sequence of floats, but this does not work.
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
X, y = make_blobs(centers=3, cluster_std=[1.0, 2.0, 5.0])
results in
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 2, in <module>
    X, y = make_blobs(centers=3, cluster_std=[1.0, 2.0, 5.0])

I should have a PR for this soon.
