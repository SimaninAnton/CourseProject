The Ward clusterer is accompanied by WardAgglomeration, which reduces the feature space by pooling (e.g. mean, max, pca) the values of those that are close in the sample space.
The implementation only involves fitting on X.T rather than X, and inheriting from AgglomerationTransform to provide transform and inverse_transform methods (though the pooling_func argument to transform should probably be an estimator-level property).
It would seem sensible to provide equivalent agglomeration functionality for other clusterers. (It could be implemented as a meta-estimator, but scikit-learn may want to keep the API simpler.)
