Although the gallery in #2017 works well, if one, for some reason swooshes the mouse pointer about in a crazy fashion over the gallery items, it can sometimes happen that one or two stay open, which goes away once moused over and off again. It's nothing serious and doesn't break or impede the functionality of the gallery, however, this can be avoided with something like jQuery's hoverIntent. I'm not saying that is exactly what will fix it, but it's more of just a reference for what needs to be done.
In a nut-shell, the thumbnail should only expand due to mouseover when the mouse has stopped on top of it.
I'll look into this a bit later if nobody spots and does a nice solution in the meanwhile
