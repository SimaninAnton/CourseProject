text_clf = Pipeline([('vect',CountVectorizer(decode_error='ignore')),
                      ('tfidf',TfidfTransformer()),
                      ('clf',label_propagation.LabelSpreading(gamma=0.25, max_iter=5))])
If the label_propagation.LabelSpreading is replaced by SVC or others, it does't yield any errors.
Any opinions would be appreciated!
