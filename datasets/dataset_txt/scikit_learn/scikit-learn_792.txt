Hey all.
MS volunteered to help us set up Azure pipelines for CI. I'm not sure if @ogrisel or anyone else has looked into them yet. One of the benefits would be potentially arbitrary many builds in parallel if we ask nicely.
@njsmith had mentioned on twitter it's slower than travis but that might be fixed by now?
I'm swamped with other stuff so I have no cycles for this. I'll point Mickey Gousset who volunteered to help to this issue to discuss.
