While trying to install scikit-learn on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine I am getting the following error. I have installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the documentation. Seems like there is a 32-bit /64-bit library conflict. Could you please help me resolve this issue? Here's the output -
naved@neo:~/softwares/scikit-learn-0.14.1$ python setup.py install --user
Partial import of sklearn during the build process.

Thanks in advance
