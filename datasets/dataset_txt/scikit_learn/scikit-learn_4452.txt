When fitting a very large array I get the error in the title. The shape of the array is (222000, 118507). The code that causes this is
PAC = PassiveAggressiveClassifier(n_iter=50,n_jobs=-1,C=0.5)
PAC.fit(xtrain,ytrain)

Exception in thread Thread-2:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python27\lib\threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "C:\Python27\lib\threading.py", line 763, in run
    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\multiprocessing\pool.py", line 342, in _handle_tasks
    put(task)
SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
How do I resolve this? Not sure if it is related to this:
