The test failure in https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/459659290 is because the test_shuffle_kfold_stratifiedkfold_reproducibility test seems to assume that two shuffles of some data must be very distinct.
While the point is to test the behaviour where random_state=None, we should probably make it harder for this test to fail, for instance by checking that at least some test set is different, rather than the current code which checks that all test sets are different.
