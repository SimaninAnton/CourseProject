Hi, this it my first bug report, so I'm not exactly sure how much information is usually required here.
I've run the MeanShift algorithm on a cluster of approximately ~300,000 in size. It gives me an output of:
 [user@host ~]$ python meanshifttest.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "meanshifttest.py", line 13, in <module>
    ms = MeanShift().fit(X)

I was encouraged to file a bug report from my stackoverflow question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20104999/python-meanshift-memory-error/20116682?noredirect=1#comment30125531_20116682).
