LinearSVC and SVC's predict and decision_function could easily be implemented in pure python.
Advantages:
Reduce binding size
Avoid the creation of liblinear and libsvm's internal models from numpy arrays / sparse matrices at each call
Disadvantage:
Less memory efficient if predict is implemented as the argmax of decision_function
This should also solve the problem that decision_function is not implemented in sparse.SVC.
In any case, we should probably do a little benchmark to make sure we don't loose too much in runtime speed.
