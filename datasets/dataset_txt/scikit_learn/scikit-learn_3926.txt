Pipeline.named_steps is not documented, and there is no example of using either named_steps or steps to access any attributes of the estimator.
That question comes up pretty frequently.
named_steps is weird as it is initialized in __init__ and doesn't have a trailing underscore.
Maybe the real fix is #1769, but for the moment we should just document better, I think.
