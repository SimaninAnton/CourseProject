Just a question understanding Multinomial Logistic Regression in sklearn. When i read how multinomial regression is performed in wikipedia, i saw it runs k-1 against the pivot class(base class) binary classifiers where k is number of classes. But while using sklearn implementation of multinomial logistic regression when i try to print coef_ for classifier, i get n coefficient vector instead of n-1 coefficient vector. I am just trying to interpret the coefficient, so want to know what is the model printing ?
