It seems to me that the fit_intercept and normalize arguments in Ridge constructor is ultimately passed to linear_model.base.center_data, which does no normalization if fit_intercept is false. Is that intended? I can see cases where it is desirable not to fit intercept, but to normalize the features to be on the same scale before fitting ridge.
Also, this effect of fit_intercept has on normalize is not clear from the documentation of linear_model.ridge.Ridge.
