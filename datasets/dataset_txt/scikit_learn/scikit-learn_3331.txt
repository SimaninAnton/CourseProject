I'd like to run GridSearch optimizing for area under the precision/recall curve. It's great that "roc_auc" is readily available, but I'd like to be able to optimize for "pr_auc" too. See http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jdavis/davisgoadrichcamera2.pdf for a discussion of the meaningful differences between PR_AUC and ROC_AUC.
See also precision_recall_curve() and auc().
