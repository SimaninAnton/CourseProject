I was just talking to Ryan from mlpack. He did a benchmark of some nearest neighbors implementation.
When he used sklearn he had a hard time figuring out how to use a particular method for fitting and just get the nearest neighbors for a given set.
I looked at the docs and it is not so obvious to me. it seem you have to construct a tree and then feed it to kneighbors_graph or use NearestNeighbors and then look at the internal and hence undocumented _tree attribute.
I feel that should be easier to doo.
