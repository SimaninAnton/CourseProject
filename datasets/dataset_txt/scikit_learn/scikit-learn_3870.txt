The underlying CV functions in both cross_val_score and GridSearchCV have an option to shuffle inputs but these aren't exposed. This requires the user to shuffle their examples ahead of time. This is somewhat inconsistent with train_test_split that uses ShuffleSplit and, for the uninformed user, might cause confusion in output results in cases where the underlying inputs have some order (like in the wine quality dataset for example).
Would it be possible to expose shuffle as a parameter in both cross_val_score and GridSearchCV and simply pass it through to _check_cv and on to StratifiedKFold and KFold?
