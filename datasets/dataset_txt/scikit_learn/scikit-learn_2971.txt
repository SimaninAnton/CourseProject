I wanted to generate the full web page of "http://scikit-learn.org" under the guide of "scikit-learn-master\doc\README.md", there are the error messages:
D:\scikit-learn-master\doc>make html
Running Sphinx v1.3.1
Exception occurred:
File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\subprocess.py", line 1220, in _execute_child
startupinfo)
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] 系统找不到指定的文件。
The full traceback has been saved in C:...\Local\Temp\sphinx-err-c4x44do0.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
A bug report can be filed in the tracker at https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues. Thanks!
Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html.
I opened up D:\Anaconda3\lib\subprocess.py found line 1220 was that winapi create process
   try:
        hp, ht, pid, tid = _winapi.CreateProcess(executable, args,
                                 # no special security
                                 None, None,
                                 int(not close_fds),
                                 creationflags,
                                 env,
                                 cwd,
                                 startupinfo)
And there is the attachment file.
