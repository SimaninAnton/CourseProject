As stated in the title, svm.NuSVC training can crash the process, when being fed with a certain dataset. To reproduce the error, download:

Running the script gives me a message:
python debug.py 
*** glibc detected *** python: double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0000000001231800 ***
The dataset shape is (4868, 50).
I use 64-bit linux (Ubuntu natty). The issue manifests with both 0.8 release and with upstream trunk.
