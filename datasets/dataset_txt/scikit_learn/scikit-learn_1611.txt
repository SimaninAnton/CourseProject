Hi,
I have a huge training set, where I normalize each feature using the StandardScalar. I want to use the same mean and std deviation which was calculated during this normalization of training data to normalize the test data. Also, i don't have the test data beforehand and it comes at run-time.
In nutshell, i am trying to follow what has been mentioned in https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/174823/how-to-apply-standardization-normalization-to-train-and-testset-if-prediction-i
using sklearn StandardScalar
