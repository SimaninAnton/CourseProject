I added a comment to issue #3410, but then I noticed the issue had been closed, so I'll repeat my comment here:
I still see this issue with the csv.DictReader.
def valid(row):
    return  row["First Name"] and row["Last Name"] and row["Address"]

    def read(self):
        with open(self.filename) as csvFile:
            csvreader = csv.DictReader(csvFile)
            validRecords = [ row for row in csvreader if valid(row) ]
            for row in validRecords:
                print(row)
            print("import contains %d valid records" % len(validRecords))
            csvFile.close()
        return validRecords
I still get the warning, and I get it whether or not the csvFile.close() line is present. This is with python 3.4.
