Historical thing that is not relevant anymore go to #8959 (comment) for the current problem:
See https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/237455099 for example.
Expected:
    GaussianProcess(beta0=None, corr=<function squared_exponential at 0x...>,
            normalize=True, nugget=array(2.22...-15),
            ...

Got:

    GaussianProcess(beta0=None,
            corr=<function squared_exponential at 0x2b0bb7aa5ae8>,
            normalize=True, nugget=array(  2.22045e-15),
            ...
Additional leading space in the repr of the nugget parameter.
