There is a wrong information in the current stable docs (version 0.17.1), in FunctionTransformer section [1].
In the func parameter explanation there is this information: "The callable to use for the transformation. This will be passed the same arguments as transform, with args and kwargs forwarded".
But, the kwargs forward is implemented only in branch master yet. It does not work in version 0.17.1.
