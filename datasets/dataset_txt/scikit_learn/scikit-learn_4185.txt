Reported on SO: extract_patches_2d returns an empty set of patches.
>>> from sklearn.feature_extraction import image as image
>>> c=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
>>> image.extract_patches_2d( c, (1, 4) )
array([], shape=(0, 1, 4), dtype=int64)
I'm not sure what the correct behavior should be (ValueError?), but an empty set of patches doesn't seem very useful.
