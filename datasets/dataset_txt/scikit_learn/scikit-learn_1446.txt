Hello,
I could not find the reference(s) used to implement the fast coordinate descent algorithm for Elastic Net.
I guess that it at least relies on the following paper:
Regularization Path For Generalized linear Models by Coordinate Descent. J. Friedman, T. Hastier, R. Tibshirani.
And may be another reference for the stopping criterion based on dual gap.
Could it be possible to add those references in the documentation.
Thanks.
