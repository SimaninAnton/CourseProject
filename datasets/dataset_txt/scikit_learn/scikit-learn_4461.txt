Sparse_std should work both csc and csr matrices.
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=1000)
X[X < 2.5] = 0.0
X = sparse.csr_matrix(X)
sparse_std(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], X.data, X.indices, X.indptr)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
I'll give a shot at this if everyone is ok with fixing this up.
