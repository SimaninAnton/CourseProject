Now that there are 8 jobs on azure, may we use linting as a dependency on some of these jobs to save resources? For example the following will always run:
Linux32 py35_ubuntu_atlas_32bit
Linux pylatest_pip_openblas_pandas
macOS pylatest_conda_mkl
Windows py37_conda_mkl
The rest will run linting first, and only when lint passes, the rest of the tests will run.
I hope this proposal is a good balance of lowering our carbon footprint and also have the benefits of having tests always run.
