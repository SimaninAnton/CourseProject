Great to see the new CalibratedClassifierCV in 0.16, and I'm wondering if anyone wants to take a stab at a CalibratedRegressorCV analogue which adapts the isotonic regression method for continuous outputs. Calibration provides the same benefit for continuous predictions as it does for probabilities, so it seems like a natural extension, and it should be pretty straightforward for someone who's familiar with the development process (which unfortunately disqualifies this mere mortal/user).
As I understand the current calibration code, the changes required would be very minimal, since nothing about isotonic regression requires probabilities as output. In my own code, I currently use the same custom function for calibration of both types of outputs, just tweaking the prediction step of the original model from model.predict_proba(x)[:,1] to model.predict(x). Other than that, creating CalibratedRegressorCV should be mostly a copy-and-paste of the CalibratedClassifierCV code, with the necessary adjustments in going between regression and classification.
Thanks!
