Hi,
I recently asked a question on StackOverflow here about an issue that I encountered with scikit-learn's GridSearch and memory utilization.
Basically, it allocated more and more memory the longer it runs after the job fails when it reaches the 128 GB on the system I am running it on. I have more details written in the StackOverflow question I linked above, and I also created a GitHub repo where I put the script and data if you want to reproduce this issue.
