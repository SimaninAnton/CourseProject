The file that travis reads for testing is test_script.sh, and it is supposed to run pytest and then make test-doc
However, it seems that make test-doc isn't run if the first pytest command fails. This happened to me on #11705:
first travis log where pytest fails, make test-doc isn't called: https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/435669785
second travis log where pytest succeeds and make test-doc is run (and fails): https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/435711770
The issues in the second log could have been caught the first time, avoiding a reviewing round.
I have no idea why make test-doc isn't run though, looking at test_script.sh there's no reason to stop testing if the first pytest fails
