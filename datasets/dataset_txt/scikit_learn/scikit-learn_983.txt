For the equation of m(x_i) is as fellow:
m(x_i) = \frac{\sum_{x_j \in N(x_i)}K(x_j - x_i)x_j}{\sum_{x_j \in N(x_i)}K(x_j - x_i)}
Given a candidate centroid x_i for iteration t, the candidate is updated according to the following equation:
x_i^{t+1} = x_i^t + m(x_i^t)
The right equation should be:
x_i^{t+1} = m(x_i^t)
