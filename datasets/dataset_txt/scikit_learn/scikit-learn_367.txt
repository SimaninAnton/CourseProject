Description
I am using SGDRegressor for training a model. Is there any way i can store the Bias and the Norm values for each iteration in the training loop ?
Using verbose i can see the output , I just want to store the parameters in a list. I was trying to run the regressor in a for loop as it returns an instance of itself, but that did'nt work
clf = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1, alpha=alpha)                                                                                              
for counter in range (0,epochs):
    clf.fit(X, Y)
    print("slope {0}, intercept {1}".format(clf.coef_, clf.intercept_))
Can someone help me out ?
thanks....
