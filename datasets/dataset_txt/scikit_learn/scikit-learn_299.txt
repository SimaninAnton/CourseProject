I created a custom transformer that has some parameters it receives in the constructor. However, putting it as a stage in a ColumnTransformer causes it to be called with every parameter set to None.
An example in this notebook:

(This bug happens even when i pass "param" a value in the creation of t in the definition of p and c2).
