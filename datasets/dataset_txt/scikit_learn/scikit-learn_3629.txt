I apologize ahead of time if this bug exists only on my system. This has got to be the most odd error I've ever gotten. I can't figure out why I can't import PCA:
>>> from sklearn.decomposition import pca
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sklearn/decomposition/__init__.py", line 19, in <module>
    from .online_lda import LatentDirichletAllocation
  File "sklearn/decomposition/online_lda.py", line 26, in <module>
    from ._online_lda import (mean_change, _dirichlet_expectation_1d,
ImportError: No module named _online_lda
The current branch I am using is the master branch I have forked here. There are no changes between my forked master branch and my local version of scikit-learn. Furthermore, my local version is up to date with my forked version.
The forked version on my github is passing the build, yet when I run nosetests on my computer, I get the same error when starting up the PCA tests.
Thoughts? Is anyone else having this issue?
