In file sklearn/cluster/dbscan_.py:
if metric == 'precomputed' and sparse.issparse(X):
In the else clause it goes on to do NearestNeighbors.
I am using cosine_distances on a CountVectorizer-ed list of texts. This is not a sparse matrix and I am getting strange results from DBSCAN. Am I missing something simple? Or is DBSCAN really not using my precomputed distance matrix (since it is not sparse)?
