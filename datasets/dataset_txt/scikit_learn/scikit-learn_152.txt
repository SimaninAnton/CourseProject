It would be good add an explicit CI for python 3.8
python 3.8 is on conda (default and conda-forge), also numpy, scipy and pandas have python 3.8 wheels.
I though that pylatest_conda_mkl (Azure) might be taking the latest python on conda, but it doesn't seem to be the case.
The issue for building corresponding wheels is MacPython/scikit-learn-wheels#34
