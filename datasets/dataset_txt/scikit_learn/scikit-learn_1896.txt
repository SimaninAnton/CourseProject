SGD{Classifier,Regressor}, PassiveAggressive{Classifier,Regressor} and Perceptron all now issue a FutureWarning if they are fit without specifying one of {max_iter, tol} parameters explicitly. Together with the issue raised in #9752, our documentation building thus issues hundreds of warnings. We should explicitly specify max_iter and tol for uses in examples/ and doc/ so that warnings aren't issued.
