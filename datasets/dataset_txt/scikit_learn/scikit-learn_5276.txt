I get::
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tell'",) in <bound method memmap.del of memmap(1.70710087163e-313)> ignored
and
Warning: file "/tmp/tmpxxaFga/test.pkl934" appears to be a zip, ignoring mmap_mode "r" flag passed
@GaelVaroquaux do you know where this comes from? And is it easy to fix?
