Description
At page "Confusion matrix"
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html
function plot_confusion_matrix shows same image for normalization=True and for normalization=False. Numbers differ, but not colors.
(Image of normalized confusion matrix in this page is wrong in the same way: colors of top-left and bottom right corners are different, while both have same value 1.0)
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Run code form example.
Expected Results
Plot different images for normalized and not normalized confusion matrices.
Actual Results
Plots same image but with different numbers.
How to fix:
Move block
if normalize:
        cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
        print("Normalized confusion matrix")
    else:
        print('Confusion matrix, without normalization')

print(cm)
before
plt.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)
