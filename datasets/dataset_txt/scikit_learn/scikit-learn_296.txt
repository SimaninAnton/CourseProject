In the Returns section of sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate.html) , the names test_score, and train_score for keys in return dict, changes to test_r2, train_r2 or test_auc , train_auc, if there are multiple scoring metrics in the scoring parameter for the cross_validate method.
