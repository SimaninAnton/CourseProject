Here is an overview of the work done so far relating to plotting:
#8425 - Decision Regions of Classifiers
#9173 - Confusion matrix and grid search
#8425 - Calibration curve
#12599 - Partial Dependence
To help control the scope of sklearn.plot, I propose we only do plotting on the axes level and not the figure level. The user would pass in the axes as a keyword. As a convenience, the default of axes will be None. Only in this case, will the plotting function generate a axes/figure to plot on.
