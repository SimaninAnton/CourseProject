Description
Documentation names regression model variables "clf" which is the abbreviation for "classifier". This confuses beginners.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Watch novices (and even experts) copy/paste code from the linear_model.py module docs and try to explain to them why their regressor is named "clf" ;)
Expected Results
reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
Novices should be encouraged to use proper names for regression models like "regression_model" (to by pythonic) or "reg" (for short). These objects have a different API (attributes, methods, inputs, outputs) , so names different from classifiers would remind novices of the API they're working with.
Actual Results
clf = linear_model.LinearRegression()
Versions
All versions and platforms are affected (I can recall this confusing me when I first started using sklearn more than 5 years ago).
