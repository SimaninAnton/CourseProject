I mentioned this issue on the ML a while back but since it hasn't been addressed yet, I create this report to track it.
Basically, grid search uses Parallel to compute out, which is a list of triplets (score, estimator, n_test_samples). Unfortunately, some estimators take a lot of space in memory (e.g., SVCs because the support vectors are copied in each estimator). It would be better to return only the best estimator directly and delete the other ones as they are computed.
