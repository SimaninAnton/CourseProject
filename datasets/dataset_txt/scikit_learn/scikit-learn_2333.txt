for example, to use 20newsgroup datasets, it will download it from internet(/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.py), then open it, but in some kind of situation, it can't connect to internet, already get the dataset file.
i think should support read the local dataset.
my recommend code added:
if os.path.exists(twenty_home):
train_path = os.path.join(twenty_home, TRAIN_FOLDER)
test_path = os.path.join(twenty_home, TEST_FOLDER)
cache = dict(train=load_files(train_path, encoding='latin1'),
test=load_files(test_path, encoding='latin1'))
