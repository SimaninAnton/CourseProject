We recently merged the PowerTransformer, but we believe that it would be helpful to users (who are presumably applying this because they want features with similar distributions) to automatically apply a standard scaler to the output. This would be controlled by a parameter, but would default to True.
Just using this issue to record the consensus at #10210... Ping @ericchang00.
