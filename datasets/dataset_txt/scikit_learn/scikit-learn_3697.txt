I apologize if any issue already exists for this because I did not see it.
It would be great if you could set a parameter to GridSearchCV that adds an attribute (best_pred_) that contains the predictions from the fold in cross validation that had the best score. Having these predictions would be extremely useful for a number of things, the most notable being stacking models outside of a complicated pipeline. As it stands now I generally have to write my own GridSearch function when stacking models which isn't all that burdensome but seems unnecessary.
