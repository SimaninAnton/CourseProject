I have run the python3 setup.py install command under scilit-learn-0.19.1 directory in dist-packages in python 3.5. I am still getting the following Failure message when I try to run nosetests -v sklearn. I am stuck.
numpy version 1.13.3
scipy version 1.0.0
scikit-learn version 0.19.1
python3 version 3.5.2
pip version latest 9.x
I installed scikit-learn using the official instructions as well as from the source.
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/scikit-learn-0.19.1# nosetests -v sklearn
ikit-learn from source, please do not forget
to build the package before using it: run python setup.py install or
make in the source directory.
If you have used an installer, please check that it is suited for your
Python version, your operating system and your platform.
