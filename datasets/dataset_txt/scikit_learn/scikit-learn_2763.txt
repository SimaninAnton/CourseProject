scikit support for calculating accuracy, precision, recall, mse and mae for multi-class classification. but i want the count of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative, true positive rate, false posititve rate and auc. How to calculate this? is there any in-built functions in scikit. while searching in google i got confused. This is not the place to post this question. But as a begginner i didn't find any other way. Please can you help for calculating these performance measures for multi-class classification
