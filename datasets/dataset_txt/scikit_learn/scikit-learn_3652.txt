Hi,
I installed scikit-learn from Anaconda without any apparent errors since I get a confirmation that the package is up to date:
C:\Users\Anaconda3>conda update scikit-learn
Fetching package metadata: ....
\# All requested packages already installed.
\# packages in environment at C:\Users\Anaconda3:
\#
scikit-learn    0.16.1  np19py34_0
However, whenever I actually try to use it, I get the recurring error message:
ERROR: Failure: ImportError (cannot import name 'doccer')
I ran nosetests to check the installation of sklearn and the same error about this 'doccer' thing comes up. Just what are these import errors and how can I fix them? I have uninstalled and re-installed scikit many times, both with pip and conda, but to no avail.
My specs are as follows:
Python 3.4.1
Anaconda 2.1.0
Computer: Windows 7 (32-bit)
IDE: Spyder 2.3.1
