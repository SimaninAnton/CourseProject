I recently downloaded scikit-learn-0.11 from the website (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), but I ran into some issues trying to use ward.
Specifically, I want to define a connectivity matrix such that two sample points are said to be connected if they within a certain distance.
When I feed this to Ward, I first ran into item assignment issues. When I changed it from a coo_matrix to a lil_matrix, I was getting index errors.
I found the repo after some digging around and have checked out the latest version. From the cloned repo, I typed "python setup.py install".
However, I'm still getting index errors, but with a new warning ("UserWarning: the number of connected components of the connectivity matrix is 3 > 1. Completing it to avoid stopping the tree early.").
I was wondering if this is because I have some weird conflicts with old code still being used.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
