sklearn's various PCA class all approximate the decomposition A = U*S*V.T, where A is assumed to be samples x features, and V is a k x features array of components. In each case, both the U and V unitary matrices are computed, but only V gets assigned to self.components_, and U is discarded.
However, sometimes it's also very useful to have the other unitary matrix U, which would correspond to the components if A was transposed. For example, spatiotemporal ICA operates on both 'spatial' and 'temporal' PCs.
I think there ought to be at least an option in the PCA classes to store the U matrix as well as V.
