When I use a RandomForestClassifier which njobs greater than 1, I notice that the child processes from joblib use the same amount of memory as the parent process.
Is this intentional? I would expect it to only use the memory required by the data being analyzed (either the X_argsorted or the X values used by the underlying trees)
