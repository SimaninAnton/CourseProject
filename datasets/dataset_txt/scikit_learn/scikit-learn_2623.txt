Description
I want to use a custom distance function instead of MSE,MAE or FriedmanMSE. Is it possible to incorporate any user defined custom cost function in my case which is Earth mover distance(EMD) to minimize the cost while selecting the best split attribute. It seems like https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/tree/_criterion.pyx is the file i need to work on. I wanted to ensure that i am getting it right so i can modify the implementation according to my need.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
cdef class RegressionCriterion(Criterion):
"""Abstract regression criterion.
This handles cases where the target is a continuous value, and is
evaluated by computing the variance of the target values left and right
of the split point. The computation takes linear time with n_samples
by using ::
var = \sum_i^n (y_i - y_bar) ** 2
= (\sum_i^n y_i ** 2) - n_samples * y_bar ** 2
"""
Shouldn't implementing a new function like this one with emd work?
