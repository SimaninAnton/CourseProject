Description
The current list of attributes for GradientBoostingClassifier in the docs mentions oob_improvement_ however that attribute is not set:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
clf = GradientBoostingClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.oob_improvement_
last line will error no attribute 'oob_improvement_'
Solution
Remove oob_improvement_ from attributes.
as per comment below
specify both in classifier and regressor that it's only set when subsamples<1
Edit: btw it looks like the same problem holds with the regressor. I'll let someone who knows more about this take over, the PR #15026 may not be relevant as a result, apologies if that's the case.
