Description
I think there is an error in documentation of function sklearn.manifold.t_sne.trustworthiness. Indeed, it says: `r(i, j)` is the rank of the embedded datapoint j according to the pairwise distances between the embedded datapoints. However, this cannot be true because then the trustworthiness would be >=1 (since `U^{(k)}_i` is the set of points that are in the k nearest neighbors in the embedded space but not in the original space, so r(i, j) < k if j is in U^{(k)}_i)
I think the problem comes from a note in the paper "Learning a Parametric Embedding by Preserving Local Structure" (L.J.P. van der Maaten) which says the same thing, but there must be an error in it. Indeed, in the original paper defining trustworthiness ("Neighborhood Preservation in Nonlinear Projection Methods: An Experimental Study" J. Venna, S. Kaski), we have the same formula but with r(i,j) being the rank of point j according to the pairwise distances between the original datapoints, which is coherent with trustworthiness being between 0 and 1.
Fortunately, after going through the code I think it implements the good formula, so only a small rectification in the docstring of the function should be needed.
