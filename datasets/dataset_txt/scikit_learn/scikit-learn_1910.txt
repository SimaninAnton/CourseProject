There are several places where accepted distance metrics from scipy.spatial.distance are listed. It includes matching, which has been soft-deprecated (in docstring only) in SciPy for 2 years already. Example: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py#L305
I suggest to remove all references to matching. We may switch to regular deprecation (scipy/scipy#7630) for scipy 1.0 and then removing it, but anyway it's an alias only so no need to keep it around.
