sklearn.metrics.mutual_info_score [Source] does not calculate the mutual information correctly. For example: mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]) yields 0.17442 while it should have been 0.25163.
Blame: Commit a3dacb6 replaced np.log2 with np.log.
Fix: replacing the log_e with log2 repairs sklearn.metrics.mutual_info_score
