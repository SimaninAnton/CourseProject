gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor()
gpr.predict(X, return_cov=True)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
gpr.predict(X, return_std=True)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'diag'
This is because self.kernel is None during predict time. We should set self.kernel_ to be the default RBFKernel (as done during fit time) and return the correlation matrix of the RBFKernel.
