Hi,
I'm currently working on a project using NMF, and have implementing the Fast HALS solver mentioned in the papers [1] Fast local algorithms for large scale nonnegative matrix and tensor factorizations and [2] The Why and How of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization among others.
According to [2], the HALS solver generally converges better than the current mu and cd solvers, which matches my personal experience.
Given that I have implementing this solver anyway, I would be more than happy to contribute this code to sklearn if there is any demand.
I wanted to make sure that
(1) There are no currently existing efforts to implement this solver (I searched through the currently open issues and was unable to find any issues related to the HALS solver, but that might have been due to a fault on my behalf)
(2) This contribution meets the needs of scikit-learn (that it will not lead to a mere bloating of code)
Thanks,
Keita Kurita
