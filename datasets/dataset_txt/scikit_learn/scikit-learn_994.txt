We get couple of warnings from matplotlib (219 appearance in latest Circle CI log) after switching to matplotlib 3.X.
UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend,
so cannot show the figure. % get_backend())
I'm unable to reproduce locally so questions are:
(1) Will users get these warnings?
(2) Can we get rid of these warnings?
