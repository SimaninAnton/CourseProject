I want to revisit the question of having a formal code of conduct (#6070).
I just had a longer discussion with @reshamas, that I think somewhat reflected the points brought up by @willingc in #6070 (comment)
We do clearly have a diversity problem in the project, and at least in the US, the absence of a clear code of conduct might impede our ability to broaden the community.
@reshamas pointed out https://stackoverflow.com/conduct as a positive example.
Having a code of conduct more visible, such as suggested by the NumFocus project website standard might also be useful:
