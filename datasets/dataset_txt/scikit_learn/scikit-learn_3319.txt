I posted an issue on StackOverflow, in which I'd tried to test the successful pickling of a sklearn.cluster.k_means_.MiniBatchKMeans instance by comparing the result of loading what I'd just dumped in pickle. It seems that this isn't currently possible, as this doesn't implement or inherit __eq__.
Would adding __eq__ be a useful feature? I'd be happy to make a PR if so, but I don't know whether this is a sensible suggestion.
