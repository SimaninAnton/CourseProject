This is a follow up on #11679.
I don't think it makes sense to include the micro-average for multi-class classification. The three columns will always show the same value, all of which being the same as accuracy. I find that confusing. If you want to show this (I don't see why you'd want to show the same number three times), I would at least make it clear in the report that it's accuracy.
