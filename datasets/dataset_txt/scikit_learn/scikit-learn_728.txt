How do I get nearest cluster for a datapoint/object while doing silhouette analysis in sklearn.metrics.silhoutte_samples?
The original paper mentions:
"
The cluster B for which this minimum is attained (that is, d( i, B) = b(i)) we call the neighbor of
object i. This is like the second-best choice for object i: if it could not be accommodated into
cluster A, which cluster B would be the closest competitor? In Fig. 1, cluster B indeed appears to
be ‘closest’ (on the average) to object i, when A itself is discarded. Therefore, it is very useful to
know the neighbor of each object in the data set.
"
I'm assuming the changes in code should be made in the following function,
line:120 for _silhoutette_reduce() in scikit-learn/sklearn/metrics/cluster/unsupervised.py
What would help in getting the nearest cluster/label for a given sample?
