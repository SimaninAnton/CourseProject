(I put this here for further reference.)
With the introduction of SelectorMixin (feature_selection module) in #478, it has been noticed that some code could be factorized around that new class. In particular, CoefSelectTransformerMixin (from linear_model/base.py) should be deprecated, and some other code in the univariate selection module might be factorized.
See the discussion in #478 for further details.
