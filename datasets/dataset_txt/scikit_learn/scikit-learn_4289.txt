There have been some discussion about adding a balanced accuracy metrics (see this article for the definition) on the mailing list. This is a good opportunity for a first contribution.
This implies coding the function, checking correctness through tests and highlight your work with documentations. In order to be easily used by many, a balanced accuracy scorer is a good idea. As a bonus, it could also support sample_weight.
