Both metrics are not in the THRESHOLDED_METRICS dictionnary in test_metrics.
I haven't looked in detail, but I think that some tests are missing for
that sort of cases
In [1]: from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
In [2]: import numpy as np
In [3]: y_score = np.random.rand(4,3)
In [4]: y_true = 4 * ["yes"] # or  y_true =  ["yes", "no", "n/a", "maybe"] 
In [5]: log_loss(y_true, y_score)
