The docs currently suggest new contributors find Easy issues. This is still a good idea, but increasingly we're using the "Need Contributor" label for issues regardless of the difficulty of the issue (which is often hard to estimate). We also use "Need Contributor" to mark Pull Requests that the original contributor has abandoned, i.e available for someone to pick up where they left off.
This label should be mentioned alongside Easy in the contributing docs.
