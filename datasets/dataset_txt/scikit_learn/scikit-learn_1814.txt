In both CONTRIBUTING.md and doc/developers/contributing.rst, we have a checklist which list the things to check before submitting a pull request. (See the list in CONTRIBUTING.md and contributing.rst). The two lists are almost the same (many entries are exactly the same). But both lists are missing something from each other. For example, in .md file, we have an entry to mention expected time and space complexity but that's not in .rst file. In .rst file, we mention PEP8 check but that's not in .md file. I think it might be better to copy-paste between the two files to make the two checklist consistent.
cc @jnothman @lesteve WDYT? Thanks :)
