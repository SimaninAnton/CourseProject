It seems the 'spherical' cvtype is using a different representation of the covariances. Docs still state it to be:
(n_components,) if 'spherical',
(n_features, n_features) if 'tied',
(n_components, n_features) if 'diag',
(n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'
indeed not it seems to be:
(n_components, n_features) if 'spherical', so that 'spherical' is the same as 'diag' with a constant diagonal
It is a pita to change my code with every update of sklearn tbh.. could you perhaps settle for a naming and representation schema?
