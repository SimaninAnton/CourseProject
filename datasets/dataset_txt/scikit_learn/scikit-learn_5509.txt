The docstring for DBSCAN doesn't show up on the website (it should be here, I guess). I tried fixing this by adding
.. currentmodule:: sklearn.cluster.dbscan_
in doc/modules/clustering.rst, but that didn't solve the issue. Also, listing it in doc/modules/classes.rst doesn't do the trick.
The first mention of DBSCAN in the narrative docs is a :class: link in the rST, but it doesn't become a link in the HTML.
