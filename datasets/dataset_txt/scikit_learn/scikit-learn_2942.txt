While trying to use RFECV with KNeighborsClassifier I got the following error:
RuntimeError: The classifier does not expose "coef_" or "feature_importances_" attributes
According to:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37780139/knn-with-rfecv-returns-the-classifier-does-not-expose-coef-or-feature-impo/37971791#37971791
it seems like KNN does not support feature selection. I would like to confirm this and if it is so would propose that this be added.
TIA.
