If you have a small number of training points, say 3 points, then OneClassSVM fails. I've set nu to be 0.02, so I expect that I'll probably have none of my training points missclassified, but doing this:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3.0],
                 [1, 2, 3.1],
                 [1, 2, 3.2]])

est = OneClassSVM(nu=0.02, kernel='rbf')
est.fit(data)
print(est.predict(data))
outputs:
[-1. -1. -1.]
If nu is 0.02 or less, it missclassifies all training points. If you change nu to be 0.03, it suddenly starts classifying them all correctly.
