I just sent this to the mailing list, not sure if it went through, given the state of sourceforge:
Hi all.
I am wondering whether we should move the mailing list to google groups. I am not sure if the mailing list currently works,
so this is also just a ping.
This list attaches spam / adds and the archive is really bad to read. It is not really possible to follow a thread without subscribing.
Downside to move to google groups: everybody would have to resubscribe, and the archive would be split [probably not that big an issue].
Is it possible to do a soft move? We can probably forward the groups to the sourceforge list so that people get the mail,
and we can probably reject all mails to the sourceforge list with a message that people should move.
What do people think?
Cheers,
Andy
