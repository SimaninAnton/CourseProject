Description
The documentation for the alpha parameter in Ridge is:
alpha : {float, array-like}, shape (n_targets)
Small positive values of alpha improve the conditioning of the problem and reduce the variance of the estimates. Alpha corresponds to C^-1 in other linear models such as LogisticRegression or LinearSVC. If an array is passed, penalties are assumed to be specific to the targets. Hence they must correspond in number.
I believe the sentence "Small positive values of alpha improve the conditioning of the problem and reduce the variance of the estimates" is misleading (it certainly mislead me), because it makes you think that small(er) values of alpha imply stronger regularization.
Proposed rephrasing
Regularization strength; must be a positive float. Regularization improves the conditioning of the problem and reduce the variance of the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization. Alpha corresponds to C^-1 in other linear models such as LogisticRegression or LinearSVC. If an array is passed, penalties are assumed to be specific to the targets. Hence they must correspond in number.
