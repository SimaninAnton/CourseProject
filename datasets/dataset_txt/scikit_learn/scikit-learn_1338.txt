Description
In the documentation, the return part of the split method on sklearn.model_selection.GroupShuffleSplit is incorrect
Doc says the split method returns:
train : ndarray
     The training set indices for that split.

test : ndarray
     The testing set indices for that split.
Whilst it returns a generator.
[Not sure if small doc issues should be raised or directly submitted as pull request, apologies if I did it wrong]
