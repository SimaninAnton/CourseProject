As I commented on in #5459, I think it would be nice if we could have circle ci build the stable website.
It is often nice to fix up minor things (like the adding of the contributors PR, or #5933).
Just building from the branches shouldn't be an issue. We can always build to the version folder, and just change the symlinks when doing a release.
