When running PCA with svd_solver='auto' there is no way to know which solver was used in fit short of inspecting the logic in the code.
It would be helpful to have an easier way of inspecting the selected solver, the current situation makes debugging issues like #8236 harder.
For instance, NearestNeighbours also accepts the solver="auto" attribute, but in fit the actual solver used is stored in the _fit_method attribute (albeit private it is sufficient for debugging).
