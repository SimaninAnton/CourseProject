OneClassSVM fit seems to run infinitely on my train data for all kernels. The other args are default ones.
oc_svm = OneClassSVM(max_iter=10, verbose=True)
oc_svm.fit(X, preds_correct)
joblib.dump(X, 'X.dmp')
joblib.dump(preds_correct, 'y.dmp')
X.shape # (278217, 19)
Also, max_iter and verbose seem to have no effect.
Xy.tar.lzma.zip
Actually, this is a tar.lzma and not a zip file, so remove .zip.
PS: Current versions of numpy, scipy, sklearn.
