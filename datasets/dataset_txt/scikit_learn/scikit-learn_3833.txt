Hi, documentation may needed for the method make_blobs and make_classification, to explain the differences between these two approaches.
Current usage of these two methods can be found Plot randomly generated classification datasets, but no info on the differences.
Description in make_blobs only says make_classification as "a more intricate variant" method.
#4671 use make_classification to generate 50 classes, and random-forests gives very low accuracy, if use make_blob instead the accuracy is 100%
Thus I feel we need to have document on this.
