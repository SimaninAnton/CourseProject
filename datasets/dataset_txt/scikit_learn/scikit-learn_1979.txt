We found the alerts from lgtm.com useful. We recently had an alert added by a PR merged into master: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/rev/312b1dfc74aeb6666a869fdc59971bd348dd097b. This is, again, a true positive.
So we should consider adding lgtm.com to our CI, at least as a trial.
