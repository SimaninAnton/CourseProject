I get entirely different result when I permute features while using
MLPClassifier, as shown below:
featindx = range(10)
data = data[:,featindx]

# shuffling the features 
shuffle(featindx)
new_data = data[:,featindx]
using data and new_data results in two completely different answers. what could be the reason?
is there any parameter in MLPClassifier, which should
that somehow optimize or select features as in RandomForest
