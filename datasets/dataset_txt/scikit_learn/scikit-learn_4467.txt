When I run the following code sample
from sklearn.linear_model.base import sparse_center_data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=50)
X = sparse.csr_matrix(X)
sparse_center_data(X, y, True)
Out: <100x50 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>'
with 30 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Column format>
Is this expected? I would expect the output to be stored in the same way as the input. Just wanted to make sure before I try anything.
