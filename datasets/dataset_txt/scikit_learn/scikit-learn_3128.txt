I have the scikit-learn library in version 0.17.1 which is supposed to support sample_weight option for SVC or Logistic Regression but these two lines won't work :
clf = svm.SVC( probability = True)
clf.fit(train_data, train_labels,sample_weight=sample_weight)
Saying that argument sample_weight isn't allowed for the method svm.SVC. Similarly I get the same issue with le logisticRegression.
