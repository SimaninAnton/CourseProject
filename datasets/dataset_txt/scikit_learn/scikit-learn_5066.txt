The class_prior in NB should be an __init__ parameter, not fit parameter imho.
I thought we had moved all parameter that don't depend on the number of samples to fit.
It just came up on the ml.
Also, if it is an __init__ parameter, maybe it should be called class_weight. Depends on whether the meaning and range of values is the same as for the linear algorithms.
