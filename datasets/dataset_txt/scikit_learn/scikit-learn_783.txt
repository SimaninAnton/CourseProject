It looks like we stopped parallelizing tests with our move to pytest. I'm not sure if this was a conscious decision but it makes running tests locally much slower.
This is unlikely to influence CI but it would be nice to allow this again locally.
It should be fairly easy with xdist, but it doesn't work right now in some instances, see pytest-dev/pytest#4101
The common metrics tests in particular seem to pass non-deterministic things.
