Hi,
I am trying to feed my data which is continuous (time series) to the RBM program. By running the program I got this error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "RBM_traffic_reduceddata_column_justflow.py", line 187, in <module>
    classifier.predict(inputs_test))))
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/metrics.py", line 1880, in classification_report
    labels = unique_labels(y_true, y_pred)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/utils/multiclass.py", line 98, in unique_labels
    raise ValueError("Unknown label type")
ValueError: Unknown label type
I created some labels and added "labels" to metrics.classification_report () function,but the problem is that metrics.py does not support continuous labels, or multiclass-multioutput labels or a mix of continuous targets and binary labels.
Any help or comment would be greatly appreciated.
