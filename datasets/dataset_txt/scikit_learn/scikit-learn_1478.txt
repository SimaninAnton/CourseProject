Description
cross_val_score doesn't have an option to shuffle the data before splitting into k folds. This will prevent the user from having a similar distribution for the train and test set due to the un-shuffled dataset. The workaround is to simply shuffle the data before passing it to the cross_val_score, however, an internal option to shuffle the data would be a nice add!
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data[:150]
y = diabetes.target[:150]
lasso = linear_model.Lasso()
print(cross_val_score(lasso, X, y)) 
Expected Results
No error is thrown. However, if there was an option to shuffle the data before splitting, we would have gotten a vector of scores that were similar since the train and test set would come from similar distributions due to the random sampling of the data.
Actual Results
However, we get a vector of scores like this: [ 0.33150734 0.08022311 0.03531764] where due to the un-shuffled dataset the scores across different splits of the data are significantly different.
