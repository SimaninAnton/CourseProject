The function normalize returns A / Asum, should do A /= Asum; return A.
The convergence check in BaseHMM.fit should probably not use abs().
GaussianHMM._init should probably use the all the observations instead of just the first one to compute the means and covariances.
Would be nice if BaseHMM.fit would set an attribute self.logprob_ = logprob before returning self, so that callers can examine how the training went.
I'm new to this, so I won't try to change the code myself.
