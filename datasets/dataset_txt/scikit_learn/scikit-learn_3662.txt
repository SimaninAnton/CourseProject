Hi,
I'm getting negative R2 values when using the score method for support vector regression (using 0.16.1):
from sklearn import svm, preprocessing
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
x = preprocessing.scale(data.drop(["y"], axis=1))
y = data["y"]
clf = svm.SVR()
clf.fit(x,y)
clf.score(x,y)
Output: -0.1824106150808722
Here's my data from test.csv. Each x variable is a lagged version of the previous (it's from a time series)
x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,y
