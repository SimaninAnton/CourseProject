scikit-learn's PCA uses scipy.linalg.svd to compute the singular value decomposition of X.
Because the solution is unique up to a change in sign in pairs of left and right singular vectors, the .fit method then uses svd_flip to enforce deterministic output.
This consists of
Adjust[ing] the columns of u and the rows of v such that the loadings in the
columns in u that are largest in absolute value are always positive.
And svd_flip comes with a parameter u_based_decision (default True) that allows for flipping this logic if the parameter is False. However, this parameter is not present in PCA.fit() or any of its similar methods.
Why not add this parameter to PCA's methods and then pass it to svd_flip? This will affect a critical attribute, components_, which is simply equal to V. Otherwise, the only real way to use u_based_decision=False within PCA itself is to rewrite from the ground up with a lot of code copy/pasting involved.
