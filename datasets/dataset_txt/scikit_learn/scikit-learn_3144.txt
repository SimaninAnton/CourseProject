When testing a PR, the run failed on this job, but passed on the other configurations. There is a note that "This job ran on our new platform for Precise builds. Please read our blog post for more information.", but that was also the case for the previous passing test so seems unrelated.
Here is the section from the log showing that the failure occurred when trying to install libatlas-dev and scipy.
436    The command "sudo -E apt-get -yq --no-install-suggests --no-install-recommends --force-yes install libatlas-dev python-scipy" failed and exited with 100 during .
The only change between commits was removing an unused import. I can't see how that could have caused the problem so I can assume a change at Travis's end?
