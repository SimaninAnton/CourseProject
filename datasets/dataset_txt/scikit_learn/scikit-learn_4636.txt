While moving from {train_test_split/fit/score} to cross_val_score, a bug was found:
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py", line 1058, in _cross_val_score
  y_train = y[train]
TypeError: only integer arrays with one element can be converted to an index
It seems that the y parameter is expected to be an array and not a list. This behaviour is not documented and differs from train_test_split.
Two solutions:
Document this behaviour.
Call check_arrays within cross_val_score
