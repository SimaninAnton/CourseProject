libraries.io allows users to subscribe to release notifications for scikit-learn:
https://libraries.io/pypi/scikit-learn page
When there is a new scikit-learn release, subscribers automatically get an email notification with the news, including any release notes listed under https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/releases.
This is valuable but many users don't know about it. Might be worth including a link to https://libraries.io/pypi/scikit-learn in the docs along with a prompt to subscribe to releases.
