The n_components kwarg defined in the spectral_clustering function allow the user to choose how many eigenvalues/eigenvectors should be used in the classification.
However this kwarg cannot be accessed/modified when using SpectralClustering class, and is set to default (n_components = nb_clusters). Since the SpectralClustering class calls the spectral_clustering function, I guess the user should be able to access this kwarg ?
