SelectFromModel's _get_support_mask method is a useful way of figuring out which features were selected (or dropped). There other ways, but this one liner is the most direct.
But it's undocumented, so you have to read the source code to figure this out. And the method is named with a leading underscore (presumably to indicate that it is an unsupported private method and liable to change).
I think it would improve usability if it were documented and public.
The easiest way to make it public without breaking code that depends on the current API might be to add (and document) a support_mask_ attribute, something like:
@property
def support_mask_(self):
    return self._get_support_mask()
Am I thinking on the right lines here? Or have I misunderstood scikit-learn's conventions? Would a PR be useful?
