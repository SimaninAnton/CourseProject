Hi,
I use t-SNE for dimentionality reduction of the output from different topic modelling models. Every time I run it it generates this error (below). I tried to look everywhere but couldn't find an explanation why it happens and how it can affect the results. Is this a bug?
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
tsne_model = TSNE(n_components=2, verbose=1, random_state=0)
tsne_tfidf = tsne_model.fit_transform(svd_tfidf)
