When writing tests, I am a bit tired of always having to figure out where the assertions I need are (some are in numpy, others are in nose). So I would like to import all useful assertions that we commonly use in sklearn.utils.testing. This way, we should be able to do from sklearn.utils.testing import ... in a consistent fashion. Also I would like to move fake_mldata and mock_urllib2 in another module. Any opinion?
