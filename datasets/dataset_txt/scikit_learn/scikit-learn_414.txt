On function "plot_partial_dependence", I think the "target" parameter is being ignored (in the multiclass setting) since the following line:
scikit-learn/sklearn/inspection/partial_dependence.py
Line 578 in 7813f7e
 target_idx = 0 
sets target_idx to 0 every time (ignoring previous lines in which the right column is selected).
When I run:
plot_partial_dependence(rf, X, [feature_column], feature_names=X.columns,  target="class_1", response_method="predict_proba", n_jobs=-1) 
plot_partial_dependence(rf, X, [feature_column], feature_names=X.columns,  target="class_2", response_method="predict_proba", n_jobs=-1) 
I get the same result two times (and I believe that result to be the "class_1" result)
