Description
When I use RFECV with parameter 'step' as a float number will cause warnings/errors "rfe.py:203: VisibleDeprecationWarning: using a non-integer number instead of an integer will result in an error in the future". And the analysis can't be finished until integer or 1/2.
I read description of RFECV and learned that parameter 'step' can accept float. (introduction online: If greater than or equal to 1, then step corresponds to the (integer) number of features to remove at each iteration. If within (0.0, 1.0), then step corresponds to the percentage (rounded down) of features to remove at each iteration.)
And I didn't read any bugs from source script. Please tell.
