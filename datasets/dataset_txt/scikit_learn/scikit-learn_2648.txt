The code below recreates a problem I noticed with LinearSVC. It does not work with hinge loss, L2 regularization, and primal solver.
It works fine for the dual solver. Is this a limitation of LibLinear, or something that could be fixed?
Thanks
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
import numpy as np

# create some random data
X = np.random.random((20, 2))
X[:10, :] += 1
Y = np.zeros(20)
Y[:10] = 1

# this works fine
clf_1 = LinearSVC(C=1.0, loss='squared_hinge', penalty='l2', dual=False)
clf_1.fit(X, Y)
print clf_1.predict(X)

# this throws an error
clf_2 = LinearSVC(C=1.0, loss='hinge', penalty='l2', dual=False)
clf_2.fit(X, Y)
print clf_2.predict(X)
