Hello,
I encountered a problem in the RFECV results:
svc = SVC(kernel="linear", C=1, probability=False, scale_C=False, shrinking=True, tol=0.001)
rfecv = RFECV(estimator=svc, step=1, cv=StratifiedKFold(y, 2) )
rfecv.fit(X, y)
the number of input features is X.shape[1]
but the scores are returned for len(rfecv.cv_scores_) subsets of features, that is lower by one than the number of input features
the rfecv.cv_scores_ should include also results of the worst combination of features (often all of them)
