newton_cg requires the function value to compute the step size (line search) but not to compute the descent direction: on line 105 fval is computed but never used. This means that we could just pass a grad_hess function instead of func_grad_hess. The overhead of computing the objective value when we already computed the gradient is not big but this is an opportunity to simplify the interface a little.
