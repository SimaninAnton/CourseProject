Here some inconsistencies that I have encountered when I wanted to use kernel:
The degree In KernelPCA, svm-kernel and SVC, they don't agree with the presence of the parameter degree for the sigmoid kernel.parameter of KernelPCA is said to be used for the rbf kernel. However in the svm kernel documentation, there isn't any mention of the degree parameter.
In KernelPCA, svm-kernel and SVC, they don't agree with the presence of the parameter degree for the sigmoid kernel.
In the kernel pca narrative doc and in KernelPCA, there isn't any link to the kernel definition
When you browse the narrative doc in Pairwise metrics, Affinities and Kernels, there is no pointer to the kernel approximation, definitions of all kernels and estimators/transformers that can use kernels.
The information about kernels is spread in at least four page. It would be nice that Pairwise metrics, Affinities and Kernels contains most information with links to the relevant pages (and backlink from these page).
