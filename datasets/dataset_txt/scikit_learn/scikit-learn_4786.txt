the methods are poorly documented (in particular, returned shapes)
there's no efficient fit_transform, I think one just needs to return sources_
there's no inverse_transform, we could provide one since we provide a way to get the mixing matrix
anticipating the 0.14 release, the deprecated property can be removed
Will do that tonight.
