I need convert continuous features (e.g. a feature in real number between 0. and 1.0) to discrete one, and didn't find a preprocessor in sklearn. I searched and got some way to do this by numpy.histogram or pandas.cut/qcut. They fit the requirement by not very convenient to use since they are not a sklearn component (i.e. support method fit, transform and fit_transform). I want to confirm that there really not this one in sklearn? Thanks
