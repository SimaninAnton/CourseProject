I executed the following code and met segmentation faults
import GPy
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def test():
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_jobs=2)
    km.fit(np.random.randn(5000,1))

test()
Without importing GPy, with fitting less data or with running only one job the above code ran successfully.
I executed the code under following environment.
OS X 10.10
Python 2.7
scikit-learn 0.17
GPy 0.8.8
