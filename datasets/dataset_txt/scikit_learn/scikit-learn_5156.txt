While there is some reference documentation:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html
the narrative documentation is completely lacking any reference to MinMaxScaler:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/preprocessing.html
We should add a dedicated paragraph (similar to the one for StandardScaler) and give pro and cons for those two guys.
