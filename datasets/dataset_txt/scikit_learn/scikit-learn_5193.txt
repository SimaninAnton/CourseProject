The following parameters should be renamed for consistency:
learn_rate in GradientBoosting to learning_rate
n_atoms to n_components (right?) everywhere
max_iters to max_iter in LabelPropagation
chunk_size to batch_size
Renaming means:
Add the new parameter in the same place as the old, move the old parameter to the end of the parameter list.
Set the default value of the old parameter to None, check if it was set, and if so, raise a deprecation warning.
