Imagine you had a lot of columns, but that some of those columns never changed or were duplicated due to any number of circumstances. You might not even notice that you have these useless columns. It would be nice to have an optional preprocessing function that warns you about columns that would add no new information to the training, and optionally, trim those columns. Algorithms like build_tree still have to consider those columns, and it gets expensive. Apologies if this is not the place for my comment.
