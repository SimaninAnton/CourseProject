Description
scikit-learn gets a lot of doc changes, and we often want to ensure that they look right after being built. When we ask contributors to "show us how it looks when it's built", many do not know that circleci automatically builds the docs and that they see a live version in the build artifacts. Perhaps we should put a note about this somewhere in the contributing docs?
