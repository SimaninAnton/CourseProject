Recently there was a bug in error reporting and I found several unreachable code-path.
This makes me think that it would be good to have 100% code coverage (in not backported modules). I think this is not really hard to do.
I would also like to cover all the value errors. Simply for the reason that this makes it much easier to find not covered places.
If the coverage utility tells me 98% is covered, I have to go to the source every time to see if the missing lines are if C < 0 raise ValueError or something that really should be tested.
