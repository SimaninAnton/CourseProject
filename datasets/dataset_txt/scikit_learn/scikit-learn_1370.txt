Description
The section on logistic regression in the user guide mentions an intercept term c in the cost function and does not include c in the penalization term. However, the class documentation states:
Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization as all other features.
If this is true, then c should probably be included in that penalization term.
