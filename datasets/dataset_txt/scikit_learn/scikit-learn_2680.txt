For datasets that are associated to a CSV file, I'd like to suggest adding a "filename" attribute to the data Bunch returned. This would enable demoing using something like pandas to load the data during a tutorial, and hence hopefully help people understanding how to get their data in scikit-learn.
Steps:
Add the filename attribute to load_iris, load_boston, load_breast_cancer
Add a data_filename, target_filename to load_diabetes, load_linnerud
Add this attribute to the docstring of each function
Add an example of loading the data with np.loadtxt in the tutorials, typically where load_iris is used. Also point to pandas with a quick remark (and a link) at this place.
