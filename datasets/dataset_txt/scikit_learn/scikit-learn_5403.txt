This is about the "documentation inaccuracy" and the discussion on "scale_C".
I really want to fix this before the release but I don't have much time atm.
As far as I understood, at the moment we can agree that having "C" as parameter with "scale_C=True"
is not perfect, as this doesn't agree with how "C" is used in the literature / other software.
I am not sure if there was a solution that we could agree on.
I would like to have votes pro/con having a "duplicate" parameter C (which has scale_C=False semantics) and alpha, which behaves as in the other linear models. Another option would be to have just the "alpha" parameter.
Any other suggestions are welcome.
I created this script: https://gist.github.com/2354823 to understand the effect of "scale_C".
Not sure if that helps.
Results look like this:


These are grid searches for C=2**k with "shuffle & split" and different fractions of training data.
In principle the results should just be shifted by a factor of "n_samples". Guess that is not a power of two so that makes it a bit different. Not sure I like one more than the other.
