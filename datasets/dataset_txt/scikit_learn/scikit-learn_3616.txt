In sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_forest.py, we have the following test
def test_dtype_convert():
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
    CLASSES = 15
    X = np.eye(CLASSES)
    y = [ch for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU'[:CLASSES]]

    result = classifier.fit(X, y).predict(X)
    assert_array_equal(result, y)
This test is unstable and fails sometimes. There are two issues: the random_state is not fixed
and the test fails probably due to the bootstrap.
