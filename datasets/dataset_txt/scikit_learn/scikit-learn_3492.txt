Look at dual problem, it states that each element of Q matrix is K(x_i, x_j), and it seems wrong, because it should be multiplied by y_i and y_j.
Or in other case, if we assume that alpha_i = alpha_i * y_i, "subject to" section for that formulation becomes wrong.
Just look at wiki formulation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Dual_form_2
Can somebody check this? Looks like i'm right.
