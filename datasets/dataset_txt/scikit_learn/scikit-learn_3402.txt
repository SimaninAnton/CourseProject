when i run the project on the webpage: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_partial_dependence.html#example-ensemble-plot-partial-dependence-py
i try to change the value of 'grid_resolution', which is the parameter of function 'partial_dependence()',
i find and can not understand the following situation:
the original value of grid_resolution is 50, when changed to values less than 50, then, the shape of x_axis and y_axis are both (50, 50). the project works well,
but do not work while bigger than 50. for example, grid_resolution = 100, the x_axis.shape = (52, ), y_axis = (100, ), and pdp.shape = (1, 5200). it directly cause the value of XX, YY not equal to each other, and the leads to the error"ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape".
why can not set tgrid_resolution to any value( > 0) as i want???
thanks!!
