This is probably a very naive question, but I haven't been able to assign weights for specific samples.
Specifically, I have two root files (signal and background) which I transform into arrays using 'root2array'. These sample are then concatenated using 'X = np.concatenate((signal, backgr))'. The problem is that for the signal samples I have some weights that I calculated event-by-event that I want to be consider in the training. My understanding is that weights should be passed in the method method.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=weights). However, these samples are already the combined ones, so obviously there is a mismatch between the number of samples.
There is any way that I could assign the weights only for the signal samples?
Thanks!
