Hi
I would like to propose an addition in the scikit - learn ML algorithm:: heat diffusion on un-directed weighted graph
It is used in a semi-supervised setup and can be used at problems requiring local and global scales of information using some sort of label transfer but not limited to this
Graph Diffusion based transductive learning is finding many applications such as in Page Rank Algorithms , Web graph mining algorithms among others
The basic idea of the algorithm requires a graph based setup to be induced on the data using some kind of similarity measure. Then the graph laplacian is calculated and its eigendecomposition gives us the eigenvectors and eigenvalues' matrix. Now using the first k eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors we know that we can divide the data into k clusters but we can do more than that. We can change the eigenvalues' matrix exponentially with time and recompute the final distribution of the label for each data point if initial label distribution of data is given. If this is done for different scales(exponent values) we get local and global diffusion of the labels in the whole dataset. And thus we can exploit the result as we wish.
Mathematically, most of it can be explained via ::
G(V,E,W) <--- graph with V nodes E edges and W weights on the edges
f(0) <--- inital label distribution of data at time 0
L = D - W <--- laplacian equals degree matrix - weight matrix
L = U M U' <--- U eigen vector matrix and M is the corresponding eigenvalue matrix
H(t) = U e^Mt U' <-- here H(t) is the diffusion matrix at time t
f(t) = H(t) f(0) <-- f(t) reresents final distribution at time t
of course the setup here needs to be transductive

I have a basic working code(see https://gist.github.com/halwai/9f4c5f9af3e9fd20e699) for the same which i have recently coded for a project i was working on and would like to contribute
