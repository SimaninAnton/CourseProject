I read the following and got a question about it.
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/performance.html#a-sample-algorithmic-trick-warm-restarts-for-cross-validation
What kind of parameters will the algorithm "warm restart"? Will they parameters to be tuned be "warm restarted"? Or is it the starting solution of any iterative optimization algorithm (e.g. the "w" vector of gradient descent as in w^T * x = b for linear regression) that will be "warm started"?
By speaking "warm start", I mean the optimal parameters/solution trained in one fold will be used as the initial parameters/solution in the next fold.
P.S. Someone asked the same question on SO but not many people replied. So I hoped developers of sklearn may be able to help. Thank you so much.
