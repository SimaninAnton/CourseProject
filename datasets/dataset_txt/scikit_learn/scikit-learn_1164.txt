We are currently downloading data from openml.org and storing it in gzipped files. We do not request that the data come gzipped (AFAIK), but most HTTP servers would facilitate this. We could request gzip-compressed data, reducing download time and avoiding a round trip when cache=True. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3947120
