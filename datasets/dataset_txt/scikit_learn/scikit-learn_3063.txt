hi,
the code in http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_lda_qda.html
does not draw the ellipse!
i comment out "plot_qda_cov(qda, splot)" and "plot_lda_cov(qda, splot)" in the for loop at the end of the file, and get the figure as same as which i do nothing, that means those two function does not draw the ellipse as they should!
