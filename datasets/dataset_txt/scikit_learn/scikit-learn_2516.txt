Description
Hi, I am using sklearn to compute the adjusted mutual information for the given pair of variables. It is wired that I got "nan" instead of 1 when I computed the adjusted mutual information for the same vector x. A screenshot will be attached below. The data X.txt will be also attached as X.txt
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn import metrics
import numpy as np
x = np.loadtxt('X.txt')
metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(x,x)
Expected Results
metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(x,x) should be 1.
Actual Results
