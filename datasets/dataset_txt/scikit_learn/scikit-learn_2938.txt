@jmetzen thank you for contributing the new Gaussian Process module, it is really helpful! I wondered if it is possible to specify the input dimension(s) each kernel should be applied to? For example, if my input is 3-dimensional and I would like a kernel setup like this:
kernel =   rational quadratic kernel on input dimension 2
         * RBF kernel on input dimension 3
         + periodic kernel on input dimensions 1 and 2
Could this be achieved with the current state of the API?
