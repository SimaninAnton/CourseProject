It would be great to get a new travis entry to run the tests on macOS. In order to spare resource I think it's fine to just test with the latest stable version of Python 3, numpy, scipy and cython.
It not trivial to build and test Python projects under OSX. The matthew-brett/multibuild scripts can help a lot to get this working although as we don't need to support every possible version of Python / numpy / scipy combo, I think it would be fine to hardcode stuff in our own scripts under build_tools/travis.
