Hi:
I use the sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis to handle multi-class classification problem. When I want to analyze the result of resulting model, I find there is no mention about what's the multi-class classification strategy used in sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis. Is it one-over-rest or one-over-one?
Another thing is about when it comes to one-over-one, how can I know the resulting decision function is for which one over which one? For example, if there three classes, 0, 1, and 2, when I extract the _coef of the model, what's the order of coefficients of decision function? 0-1, 0-2, 1-2, or 0-1, 1-2, 0-2.... or any kind of combinations.
