Grettings.
I have recently stumbled upon something that needs to be clarified, because there is a supposition that the parameter does not work as intended.
Description
As it is written in the documentation, warm_start is a bool and thus receives True or False statements. If it is set to True, then it reuses the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, it just erases the previous solution. So, if the 'warm_start' parameter is False, each weight (coef_) is set to zero. I have opened the coordinate_descent.py and found the code concerning the definition:
if not self.warm_start or self.coef_ is None:
    coef_ = np.zeros((n_targets, n_features), dtype=X.dtype,
            order='F')
else:
    coef_ = self.coef_
    if coef_.ndim == 1:
            coef_ = coef_[np.newaxis, :]
It basically should mean the following: if self.set_warm is True, then coef_ = self.coef_. Though, it does not happen. Let me introduce the basic example in the section below.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
warm_start = [True, False]
n_targets = 1  # column of labels in data
n_features = 5  #  number of feature columns in data
coefs = np.array([-1., 2., 3., 10., 12.])  # weights after first fit

for bool in warm_start:
    if not bool is None:  # statements similar to the one above
        coef_ = np.zeros((n_targets, n_features), dtype=X.dtype, order='F')
        print('{}\nset coef_ to zeros by default'.format(coef_))
    else:
        coef_ = coefs
        print('{}\nset coef_ to the ones of the previous fit'.format(coef_))
The code is ultra-easy but produces the same result regardless of the bool value.
Expected Results
[-1 2 3 10 12]
set coef_ to the ones of the previous fit
[[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
set coef_ to zeros by default
Actual Results
[[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
set coef_ to zeros by default
[[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
set coef_ to zeros by default
