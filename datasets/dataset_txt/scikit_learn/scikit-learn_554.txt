Hi all,
I am trying to compute PCA using sklearn.decomposition.PCA that seems that it uses correlation matrix I would like instead to use covariance matrix to compute the principal components.
I ask a question on StackOverflow two years ago but I get no answer.
I think it's a very important feature see also this question on Crossvalidated StackExchange site.
Thanks and all the best!
Giacomo
