Hi,
I want to try on some customize loss function in my data, and find the SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor in sklearn.
It's definitely a good framework to try my own loss function. I dig into the code, find the sgdclassifier source code, and the loss function source codeNote that every loss function derived from a base class LossFunction, which is an interface that implements loss and dloss.
Till now it only accepts a string to refer to pre-defined loss functions(i.e. ‘hinge’ or ‘log’ or ‘modified_huber’). I believe I not the only one who would like to try new loss functions on dataset. I suggest to modify the SGDClassfier/Regressor, so that its loss parameter accepts an instance of customize lossfunction, as well as a string to refer to pre-defined lossfunctions.
