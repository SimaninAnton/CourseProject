So, previously I raised an issue for applying DBSCAN on string data #3737
Using those suggestion, I am able to use DBSCAN clustering with Levenshtein distance.
Now the problem is that calculating Levenshetein distance is O(l^2) with llength of strings. So, if I have a large dataset, then applying DBSCAN requires N^2 pairwise distance computations.
Is there any way to apply Ball-tree / KD-tree to benefit from fast nearest neighbors search even for string data where distance is Levenshtein distance?
