Affinity clustering works by computing matrices of availability (of each point as a cluster exemplar) and responsibility (for each point as a cluster member). However, these matrices are not stored in AffinityPropagation nor are they returned by affinity_propagation.
I am not an expert, but I have been using affinity clustering with some success, but am interested in identifying points with with ambiguous/tenuous membership, and it seemed like examining these matrices (responsibility in particular) might be of interest for that purpose.
If reasonable, it seems like a straightforward solution would be to add A and R to the return values of the function (perhaps optionally, as is currently done for the number of iterations before convergence) and store them as parameters availability_ and responsibility_ in the object.
Cheers!
