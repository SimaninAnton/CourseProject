Estimators like LinearRegression, Ridge, RandomizedLogisticRegression have normalize option to scale features, which can in some cases lead to a better model been built. LogisticRegression doesn't have such option so far.
Of cause normalization can be done prior to fitting estimator, so question is, if it makes sense to add normalize as part of LogisticRegression constructor?
