It would be nice if scikit-learn showed which lines are covered by unit tests in our PRs. For example, Coveralls will show your test coverage line by line.
I got the idea by my company's code review tool Phabricator. Phabricator shows the line by line coverage in your code changes:
It might help prevent and address issues like #4134 and #7698 .
