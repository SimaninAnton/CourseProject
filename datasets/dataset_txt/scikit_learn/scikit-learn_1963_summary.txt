Hi everyone, i am working on speech recognition project. i have extracted the features from voice to set an input for hmm. But now i am confused either go for https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn (Guassian HMM) or go for my own. And if i am building my own, which resource should i use to make my hmm work correctly. Note that it is my final year project. And help/suggestion would be more than welcome.
