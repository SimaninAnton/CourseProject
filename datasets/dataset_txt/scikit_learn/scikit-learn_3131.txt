Currently, there are four badges at the top of the sklearn repo README, and all of them communicate useful information about the build status and test coverage. It would also be useful to have badges for other things, such as the Python versions that are supported by the package (2.7, 3.5), a link to the latest PyPi package and its version, a link to the docs, the software license for the repo, and the code quality according to landscape.io. Below is an example of what some of these badges look like.
I would be happy to submit a PR that includes many of these badges, although a repo owner would likely have to set up landscape.io (the code quality checker). Please let me know if this is a contribution you'd consider.
