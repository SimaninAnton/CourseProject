Including "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer" in my program causes it to throw "DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found." (It happens if I import TfidfTransformer as well.)
According to the error message, the problem is when "from . import text" is called from __ init __.py which leads to a problem when it tries to "import unicodedata."
I am running Python 2.7.2 via the latest release of Enthought (7.3-1, 64bit). I am happy to provide anymore information/logs/etc.
