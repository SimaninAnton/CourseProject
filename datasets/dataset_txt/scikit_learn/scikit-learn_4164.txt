Some of our common tests could be transformed into reusable functions. This would allow third-party developers to run a battery of tests on their estimator to check whether it is scikit-learn compatible. In a way, we can see these tests as a way of writing our API specification directly in Python language.
Things that come to mind:
test if clonable
test if can be pickled
test if accepts lists
tests that fit with sparse matrices either work or raises a TypeError
etc...
