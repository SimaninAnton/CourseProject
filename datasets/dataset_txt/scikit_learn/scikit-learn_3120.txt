Would the sklearn team be amenable to adding an update checker to the package?
Essentially, the update checker would run only once every session that a user uses sklearn. It would check their local version of sklearn and compare it to the latest version on PyPi, and output a short message to stdout indicating that their version is out of date and can be updated (if it is).
This check could be overridden by passing an ignore_update_check parameter.
