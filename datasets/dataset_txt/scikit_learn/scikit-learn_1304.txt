Description
Lasso Regression gives inconsistent results depending on the ordering of the feature columns of the training matrix.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
https://gist.github.com/cod3licious/672f80c47a1d1d6a90629622d7c1d022
Expected Results
Lasso fitted on the same matrix with permuted columns should assign similar coefficients for the same features (as it is the case for linear/ridge regression).
Actual Results
While with one ordering of the columns (important columns near the beginning of the matrix, but I'm not sure if that is relevant) the model finds the correct coefficients, with a permuted order of the columns, the results are completely messed up.
