The labels parameter to precision_recall_fscore_support is described in the docstring as "array of labels". Things that are unclear to me:
it is only tested with permutations of the range of labels. In this case, it only applies to average=None and that should be stated.
may it be used to limit the set of labels used? if so, this affects other averages, but really must be tested for all and documented.
