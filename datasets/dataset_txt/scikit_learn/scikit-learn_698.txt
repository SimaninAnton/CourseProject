It seems that the documentation for max_iter is wrong in the docstring of LogisticRegression: the documentation claims that the parameter is not passed to saga and liblinear.
max_iter is clearly passed to saga.
From a cursory look at the code, it seems that it is also passed to liblinear.
The documentation should be fixed, including checking what liblinear actually does, and maybe a test should be written.
