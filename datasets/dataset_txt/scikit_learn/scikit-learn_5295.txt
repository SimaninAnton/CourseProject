If you search for something like "Lasso L1 scikit-learn", and look at the versions of the documentation for the top results:
0.11
Dev
0.5
0.8
0.11
0.6
It's incredibly distracting (not to mention confusing) to see old documentation here. You should tell Google not to index old versions and have a "current" symlink that is the only one indexed.
Alternatively, if you can't do that - please add a "NOT THE CURRENT VERSION" banner and a button to redirect to current documentation. However, I strongly prefer the "only index stable" approach...
