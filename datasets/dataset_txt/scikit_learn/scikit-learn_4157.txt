The documentation for this project looks fantastic. I'm new to ML but I'd love to have a PDF copy of the docs which I can read along with text books on the subject.
I just spend half a day trying to do 'make latexpdf' only to find out that pdf functionality hasn't worked in over a year.
Can you please just provide a pdf copy of the manual and save lots of people lots of time and frustration. Even the sourceforge email lists are full of people asking for the pdf.
