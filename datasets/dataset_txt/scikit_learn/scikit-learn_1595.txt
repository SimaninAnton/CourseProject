Hello,
The Nystroem transformation formulas in the scikit-learn implementation is not the same than the original ones. I wonder why? For a formal view of the actual formulas, check here where I already posted this question but didn't get any answer.
I am not sure it is a good place for such a question, if not, I am sorry.
