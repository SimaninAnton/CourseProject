I'm trying to store a database of model metrics in a selection process, and it would be nice to have a way to create a unique ID for the model pipeline associated with each prediction, including initialisation parameters and fit parameters. It doesn't need to include the actual parameters in the ID - a hash would be fine, but I've tried hashing a pipeline with hash(), and it doesn't seem to produce a constant has for a given pipeline. Anyone have any better ideas?
