So I just talked to someone at vw and their tests broke upgrading to 0.18.
They imported the NotFittedError from the old location and checked that it was raised by an estimator. The estimator raised the new one now though, so the test fails.
Inverting the inheritance relation should fix this, but that would break people raising the old one and using our check_estimator, I think. So I'm not sure what to do.
