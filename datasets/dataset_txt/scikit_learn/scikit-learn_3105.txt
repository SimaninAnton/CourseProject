I am wondering why the ellipse sizes in all mixture examples are computed as the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
In the case of a diagonal covariance matrix for instance, the eigenvalues correspond to the variances.
However, if we scale the data by 10, the variances are scaled by 100 and the ellipses get way too large.
A better value for ellipse sizes would be proportional to standard deviation, e.g.
2 sqrt(2) sqrt(eigenvalues),
which correspond to the contour where the probability is 1/e times the max probability of the gaussian.
This problem appears in the following examples:
plot_gmm.py
plot_gmm_covariances.py
plot_gmm_selection.py
plot_gmm_sin.py
