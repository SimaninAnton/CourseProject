I have been using the linear model of the scikitlearn package (Logistic regression in particular). I have observed that there was a dependent variable was constant in my training data. Thus the variable is playing the role of the intercept, with the value of the true intercept distributed between amongst the intercept term and the variables coefficient. Thus intercept value is altered. Such variables affect the regularization too. Ideally such variable coefficients should be forced to zero.
