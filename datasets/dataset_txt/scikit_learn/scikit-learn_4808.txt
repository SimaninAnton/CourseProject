When I increased the n_estimators to 1000, the train score, suddenly, jumped to a large number as follows:
...
built tree 723 of 1000, train score = 1.318154e-01
built tree 724 of 1000, train score = 1.317394e-01
built tree 725 of 1000, train score = 1.317101e-01
built tree 726 of 1000, train score = 6.835322e+12
built tree 727 of 1000, train score = 6.835322e+12
built tree 728 of 1000, train score = 6.835322e+12
built tree 729 of 1000, train score = 6.835322e+12
built tree 730 of 1000, train score = 6.835322e+12
...
and kept 6.835322e+12 with no change.
Thanks
