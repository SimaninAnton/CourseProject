As we get more and more newbie users, it might be good to have some more basic info in the tutorials / examples.
Here: http://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn/forums/t/3986/welcome/21252#post21252
was a question for a explanation of cross-validation.
Currently the docs only cover how to do cross-validation with sklearn, not really what cross-validation does (or I didn't find it).
I think it would be in the scope of the docs to explain the general approach.
