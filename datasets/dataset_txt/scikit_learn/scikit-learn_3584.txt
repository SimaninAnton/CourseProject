Hey,
I am trying to create a MetaEstimator class with parameters 'algorithm' which is a type of estimator and 'parameters' which is a dictionary of parameters for the 'algorithm' estimator. However I come across this error when I try to use this class in conjunction with bagging. Does anyone have any suggested workarounds, fixes, or ways to redesign the class?
In file sklearn/base.py line 33 it says that cloning cannot handle dictionaries.
Thanks!
Snippet of code:
def clone(estimator, safe=True):
"""Constructs a new estimator with the same parameters.
Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator
without actually copying attached data. It yields a new estimator
with the same parameters that has not been fit on any data.

Parameters
----------
estimator: estimator object, or list, tuple or set of objects
    The estimator or group of estimators to be cloned

safe: boolean, optional
    If safe is false, clone will fall back to a deepcopy on objects
    that are not estimators.

"""
estimator_type = type(estimator)
# XXX: not handling dictionaries
if estimator_type in (list, tuple, set, frozenset):
    return estimator_type([clone(e, safe=safe) for e in estimator])
elif not hasattr(estimator, 'get_params'):
    if not safe:
