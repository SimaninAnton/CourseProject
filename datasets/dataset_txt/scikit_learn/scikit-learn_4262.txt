ElasticNetCV crashes for high dimensional data, whereas for the same data ElasticNet seems to work perfect. (I have a laptop with a 8GB RAM)
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized
datasets = fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized()
X, y = datasets.data, datasets.target
y[y!=1] = -1
# This works fine
clf = ElasticNet()
clf.fit(X, y)
# This crashes, though i'm fitting just one model, i.e equivalent of ElasticNet
clf = ElasticNetCV(n_alphas=1)
clf.fit(X, y)
I shall try and fix this.
