Description
The documentation for DensityMixin class is missing.
However, the class actually exists and even BaseMixture class inherits DensityMixin.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Checking out API Reference documentation source, I find that DensityMixin is missing.
Versions
On the master branch.
I think adding a proper documentation wouldn't be a big deal, and I would like to contribute if you all think it is needed.
