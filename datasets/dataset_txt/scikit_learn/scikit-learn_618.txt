Hello,
I want to compute the features importance of a dataset, using Random forest. The number of features is around 120 for 200k samples. The number of trees I set is 30 and the depth is also 30 (because I got good F1 scores with these parameters).
Since, there is some randomness in the algorithm (random forest), I'm varying the random state parameter over a loop of 100 iterations with different random state values. For each iteration I calculate the features importance, then at the end I just make a final average.
My questions are:
1 - Varying this random state value each time and then calculate an average is not just an equivalent way of setting a constant random state value and just increase the number of trees (1000 rather than 30) ?
2 - for 120 features, how many trees do I need ?
Thanks in advance and lot for your help
