Hello,
I am doing a nlp project and reading the documentation of TfidfTransformer.
However, it is a bit unclear for me that does the TfidfTransformer accept a Term-Document matrix, or a Document-Term matrix? In other words, does the n_samples refer to the number of terms or documents?
In this case, is it a better idea to clarify this in the documentation?
Thank you in advance for your time.
