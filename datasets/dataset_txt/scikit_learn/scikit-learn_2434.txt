The way that Lars is currently described it's pretty unclear what problem it's solving:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/linear_model.html#least-angle-regression
My understanding is that it finds an unregularized least squares solution, with the option to stop the path early and get a somewhat greedy selection of nonzero-coefficients.
Given the flow of the docs with Lars coming just after ElasticNet, that seems pretty unclear.
[Also, I have no idea where the n_nonzero_coefs=500 comes from]
