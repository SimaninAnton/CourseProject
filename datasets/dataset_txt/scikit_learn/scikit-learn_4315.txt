Currently, the metrics.py module is becoming huge and contains 2345 lines. It becomes difficult to enter in the module to newcomers. I propose to split sklearn.metrics.metrics
in
sklearn.metrics.classification which would contains all classification metrics without score involved
sklearn.metrics.regression which would contains all regression metrics
sklearn.metrics.ranking or sklearn.metrics.threshold which would contains all classification metrics with a score involved.
The sklearn/metrics/tests/test_metrics.py, which contains 2710 lines, would be split in 4 testing files:
sklearn/metrics/tests/test_invariance.py with invariance tests and common tests to all metrics
sklearn/metrics/tests/test_classification.py
sklearn/metrics/tests/test_regression.py
sklearn/metrics/tests/test_ranking.py or sklearn/metrics/tests/test_threshold.py
What do you think?
