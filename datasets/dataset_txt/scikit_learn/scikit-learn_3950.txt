Would it be useful to other if train_test_split was able to take a stratified sample like so
>>> train_test_split([1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2], test_size=0.5, stratified=True)
Out[2]: [[1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2]]
instead of a random sample, as it currently does:
>>> train_test_split([1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2], test_size=0.5)
Out[1]: [[2, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 2]]
