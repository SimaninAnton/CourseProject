I tried to use class_prior when doing an out-of-core learning using the partial_fit method on a MultinomialNB classifier, but it seems like the prior probabilities are not taken into account at all.
So I checked the code of the BaseDiscreteNB and it really seems like the class_prior is never taken into account when using the partial_fit method. Is this done intentionally or is it a bug?
If it is not a bug, can you please document why class_prior shouldn't and wouldn't be taken into account when using partial_fit?
Thanks a lot!
