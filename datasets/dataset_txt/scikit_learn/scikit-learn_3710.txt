Sourceforge seems to have some issues so that the "official" scikit-learn documentation hasn't been reachable for the last couple of days. I am not sure if the mailing list is also affected, which is why I wanted to raise this question here.
I think it would be a good idea to add https://scikit-learn.github.io/dev/ as alternative to "Important Links" section in the README.md in the GitHub repo for such scenarios, what do you think?
