The order of labels of pandas’ categorical features as CategoricalDtype(order=True) might be used by estimators. For example:
print(houses['quality'].unique())
[poor, fair, typical, good, excellent]
Categories (4, object): [poor < fair < typical < good < excellent]
Note how order is embedded in the data type above.
I was expecting codes like these:
0 poor
1 fair
2 typical
3 good
4 excellent
And I'm sure estimators would provide more meaningful results if such order was used.
But LabelEncoder gives random integer codes, probably using data as it comes:
3 poor
1 fair
0 typical
4 good
2 excellent
Thank you in advance
