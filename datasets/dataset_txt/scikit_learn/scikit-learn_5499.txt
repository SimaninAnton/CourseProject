Sphinx pours out weird errors when trying to document properties.
This does not seem to be a problem when defined using property decorators without prop.setter.
when using foo = property(_getter_foo, _setter_foo)
something goes wrong, though.
If properties are not listed in the "Attributes" section, they are not documented at all.
This is an issue for the hmm and gmm modules.
Without this issue, the doc build errors would be actually readable.
