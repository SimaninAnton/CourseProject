I thought that I had done something wrong, but @agramfort confirmed that each warning prints only once and is later ignored.
For example
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNetCV
clf = ElasticNetCV(max_iter=1)
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
X, y = make_regression()
clf.fit(X, y)
sklearn/linear_model/coordinate_descent.py:512: ConvergenceWarning: Objective 
did   not converge. You might want to increase the number of iterations
ConvergenceWarning)
Should not there be one warning for each alpha here? Also in any script if there are multiple instances of the same warning message, it gets printed only once. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but I do expect a warning for every time for which an alpha fails to converge.
