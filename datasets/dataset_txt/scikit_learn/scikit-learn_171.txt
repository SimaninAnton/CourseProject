from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
import numpy as np

x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'b'
while
x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
works with a warning?
this worked in 0.21.1 without a warning (as I think it should)
Edit by @ogrisel: I removed the .astype(object) in the second code snippet.
