Just saw #1679 again and thought we should add some "conventions" documentation.
I think adding a short paragraph about sklearn rules and expectations to the "quick start guide" would be nice.
It should contain "unless otherwise specified, input will be cast to float64", regression targets will be converted to float64, classification targets can be arbitrary and the same type will be produced again.
Also maybe in the same place say that calling fit will forget any previous models, and maybe that parameters can be set using estimator.parameter = stuff?
I have no other ideas what should be there.
