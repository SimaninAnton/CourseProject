As far as I can tell, these are completely missing.
I feel this makes the multi label classifiers much less useful.
I am not sure what common measure there are but two that seem natural to me would be Hamming loss (how many classes per example were correct?) and 0-1 loss (for how many examples were all classes correct).
At least these are two losses that are commonly used in structured prediction afaik.
