Please execuse my poor English.
My codes is like this:
clf = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0, n_estimators=100,n_jobs=4)
traindataX=StandardScaler().fit_transform(traindataX)
clf=clf.fit(traindataX,traindatay)
traindataX has 16 features and 889054 samples, each feature's value of traindataX is 0~1 before StandardScaler().fit_transform.
My machine has 4GB RAM, intel core i3 2.53GHZ CPU. Win7 64bits.
After about 1 hour's training, I need to predict test samples. But the prediction for a single sample will take about 4 minutes, and the memory is full, the prediction time is too long for me.
Is there any way to optimize the prediction speed of RandomForestRegressor?
Thanks!
