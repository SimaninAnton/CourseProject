Scikit-Learn's hierarchical clustering supports only considering the locality of each point as defined by a connectivity matrix. A nearest neighbors graph might be a good connectivity matrix without other knowledge.
The current approach of supplying a connectivity matrix means that it cannot be used in a pipeline that alters the k nearest neighbors space (and certainly not one that alters the number of samples as in BIRCH's global clustering). Hence it should be possible to supply connectivity as a callable such that connectivity(X) returns a sparse connectivity matrix. (Alternatively, we could allow connectivity to be an integer and kneighbors_graph can be applied directly.)
