When requesting an openml dataset by name, alternative version numbers can give completely different datasets. We need to encourage users to provide a version in such cases. We should:
make the documentation more emphatic about this
when version='active', raise a warning if multiple versions exist, along the lines of "Multiple dataset versions match the name BLAH. Versions may be very different. Getting version x."
