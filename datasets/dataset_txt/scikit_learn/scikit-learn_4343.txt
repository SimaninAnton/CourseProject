In my opinion the organization of modules and naming in scikit-learn seems a little bit unorganized. On the other hand the newly reorganized interface in Orange 2.7 seems much cleaner with an obvious hierarchy and naming. The details will probably change with Orange 3 that is still in its early infancy and will switch to NumPy for data representation.
In case you were planning on refactoring code and improving documentation, I would therefore suggest you check out and maybe get inspiration from http://orange.biolab.si/docs/latest/reference/rst/.
Suggested renaming:
see hierarchical organization in Orange
samples -> instances (to avoid confusion with sampling techniques)
attributes -> features (features is a more general word, but not used everywhere)
estimator -> learner (if it learns a model from the data, it is logical to call it a learner (which is also more general than classifier or regressor))
predictor -> model (after learning you get a model that is capable of making predictions for new data)
model -> evaluation/method scoring (if it is evaluating the goodness of a fit and returning a score, it should not be called something completely different) (also note there are method scoring, feature scoring, and instance scoring/weighting)
