I have my own dist function that takes values from similarity_matrix:
def dist(x, y):
    dist = 0
    for elt_x, elt_y in zip(x, y):
        dist += abs(similarity_matrix[elt_x][elt_y])
    return float(dist)
If I try tree = KDTree(X, metric=dist) I get: ValueError: metric PyFuncDistance is not valid for KDTree. Is there any option to do such thing with KD tree? If not, how to do it with regular KNN?
metric = sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric.get_metric('pyfunc', func=dist) and then tree = KDTree(X, metric=metric) gives me the same error.
