SVC has a decision_function of a non-standard shape. We should fix that by aggregating all the decision values that belong to one class, or something similar. We could also use the we could also use the somewhat odd formula in the OvO classifier that uses a mixture of votes and decision function to make sure it is consistent with predict.
We should add a parameter controlling whether the decision function is aggregated or raw.
