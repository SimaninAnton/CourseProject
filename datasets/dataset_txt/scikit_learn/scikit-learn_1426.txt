Right now it says it's only used for non-scipy distributions, but if the scipy version is newer than 0.16 it's actually used for the scipy distributions as well.
Slightly related: we don't check if someone passes a custom rvs object if it has a random_state argument and possibly fail, right? Maybe that's fine, though we should definitely document it!
