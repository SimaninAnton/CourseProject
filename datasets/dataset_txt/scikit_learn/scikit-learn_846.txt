Description
Wanted to start contributing to scikit-learn. Then, I followed the Way to contribute section, but I failed while running the example scripts. I posted a question on stackOverflow to get an answer. The result was I did not get the good installation method.
May be a reminder of Building the library from source + editable installation could be added in the documentation to make a complete recipe.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Follow actual documentation
Expected Results
Following the "how to contribute" section of the documentation provide working dev environment
Actual Results
Installation method as editable from source is missing to completely work
Versions
scikit-learn v0.20.1
