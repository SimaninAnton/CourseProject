from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
le.fit(["apple", "orange"]
In old versions of NumPy
le.transform("apple")
"y contains new labels: [a p l e]" % str(diff)
In new versions of NumPy
le.transform("apple")
0
The fix should be as simple as calling column_or_1d as the start of transform
