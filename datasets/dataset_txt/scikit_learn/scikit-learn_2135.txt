Raykov et al (2016) presents a neat-looking clustering algorithm that is apparently quite good, relative to a few other clustering methods tested. I'm not really convinced that the synthetic datasets are good examples, but the algorithm doesn't look too inefficient, and look like it might be a good fit in scikit-learn.
I probably won't have time to try this out, and I think it's not currently useful to me, but I figured it's a good idea to let people know, in case someone else wants to try it. There's already a Matlab implementation included in the supplementary material that can serve as a guide.
