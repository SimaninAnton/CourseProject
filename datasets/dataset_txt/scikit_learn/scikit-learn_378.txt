Hello,
I am trying to generate a logistic regression model using SGDClassifier, which should be pre-trained on a large dataset, and then learn new data incrementally/online.
I am using SGDClassifier's fit() and partial_fit() methods for the required logic.
My question is, as I cannot find anything related to this topic in the documentation:
Does SGDClassifier (Logistic regression in this case) suffer from catastrophic forgetting (e.g. does it forget previously trained data) if I incrementally extend the model using partial_fit()?
