Hello, in the doc (stable or dev version) here we can read:
Load the 20 newsgroups dataset and transform it into tf-idf vectors.
This is a convenience function; the tf-idf transformation is done using the default settings for sklearn.feature_extraction.text.Vectorizer.
But in the source:
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(dtype=np.int16)
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(data_train.data).tocsr()
X_test = vectorizer.transform(data_test.data).tocsr()
It's not a TfidfVectorizer isn't it ?
