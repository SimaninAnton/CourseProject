crfsuite probably the fastest linear chain CRF implementation,
written in pure C with the "Right License" and features sgd optimizer and optional sparse priors.
This is probably a major task to do a correct wrapping. In addition it will require a quite a bit of wise thinking to come up with a simple yet expressive pythonic API to be able to deal with structured output in a efficient and numpy friendly manner.
