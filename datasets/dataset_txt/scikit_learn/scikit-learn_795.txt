Hello,
I'm using the feature importance method of Random forest. So, based on that, I rank my features increasingly/decreasingly according to their importance value.
The problem is: at each execution I obtain different values i.e. a feature that has been highly ranked in the first execution would be misclassified in the second. Hence, I get totally confused about the reel importance of my features, since the ranking is changing at each execution.
So please, could you explain me what is happening ? Perhaps the data is randomized/shuffled differently at each execution and consequently the feature contribution rate changes from an execution to another ? How this could be interpreted ? How it could be fixed ?
Thanks in advance for your answers/discussion
