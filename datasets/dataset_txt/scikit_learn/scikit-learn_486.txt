Regularly we have to change a lot of the doctests, in particular pretty unrelated parts, because we change default parameters.
I would argue that it would be better to use print_changed_only for all the doctests. That would have the positive effect of removing this extra overhead for devs.
It would also have the benefit of making examples more concise and easier to understand. If we demonstrate the setting of a particular parameter, it's easy to miss that particular parameter (or maybe it's hidden in the ellipsis even).
We can probably add a global fixture for this somewhere if we decide to do that.
