Description
I suggest adding another metric for multi-class classifiers which I have recently implemented - multi-class AUC. It is a natural extension of the well known and widely used AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) metric, which is defined for only binary classifiers. This measure was introduced in the paper 'Hand, David J., and Robert J. Till. "A simple generalization of the area under the ROC curve for multiple class classification problems." Machine learning 45, no. 2 (2001): 171-186'. It is widely used as the original paper currently has 1435 citation. Multi-class AUC reduces to the standard AUC in case of two classes.
