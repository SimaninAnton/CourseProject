I have a data set including user ID, item ID, and rating as below:
user ID     item ID    rating
 1233        1011       4
 1220        0999       3
 2011        0702       1
 ...
When I split them into train and test sets:
from sklearn import cross_validation

train, test = cross_validation.train_test_split(df, test_size = 0.2)
Whether the users in test set have already appeared in the train set, and so have items? If not, how can I do that? Thank you in advance!
