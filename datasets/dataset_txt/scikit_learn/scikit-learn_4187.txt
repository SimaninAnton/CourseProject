Currently, sections 1.4.4.2 and 1.4.4.3 of the docs (Nearest neighbors: KDTree and BallTree) contains links to the docs to the KDTree and BallTree classes, respectively. But both of these pages are essentially empty, except for the comment that they are (both!?) aliases for BinaryTree -- which is quite confusing as they are (AFAICT) different (and BinaryTree isn't even documented either).
