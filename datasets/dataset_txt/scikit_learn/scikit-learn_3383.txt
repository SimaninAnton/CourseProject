Apparently NearestNeighbors can be paralleled with n_jobs argument, but when used on Isomap, it is never called with the n_jobs argument, leaving it with the default value 1:
On Isomap._fit_transform method (isomap.py, line 109):
kng = kneighbors_graph(self.nbrs_, self.n_neighbors,
                               mode='distance')
And on kneighbors_graph function (graph.py, line 111):
X = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors, metric=metric, p=p,
                             metric_params=metric_params).fit(X)
Can't Isomap.__init__ method take the n_jobs argument and propagate it to NearestNeighbors class?
