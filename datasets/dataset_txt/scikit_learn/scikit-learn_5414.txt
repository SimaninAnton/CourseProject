When pickle-ing a LogisticRegression model in 0.11, it has a backwards compatibility error when trying to use it in 0.10.
Did the following:
Created a LogisticRegression model in 0.11 (simple, L2 with C=10), fit() it and pickled.
Load the model in 0.11 and tried to "predict()".
Got an exception saying that the object instance does not have a property:
class_weight_label
