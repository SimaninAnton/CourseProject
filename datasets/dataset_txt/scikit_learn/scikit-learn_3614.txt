Following discussions in #5141 we may want to collapse RandomizedPCA as an alternative solver into PCA with a svd_solver='auto' that would use randomized_svd whenever n_components + n_oversamples < 0.8 * min(n_samples, n_features).
This reflects the implementation of fbpca. People may not know that RandomizedPCA exists or when it makes sense to use it.
