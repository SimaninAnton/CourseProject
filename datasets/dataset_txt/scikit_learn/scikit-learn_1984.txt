As discussed on the mailing list, estimators run on complex data without error but might produce wrong results.
We should either raise explicit error messages or ensure correctness in each case.
I think as a first step we should error everywhere, and then enable on an estimator basis.
Do we want to add yet another flag to check_array and check_X_y? That seems the easiest way, though there's already a lot of logic in there....
