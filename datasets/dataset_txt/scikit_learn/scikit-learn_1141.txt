Ordinal logistic regression (the proportional odds model) is a nice set of models that allow for the classification of ordered categories using the same machinery as binary logistic regression. As far as I know these models aren't implemented outside the specialized mord package, and I think they could make a nice addition to the sklearn arsenal. The implementation is fairly straightforward, with estimation being done by maximum likelihood (gist below; there's a minor constraint on the parameters which can be rewritten so that the problem becomes unconstrained), which can also take a penalized form, and so it should be possible to reuse a lot of existing code. Is there any way these could be included, and if so, what's the best way to do so (creating new classes, or just extending existing ones)?
