In the example given in page
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/compose/plot_column_transformer.html
the function classification_report is called with wrong parameters (ordering).
For classification_report the first parameter is the ground truth and the second parameters is the predictions. However in the example the arguments are swapped.
Should I fix it ?
