We have tons of LaTeX warnings when generating PDF. Would really appreciate if someone can help us figure out the reason and fix them (either all of them or part of them).
See e.g, https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/30136/output/104/0?file=true for the log from Circle CI (8313 LaTeX wanings)
#7073 might be a reference.
