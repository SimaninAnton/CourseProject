Not sure if we had this discussion before, and I know that the CountVectorizer regex went through a lot of testing so far. But I think it would be nice to have a way to not split on apostrophes, as they are so common in English. Not sure if it makes a giant difference for unigrams, but I think it might for n-grams.
Changing the default value might be a bit much but we could at least point it out in the docs. Thoughts?
