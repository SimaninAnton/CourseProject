Reported initially in joblib/joblib#263.
The long term fix is to use dill in joblib to be able to pickle functions by value instead of by reference (with recurse=True).
I think we should revert to the default fork server mode for now. We need to release 0.9.3 with that stopgap and re-sync into scikit-learn and backport to 0.17.X before the release.
