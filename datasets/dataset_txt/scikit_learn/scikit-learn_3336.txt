I think my snappy formulation of the FAQ makes is unhelpful.
Maybe the "can I add a new algorithm" and "can I add this old algorithm" section should be summarized into a "what are the inclusion criteria for algorithms".
See http://scikit-learn.org/dev/faq.html#can-i-add-this-new-algorithm-that-i-or-someone-else-just-published
wdyt?
