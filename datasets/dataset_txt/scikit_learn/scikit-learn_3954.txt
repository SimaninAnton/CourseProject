Is there any way to do so? I would like to add an additional penalty factor based on the case if the prediction is higher or lower than the actual. Having sifted through the LinearRegrssion code, it seems to take me to SciPy and then to some precompiled C(?) code.. But maybe I'm not looking in the right place..

Thanks in advance for any hints!
