Dear all,
I would like to inform scikit-learn community about my experience in pickling a vectorizer and a classifier. Each time I read a pickled vectorizer and a pickled classifier, which are a TfidfVectorizer and a Multinomial Naive Bayes objects, I was getting a different result for a test document. After two days of analysis, I discovered that assigning a set() object to the vocabulary parameter of the TfidfVectorizer object makes the features to get random order and let the classifier generate random estimations. After I convert my set of features to a list(), everything become normal.
You may want to take that into consideration in the documentation or code improvements.
Thanks for the great effort you spend for that great project!
