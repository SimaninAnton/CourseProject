Something seemed to have changed in the doctests recently.
MNIST now gets loaded on both of my boxes, meaning I can not really run tests in the background any more. MNIST takes a lot of ram to load and my box started swapping... on my new laptop, the test failed because I war running something else and it threw a memory error.
