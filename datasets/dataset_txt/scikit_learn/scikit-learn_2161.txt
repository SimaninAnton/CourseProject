Following a review for #8222, I saw that a lot of examples were written with some separator to make clearer. It could look like something like:
X = np.random.random((100000, 20))

# Plotting

plt.show(...)
The issue is that those separators are interpreted in sphinx-gallery and transformed to a notebook style which was not intended at first. Therefore, the examples could look slightly sloppy sometimes.
