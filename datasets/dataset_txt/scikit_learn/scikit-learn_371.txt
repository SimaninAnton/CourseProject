I was playing with vectorizers and I found this:
scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
Line 1669 in ae16319
 def transform(self, raw_documents, copy=True): 
However that parameter is not used later in the method.
Here copy=False is used:
scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
Line 1692 in ae16319
 return self._tfidf.transform(X, copy=False) 
Is there anything I am missing?
