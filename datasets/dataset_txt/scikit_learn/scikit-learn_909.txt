Trying to fix warnings in our examples, not sure what to do with this one:
examples/plot_johnson_lindenstrauss_bound.py projects the data which has 64 features into a 300, 1000, and 10000 dimensional space, which results in the following warning:
DataDimensionalityWarning: The number of components is higher than the number of
features: n_features < n_components (64 < 10000).The dimensionality of the problem
will not be reduced.
Which one should we do?
Ignore the warning (warnings.filterwarnings)
Use a sample data with higher dimensions
Project into lower dimensions than 64
Do nothing
