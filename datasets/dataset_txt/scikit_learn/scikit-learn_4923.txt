SpectralClustering supports the RBF kernel, but it could benefit from the generic kernel support in sklearn.metric.pairwise_kernels.
KernelPCA and sklearn.kernel_approximations.Nystroem already do this and provide an example API (kernel_params for callables, custom attributes for the built-in kernels).
