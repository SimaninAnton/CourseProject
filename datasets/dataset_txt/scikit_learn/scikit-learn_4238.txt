Hi,
While doing some package introspection (using this: getattr(__import__('sklearn', fromlist=['*']), module_name)), I found that the modules listed in sklearn's __init__.py __all__ variable were not in sync with the ones that are actually available (for example, 'ensemble' is not in __all__ 's list).
There can be two approaches: auto-generate the __all__ variable by walking the directory and getting available modules (eventually with some exclusions like tests, externals), or completely remove the __all__ variable from __init__.py and let the default behavior happen (all modules not starting with an underscore are made available).
