via #8022.
RandomTreesEmbedding set's 'criterion' and 'max_features' even though they are not init parameters.
Two possible work-arounds: Either make them init parameters (allowing the user to make it not be actually completely random), or adding these two to BaseForest, which would also pacify our tests.
Suggestions?
