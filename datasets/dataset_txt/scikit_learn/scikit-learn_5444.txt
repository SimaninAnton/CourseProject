Hi guys,
Could you please make available on the next release of scikit a version for python x64 on Windows ?
It is a huge pain to build scikit on windows x64. Basically you have to transform windows in linux by installing a lot of linux equivalent tools.It really messes up any machine and in the end it still doesn't work .
Thank's
