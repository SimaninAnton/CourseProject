Folks, i often see such questions on SO:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32945365/tfidf-matrix-returns-wrong-number-of-features-for-bernoullinb/32946634#32946634
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31971761/does-sci-kit-learns-fitx-y-method-work-sequentially-if-not-how-does-it-work/31972193#31972193
And seems that everyone who uses scikit-learn first time don't know answer for such questions, i.e beginners think that if they call fit() couple of times - they would achieve result of partial_fit.
Of course i know that idempotency of fit explained in contributors documentation, but looks like no one reads it at first.
So maybe it makes sense to add some warning into documentation of each fit/fit_transform method?
