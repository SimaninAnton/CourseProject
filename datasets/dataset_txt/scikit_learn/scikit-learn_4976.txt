This might matter for really large datasets as float32 is half the size.
I would expect X,y both float32 to output a float32. However, I'm not sure what I expect for hybrid 32/64 inputs, maybe the type of X?
import numpy as np
from sklearn.pls import PLSRegression

X = np.asarray(np.random.randn(100,200), dtype='float32')
X.dtype  #dtype('float32')

X2 = np.asarray(np.random.randn(100,200), dtype='float32')
y = np.arange(100, dtype='float32')

transformer = PLSRegression()
transformer.fit(X,y)
out = transformer.transform(X2)
out.dtype  #dtype('float64'), should remain float32
