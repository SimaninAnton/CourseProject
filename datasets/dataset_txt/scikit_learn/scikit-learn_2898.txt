Description
This is a very mino typro. Under section 3.2.2 in the User Guide, the param_distributions example is shown as a list:
[{'C': scipy.stats.expon(scale=100), 'gamma': scipy.stats.expon(scale=.1),'kernel': ['rbf'], 'class_weight':['auto', None]}]
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#randomized-parameter-search
but for RandomizedSearchCV, param_distributions can only be a dict (unlike for GridSearchCV). Might be confusing to someone reading the guide before reading the page describing the class.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
me, cutting and pasting directly from this page, then running RandomizedSearchCV--gives me a "list does not have .values()" error
I'll fix this minor typo myself and submit the pull request. I just want someone to confirm I'm correct and there's not something else I'm failing to understand.
