In https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC , at the end of para 1, I noticed this line:
"with more than a couple of 10000 samples."
This seems confusing to me from a new user's perspective. Does that mean 20000 samples? IF so, why not say that? Could this be clarified
