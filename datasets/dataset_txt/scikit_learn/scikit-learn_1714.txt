It seems that GridSearchCV collects the scores of its (inner) cross-validation folds and then averages across the scores of all folds. I was wondering about the rationale behind this. At first glance, it would seem more flexible to instead collect the predictions of its cross-validation folds and then apply the chosen scoring metric to the predictions of all folds.
The reason I stumbled upon this is that I use GridSearchCV on an imbalanced data set with cv=LeaveOneOut() and scoring='balanced_accuracy' (scikit-learn v0.20.dev0). It doesn't make sense to apply a scoring metric such as balanced accuracy (or recall) to each left-out sample. Rather, I would want to collect all predictions first and then apply my scoring metric once to all predictions. Or does this involve an error in reasoning?
