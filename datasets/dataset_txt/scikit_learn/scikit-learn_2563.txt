Multilabel Y is currently represented as a 2d np.ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix of binary indicators. We explicitly forbid a list of lists or list of arrays, even if it represents the same binary indicators, in sklearn.utils.multiclass.type_of_target etc. This prohibition is for legacy reasons (lists of lists used to indicate multilabel data with different semantics) and we should be able to safely support non-array array-likes as multilabel representations.
Everywhere that multilabel is supported (metrics, estimators), this format should be too.
Derived from #5959.
