On the documentation page of RandomForestClassifier, the description of max_leaf_nodes is :-
max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
Grow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
When using a value like 0 or 1 in it, it produces the following error:
ValueError : max_leaf_nodes 0 must be either smaller than 0 or larger than 1
So the current wording generates a confusion.
Also looking at the source code, we get that negative values are ignored altogether.
Line 173 in tree.py:
           max_leaf_nodes = (-1 if self.max_leaf_nodes is None
                             else self.max_leaf_nodes)
And Line 345:
        # Use BestFirst if max_leaf_nodes given; use DepthFirst otherwise
        if max_leaf_nodes < 0:
             ...
I know that it makes no sense to use 0 or 1 or negative values for this parameter, but still feel that the documentation should be clear on this.
So please change it to something more explicit, like:
max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None) Must be at least 2
