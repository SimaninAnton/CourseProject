Is there a reason why FunctionTransformer only accepts 2 dimensional X? Many sklearn functions accept n dimensional arrays, as long as the first one corresponds to the samples and the other correspond to features.
i.e.
from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer
trans = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: np.mean(x, axis=1))
trans.fit_transform(np.random.rand(100, 10))  # ok

trans = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: np.mean(x, axis=1))
trans.fit_transform(np.random.rand(100, 10, 3))  # not ok
This may relate to #7666
