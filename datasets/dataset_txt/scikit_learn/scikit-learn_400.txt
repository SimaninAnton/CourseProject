Is it possible to alter the Logistic Regression model code to enable the 'learning' of the lambda parameter? (named alpha in sklearn implementations).
In the ElasticNet implementation, the attribute alpha_ returns such paramter.
In the R implementation of GLMnet, the logistic regression model also learns a specified alpha. https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html#log
Currently the implementation requires a 'C' value for penalization. However allowing the model to learn lambda/alpha will prove more beneficial, especially when evaluating the result of the model. Lambda enables us to understand whether the model is meaningful (predicting/learning signal, lower lambda value), or whether the model is predicting the null hypothesis.
