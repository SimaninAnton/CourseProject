In the file class_weight.py, in the function compute_class_weight, is the piece of code:
for c in class_weight:
            i = np.searchsorted(classes, c)
            if i >= len(classes) or classes[i] != c:
                raise ValueError("Class label %d not present." % c)
            else:
                weight[i] = class_weight[c]
The line "Class label %d not present." % c fails if the class label is a string, not an integer.
