Currently plotting a decision tree is a pretty big pain, in particular given how easy it could be in a notebook. jupyter actually has built-in support for showing graphviz graphs.
I suggest we add a function with a lazy graphviz import to return a graphviz graph, instead of writing to a file (it's one call to graphviz.Source()).
Alternatively we could add an option to export_graphviz to return the graph as a string instead of writing to a file. Having to create a StringIO object to show a graph seems silly.
