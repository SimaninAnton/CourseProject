I've been searching Google for hour and not sure anyone knows what these actual variables represent or where the data came from. It's hard to use this dataset for any sort of meaningful purpose without knowing this stuff. Even the sklearn examples don't have axis labels for plots or examples with this data: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#example-linear-model-plot-ols-py
Likewise, no luck directly viewing the source or examining the dataset Bunch object:
from sklearn import datasets

# Not much else here other than the raw data
print dir(datasets.load_diabetes())
The only actual tidbit of information I found on this data set were on this obscure site: http://www.tp.umu.se/~nylen/pylect/advanced/scikit-learn/index.html#linear-model-from-regression-to-sparsity:
The diabetes dataset consists of 10 physiological variables (age, sex, weight, blood pressure) measure on 442 patients, and an indication of disease progression after one year:
Was hoping someone could shed light on this and if so I'd be happy to submit a pull request to improve the documentation.
