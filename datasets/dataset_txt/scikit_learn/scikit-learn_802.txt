The pliable lasso is a truly awesome generalization of the lasso. (Preprint is here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00484.pdf)
I am trying to get an alpha version working here https://github.com/arose13/PliableLasso but the greatest problem I'm having this that the original code is written in Fortran and the most important parts are opaque to me. Moreover, I am having little success getting optimizers to solve this problem (for example, the one suggested by the paper nor naive coordinate descent nor convex optimization).
I thought it would be nice if I made this suggestion when I had some good beta version of the code but I haven't gotten that far ðŸ˜¢
PS: Update -> Convex optimization works but (obviously) scales poorly.
