We should implement a stopping condition based on the scaled norm of the parameter update as done in the new SAG solver for LogisticRegression / Ridge. The convergence check should be done at the end of the each epoch to avoid introducing too much overhead.
Other classes sharing the same underlying implementation should be updated as well, e.g.:
SGDRegressor
PassiveAggressiveClassifier
Perceptron
maybe others.
We should store the effective number of iterations in a new n_iter_ attribute on the estimator at the end of fit as done in many other scikit-learn model that accept a max_iter hyperparam.
