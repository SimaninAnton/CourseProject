KNeighborsClassifier and KNeighborsRegressor (and any others?) handle unspecified **kwargs in their initialization: this means they will not work correctly with clone() in, e.g. cross validation. The API needs to be changed so that kwargs are passed explicitly as a dictionary.
The good news is that these keyword arguments are used only for obscure metrics, so there is likely very little code out in the wild that uses the current problematic API.
