When sticking heads together with some other python folks, @ogrisel and me recently found out that there is easy work-arounds so as to not check in the generated C code.
The idea is that the distributed source package has the generated code, but the repository doesn't.
When a dev wants to build, he needs cython (which I think is reasonable) and it will call cythonize.
when doing cdist however, the C code is generated and will be shipped.
Here is an example from @shoyer:
https://github.com/shoyer/cyordereddict/blob/master/setup.py#L44
Basically if you're doing a release, add the C files, otherwise cythonize the pyx files.
