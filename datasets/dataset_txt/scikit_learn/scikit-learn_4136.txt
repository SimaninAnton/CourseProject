Pipelines like this one:
pl = Pipeline([('encoding', preprocessing.LabelEncoder())])
raise a TypeError when used with the fit method, etc. This is because Pipeline.fit has the following signature fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params) and then calls the LabelEncoder's fit like this: fit(Xt, y, **fit_params), but for the LabelEncoder class, fit is defined as fit(y).
A possible solution is that the code for Pipeline should not forward the y parameter if it is None.
