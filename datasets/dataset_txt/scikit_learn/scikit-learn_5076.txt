The checks in Base_Estimator._get_param_names() mean that subclasses of mixture.GMM that override __init__() must repeat the defaults for all of its keyword arguments, violating DRY. For example, running:
from sklearn import mixture

class My_GMM(mixture.GMM):

   def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
      mixture.GMM.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

print My_GMM()
gives the following exception:
RuntimeError: scikit learn estimators should always specify their parameters in the signature of their init (no varargs).
In other words, this seems to me like a problematic overloading of the constructor signature, and it makes it difficult to subclass mixture.GMM.
Thanks for your hard work on scikit-learn!
