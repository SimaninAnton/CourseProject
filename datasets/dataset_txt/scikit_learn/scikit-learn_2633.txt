Hi,
I ran the sample code here
SVM: Weighted samples
for unbalanced problems. I tried using SVC with linear kernels and LinearSVC, but they produced different results - results in SVC differs but in LinearSVC they are the same. I encountered the same problem in my work - the result doesn't change however I change the class weights :( So I guess there's a bug here or something?
Another thing not quite suited for here - but is there any way to use SVC without an intercept? That after all why I use LinearSVC...
version: sklearn 0.18
Thank you!
