I'm trying to pass a self defined optimizer for GaussianProcessRegressor class, however I'm a little bit confused by the following description in code:
      def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
            # * 'obj_func' is the objective function to be maximized, which
            #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
            #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
            #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
            # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
            #   used by local optimizers
            # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
            ....
            # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
            # the corresponding value of the target function.
            return theta_opt, func_min
There're some contradictary descritions about the optimizer: maximized, func_min
This is a maximize or minimize problem?
