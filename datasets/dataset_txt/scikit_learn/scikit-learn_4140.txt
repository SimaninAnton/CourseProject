The dev documentation is currently littered with <code> blocks that used to be <tt> blocks (see here for example). This is due to a change upstream in sphinx.
IMO, this should not happen: doc building should use a fixed version of sphinx (I assume the necessary change is to be made here?) until we determine that it's safe to upgrade.
