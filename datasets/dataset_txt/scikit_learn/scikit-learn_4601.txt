The following code:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_df = 0.5)
vectorizations[colname] = vectorizer.fit_transform(my_array)
where my_array is a (200000,) array holding strings, with the following counts:
from collections import Counter
Counter(list(my_array))
Counter({'foo': 63696, 'bar': 38806, 'baz': 36492, 'foos`: 19129, 'something': 15675, 'test': 11700, 'more: 861})
throws an exception:
      8 def _amax(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=False):
      9     return um.maximum.reduce(a, axis=axis,
---> 10                             out=out, keepdims=keepdims)
     11 
     12 def _amin(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=False):

ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
However, it works well if I don't specify min_df
