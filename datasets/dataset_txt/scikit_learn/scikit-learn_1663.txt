Sometimes the fitting procedure lasts a long time when using many voters. Therefore it would be nice to get some feedback.
I think it could be done by just passing the "verbose" keyword to the Parallel() call in line 186 of the current stable voting_classifier.py and adding it to VotingClassifier.__init__.
