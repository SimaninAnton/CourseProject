Seems that Andy and I agree that we don't need a display object for plot_tree, opinions from other core devs are welcomed.
We'll need to return a Display object in plot_partial_dependence, I don't think this breaks current API (because currently we return nothing).
ping @thomasjpfan do you want to finish this?
