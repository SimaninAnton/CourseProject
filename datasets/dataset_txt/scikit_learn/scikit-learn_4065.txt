Lasso and Elastic Net
Lasso and elastic net (L1 and L2 penalisation) implemented using a
coordinate descent.
The coefficients can be forced to be positive.
Computing regularization path using the lasso...
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/linear_model/coordinate_descent.py:229: DeprecationWarning: Use enet_path(return_models=False), as it returns the coefficients and alphas instead of just a list of models as previously lasso_path/enet_path did. return_models will eventually be removed in 0.15, after which, returning alphas and coefs will become the norm.
