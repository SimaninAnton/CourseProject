The consistency brigade just noticed that the number of repetitions / folds in cross_validation
as the following names:
StratifiedKFold and KFold : k
StratifiedShuffleSplit, ShuffleSplit: n_iterations
Bootstrap: n_bootstraps
I think n_folds would be a good name. Not sure if fold is reserved for KFold and doesn't apply to ShuffleSplit.
Suggestions?
Wdyt?
Edit: we generally moved away from one letter parameters and KMeans has a n_clusters parameter, not k.
