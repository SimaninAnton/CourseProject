RobustScaler raises a TypeError when calling fit with a sparse matrix as input, despite the docs indicating that using a sparse matrix is feasible as long as with_centering=False. Looks like the fit method is blocking any sparse matrix input with an if statement:

I can provide some code to reproduce if necessary, but I want to make sure this makes sense first. Thanks!
