I think we might want to change the default strategy of DummyClassifier to 'prior'. I have never used it with anything but most_frequent, but prior behaves like most_frequent for predict and makes somewhat more sense for predict_proba.
This beautiful tweet illustrates probably the most common use-case of DummyClassifier:

We could probably use the code analysis tools mentioned in other places to see if people ever user the current default DummyClassifier(strategy='stratified'), it seems not very useful in practice when evaluating metrics.
