Hi, I use PCA from sklearn.decomposition, I want to reduce the components to 400, but unfortunately, I got 100 components. The following is the code and console when running.
code:
import read_data
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np
batch_xs, batch_ys = read_data.batch(100)
print "batch_xs.shape:",batch_xs.shape   
pca = PCA(n_components=400)
pca.fit(batch_xs)
tttt = pca.transform(batch_xs)
print "tttt.shape",tttt.shape
console print:
load dataset....
batch_xs.shape: (100, 26715)
tttt.shape (100, 100)
It would be really helpful if anyone can solve this question.Thanks.
