Description
Some algorithms don't pass tests in 32-bit mode. They should be investigated.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
To test this, you just need to run (in some temp directory where it is okay to clone a temp repo to):
git clone https://www.github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
cd scikit-learn
# run docker container in interactive mode:
docker run --rm  -it -v`pwd`:/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_i686 /bin/bash
export PATH=/opt/python/cp36-cp36m/bin:$PATH
pip install numpy scipy cython pytest; cd /io;python setup.py develop;sed -i '/--doctest-modules/d' setup.cfg;pytest -l sklearn
The building will take a while....
Expected Results
Tests should all pass
Actual Results
Three fail.
