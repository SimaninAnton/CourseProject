1 someone en Bulldog
1 someone en Bulldog
1 someone en Bulldog
1 someone es QQQQ
1 someone es QQQQ
1 someone es QQQQ
1 someone es QQQQ
so I train
print("Bernoulli - Naive Bayes")
classifier = BernoulliNB().fit(x_train,y_train)
y_predicted = classifier.predict(x_test)
then I test for bulldog and dog
Please enter sentence to test language identification. \q to quit: Bulldog
You entered: Bulldog
Bulldog is English
Please enter sentence to test language identification. \q to quit: dog
You entered: dog
dog is NOT English
SO DOG IS NOT DETECTED CORRECTLY
In short problem is: I use Bernoulli - Naive Bayes for language identification and gives for train 2 words
Bulldog and QQQQ, then I give short word dog and expect to classify it is English,
since it is the part of English word from training, which consists this trigram dog
but this word is not detected correctly
Actually there is another big problem but this toy example show something wrong generally?
