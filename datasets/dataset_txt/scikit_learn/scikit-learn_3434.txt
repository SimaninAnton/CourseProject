hi,
when i run the code on the webpage: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_feature_transformation.html, the compiler gets the error as the title mentioned. i turn to the webpage which describes main info of GradientBoostingClassifier, and i find actually there is the "APPLY" function!!
why!??
by the way, my sklearn is version of 64bit, and 0.16.1
