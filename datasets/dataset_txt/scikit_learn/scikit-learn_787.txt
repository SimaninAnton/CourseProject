Description
Allow classifiers to learn one class.
Background: when using scikit-learn on real data (gathered with a sliding window, or when start using the system), there are cases where there are samples of only one class. In order to keep the infrastructure simple, it would be awesome when scikit-learn would not throw an error and produce the class when asked for a prediction.

Steps/Code to Reproduce
texts = ['abc', 'edf', 'ghi', 'jkl']
targets = ['1234', '1234', '1234', '1234']
clf = Pipeline([
      ('vect', TfidfVectorizer()),
      ('clf', LinearSVC()),
])
clf.fit(texts, targets)
# store clf
....
# load clf
clf.predict([qwe])
Expected Results
can load clf
get prediction return the only known class
Actual Results
ValueError: This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: u'1234'
