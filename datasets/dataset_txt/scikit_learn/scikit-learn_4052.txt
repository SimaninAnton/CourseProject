Hello,
I noticed a overflow warning when training a GradientBoostingClassifier, when using sklearn 0.15.2. This warning is also present in the dev version. I have created a patch (simply use utils.fixes.expit) and will do a pull request shorly.
The patched version suppress the warning. To test the patch, I ran the two version of the code against my data and obtain the same results.
