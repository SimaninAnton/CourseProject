The error messages for TSNE says that the user can specify the initialization with a numpy array; however, the documentation and the input checking seem to insist otherwise. The TSNE code is even able to handle numpy array initialization.
The ability to initialize with a pre-existing numpy array would be useful to me, so I would be in favor of modifying the type checking to allow the numpy arrays through.
I'd be happy to submit a bug-fix, but I thought I'd check on the desired functionality first.
>>> from sklearn import manifold
>>> tsne = manifold.TSNE(init=np.zeros((100, 2)))

ValueError: 'init' must be 'pca', 'random' or a NumPy array
