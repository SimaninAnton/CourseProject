The metrics.roc_auc_score and metrics.average_precision_score docstrings currently have "True binary labels in binary label indicators" as the description for their y_true parameter. I think that it should say "or binary label indicators". Also, it might be beneficial to be slightly more explicit about the accepted true binary labels (e.g. the y_true parameter in metrics.roc_curve is described as "True binary labels in range {0, 1} or {-1, 1}").
I suggest something along the lines of "True binary labels (either {0, 1} or {-1, 1}) or binary label indicators" as an update for the metrics.roc_auc_score and metrics.average_precision_scoredocstrings. If this seems like a reasonable change, I can submit a PR with the update. Thanks!
