@larsmans suggested this a while ago but no one has tackled it yet.
For example classifiers should check whether there is at least one class present (see also issue #886)
This is also related to issue #864.
All estimator should check whether the input dimensions for predict or transform are the same as in fit.
Also see this discussion: [https://github.com//issues/253#issuecomment-1615044]
I see three possible ways to do this:
Implement _check_input_fit and _check_input_predict in the EstimatorMixins and call them in each estimator
Pretty but ugly: use decorators that perform the checks
prettyier but uglier: define the checks in the mixins, inject the code for the checks using some crazy introspection (would keep the estimator implementations clean).
The third one could be implemented for example by creating __new__ functions in the mixins and changing the fit and predict functions of the created instance so as to do the checks....
I'm not sure how much I'd like that, though....
