The error message reported in this SO issue is confusing:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35570160/valueerror-y-contains-non-binary-labels-for-votingclassifier-with-my-gradientbo
In the event y only comprise a single class label (once samples with zero weights are trimmed) we should yield a more informative error message that says so explicitly.
