I encountered the problem as I am trying to do this
It seems like the log-likelihood component is slightly different so I re-derived the cost function of logistic regression and got something different from the one sklearn uses:
This is the same as the one in the glmnet package in R, but different from sklearn with difference lies in the $\exp(-y_i)$ in the last term while sklearn seems to have 1 in place. Wonder if I am missing something here or if sklearn is using a different cost function for minimization.
