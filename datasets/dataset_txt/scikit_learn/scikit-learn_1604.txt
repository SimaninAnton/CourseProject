Similarly to #9673, as of numpy 1.14,
the following snippet,
import numpy as np
X = np.array(['abc'])
np.issubdtype(X.dtype, str)
will raise a,
FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `str` to `str` is deprecated.
In future, it will be treated as `np.str_ == np.dtype(str).type`.
This affects CategoricalEncoder (used twice in the implementation and twice in the corresponding tests).
See numpy 1.14 release notes for more details.
