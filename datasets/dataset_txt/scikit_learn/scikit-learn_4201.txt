In decomposition reference documentation it is stated that the complexity for the regular PCA is
O(n_{max}^2 n_{min}) for the exact method implemented in PCA.
which becomes for a typical setting where there is more sample than feature,
O(nsamples^2 nfeatures)
Considering PCA only requires to work on the covariance matrix (nfeatures x nfeatures) which construction cost is
O(nsamples nfeatures^2)
isn't the squared nmax an error?
