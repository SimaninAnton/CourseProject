r2_score returns r correlation coefficient not r2 coefficient of determination.
Your documentation indicates in
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html
that r2_score can return negative results with examples. This means you are actually producing the r , or correlation coefficient, indicating negative and positive correlation.
an R2 is between 0-1 and is never negative.
