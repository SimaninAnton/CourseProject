#7481 raises the issue that checking the presence of some attributes can be expensive and #7487 fixed this for feature_importances_. We should identify what other attributes (particularly underscore-suffixed) are currently being checked with hasattr in the codebase and identify any that are risky by way of being defined as properties that are or may be expensive to compute.
grep hackers welcome.
