Description
Currently when doing cross-validation and verbose set, it prints the time for each fold. However, the time printed is just the score time, not score + fit as one would expect: see here. After changing logger.short_format_time(score_time) to logger.short_format_time(fit_time + score_time) it prints the total time correctly, as expected.
Note that in previous version it printed total time correctly, even through the variable still was called scoring_time.
