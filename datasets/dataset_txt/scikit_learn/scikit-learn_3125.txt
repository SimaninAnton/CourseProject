I am experiencing a big difference in the output of the AdaBoostClassifier (probability of the event to belong to the signal) between the scikit-learn version 0.16 and 0.17 (see attachments). The background distributions look very different - although the signal efficiency and the purity are very similar when cutting at certain positions. The same code is used to create both plots - only the version of scikit-learn are different. Python 3 was used in both cased.
