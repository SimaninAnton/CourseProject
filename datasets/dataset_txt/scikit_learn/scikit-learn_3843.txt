Hi,
I am using RandomForestClassifier and it seems to crash when the data set gets too large. See below, it works with 100 trees, however fails using the exact same code for 300 trees.
below my Python version, I am on an X220 Lenovo Win7 machine. 64 bit, 4GB memory, i5-2540M
any advice appreciated.
Thank you,
Darragh.

rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
rfc.fit(X, y)
rfc_calib = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_estimator=rfc, cv=5)
print log_loss(y_test, rfc.predict_proba(X_test))
