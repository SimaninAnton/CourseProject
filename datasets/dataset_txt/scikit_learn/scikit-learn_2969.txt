I am trying to cluster using MiniBatchKMeans and I am getting around 20 deprecation warnings every time. It's a bit annoying in a jupyter notebook as it fills the screen. Can you confirm this is happening for you as well?
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

data = np.random.rand(100,3)
mb = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=5)
mb.fit_predict(data)
