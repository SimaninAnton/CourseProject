To me the DictVectorizer.restrict docsting is unclear and I didn't understand it when reading it.
It is missing a return statement. Also, the function modifies the estimator in-place, which is a rather rare thing in scikit-learn (only other example I can think of is sparsify), so that should be made more explicit.
Maybe also give an example?
