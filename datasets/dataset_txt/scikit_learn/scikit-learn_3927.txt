For linear models with regularization, the input variables should be standardized because the solution is not scale invariant. I noticed that in the ridge regression source code, the input variables are centered by mean subtraction but normalization by std deviation is a flag.
My questions are:
Under what circumstances should normalized be set to True so that both centering and normalizing by std. dev are turned on?
Does normalize=True affect prediction? When predicting from new X, should X be centered and normalized?
Does normalizing have any affect on the range of alpha the regularization parameter? It would be nice to be able to restrict alpha to [0, 1].
It would be great if the documentation made this clear. Thanks.
