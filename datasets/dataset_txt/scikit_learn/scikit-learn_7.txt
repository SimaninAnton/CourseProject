Current functionality only allows splitting the input data into 2 parts i.e. "Train" and "Test" datasets.
Extension to this functionality is to allow 3 splits of dataset i.e. Train, Test and Validation using the function call only once.
High level impact assessment changes to :-
train_test_split()
Other modules may also be impacted - Assessment ongoing
