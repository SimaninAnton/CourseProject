Description
Passing a pre-computed distance matrix to the dbscan algorithm does not seem to work properly.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import sklearn
import numpy as np
data = np.load('./clusterable_data.npy')
AA = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances(data, data)
db = DBSCAN(metric="precomputed").fit(AA)
print db.labels_
The "clusterable_data.npy" can be found from this address. Note that I am using the dbscan's own function to produce the distance matrix.
Expected Results
The db.labels_ contains the cluster labels that have to be positive integers. For this particular example the algorithm should find at least 5 clusters.
Actual Results
The returned labels are all zero meaning that it is clustering all the data points into one cluster.
[0 0 0 ..., 0 0 0]
I don't know if I am making a mistake in passing the distance matrix or there is a bug in the code. I appreciate your attention.
