I tried to use Perceptron for multiclass classification and random forests with n_job=-1 but it does not produce additional processes, even it prolongs the execution time more. I believe something related with OpenMP is conflicting in sklearn but maybe I am wrong. Any idea about the problem ?
Edit: I am running the code on Ipython Notebook with Python2.7 support
This is the code that I call in a Notebook cell
