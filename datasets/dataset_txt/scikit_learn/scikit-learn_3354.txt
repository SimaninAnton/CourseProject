The intrinsic dimensionality of a dataset is usually not known a priori. Because of this, intrinsic dimensionality estimation techniques have been developed so that one can choose how many components to keep after running a dimensionality reduction technique non-arbitrarily. Scikit-learn has already implemented one such technique, MLE, and has allowed the PCA module to accept "mle" for the n_components parameter. I think the dimensionality reduction techniques in sklearn.manifold should also have this capability.
