Todays topic: Why is KMeans in sklearn to slow?
Answer: Fancy indexing in _centers.
According to my new friend runsnakerun and my old friend kernprof, about 60% of the time of KMeans is spent doing fancy indexing to find out which data point belongs to which cluster.
While the ~60% is derived just from MNIST and digits with 10 clusters and probably doesn't hold in general, I think there should be quite some speedup that can be achieved here.
