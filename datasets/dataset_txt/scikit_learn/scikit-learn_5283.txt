Long Estimator names look bad in the references, see for example here. They reach over the boundary in the header and in the sidebar.
Not sure what to do with the sidebar, maybe line breaks in between modules? For the title, we could just make the font smaller.
Maybe our web-guru @jaquesgrobler wants to have a look.
