Bugs is at the initialization of splitter
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py#L1007
Note that currently this is working partially, because the condition is also verified in the tree growing procedure. Otherwise said, we might accept a split that violate the pre-pruning condition, but won't grow further a node that violates the condition.
