Hello everyone! I was trying to add some new multiview features to the library, but the autodoc seems not to be working. I created a folder inside sklearn and put code files in it, with the docstring in Numpy format. Afterwards, I created a multiview.rst file inside /doc/modules directory and changed setup.py file in the root directory to include the new functionality.
I achieved to generate multiview.html file and the examples files included in the examples directory. However, the autodoc files for the classes in the code I wrote are not generated, and, consequently, the html was not generated. The fork I made from the library is available at https://github.com/mariceli3/scikit-learn.
I try to have the multiview.MVMDS, multiview.MVSC rst files autogenerated. Nevertheless I cannot get that. Might anyone know what I am doing wrong?
Thank you in advance!
