Two major things here -
Often I see that only a partial output of _fit_and_score is taken for use. It is wasteful to generate and discard arrays. It would rather be much better to generate only the stuff that is required.
Now that we have more options, like @jnothman says here and here should we modify the output of cross_val_score (and also _fit_and_score to be a dict or a named tuple similar to the structure of cv_results_? (I think named-tuple is a better choice atleast for _fit_and_score as we stack the result of multiple _fit_and_score operations via Parallel mostly)
If we are changing the output of cross_val_score, this would be an ideal time to do it as we don't have to deprecate anything...
