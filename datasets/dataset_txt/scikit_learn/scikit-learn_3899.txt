Today there were two questions on stack overflow where the answer was more or less to add feature_importance_ to Pipeline or GridSearchCV. I wonder if that would be a good idea.
Actually, I think for GridSearchCV it is not very useful, but for Pipeline it might be.
With Pipeline there is an additional complication, which is that the number of features that goes in might not correspond to the number of features that the last estimator is trained on. I'm not sure how to handle that. Maybe with inverse_transform? That would require adding an inverse_transform to OneHotEncoder. That might actually be feasible.
