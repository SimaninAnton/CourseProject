Is there any way to re-train an already trained regressor like RandomForestRegresor with new data. Lets assume we have already trained a regressor for some data. We have new data and we want to augment the existing regressor with the new data, without retraining with whole data from scratch? Can this be done? In Keras for neural networks, for example, this can be done, since the weights can be loaded.
Thanx,
