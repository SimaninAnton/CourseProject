Was trying to do some cross validation between KMeans, BIRCH and DBSCAN, however the methods used by cross_validation.cross_val_predict amd cross_validation.cross_val_score are not consistent between these estimators.
Maybe the cross_val_predict should check for predict first and then fall back to predict first. I understand the need for the difference.
Also why is there a score for only KMeans? Can be implemented across the border?
