 pi = expit(f) 
This code calculates $$p_i=p(y_i=1|f_i)$$ as pi = expit(f) where expit is the logistic regression function while in Rasmussen & Williams Algorithm 3.1 $$p_i$$ is defined as $$expit(f*y)$$. The labels are incorporated in this prediction, according to the text. Is this an intentional difference in the scipy codebase?
