Description
The documentation for sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix links to the Wikipedia article for confusion matrix.
On Wikipedia the example uses columns for y_true and rows for y_pred.
In confusion_matrix() , rows are used for y_true and columns for y_pred.
This can be rather confusing and misleading. Although it can be inferred from the C(0,0) in the description I suggest to make this clearer in the example.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
import sklearn
y_true = [0,1,1,2]
y_pred = [0,0,1,1]

confmat = sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
# result shows rows as y_true counts, while wikipedia does the opposite.
