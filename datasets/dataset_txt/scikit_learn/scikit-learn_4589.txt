Hi,
MiniBatchKmeans crashes when compute_labels=True in "_assign _labels _array()" in cluster/_k_means.c with a Segmentation Fault.
This is probably simply because it runs out of memory (I am working with very large amounts of data), but there should be better error checking instead of a core dump. I just had a look at the code but I am not familiar enough with it to find out where it goes wrong.
If you need more information, please provide advice on how best to obtain traces.
