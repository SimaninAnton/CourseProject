Description
I have found DecisionTreeClassifier was classified incorrectly in sklearn: 0.21.dev0 just now. If only input data has two classification, the DecisionTreeClassifier must predict 0 label. How is this going? I haven't done any change in source code. Even if I test the official use case of sklearn, this is the case.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
python
from sklearn import tree
X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
Y = [0, 1]
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf = clf.fit(X, Y)
clf.predict([[2., 2.]])
Expected Results
It should be 1
Output: array([1])
Actual Results
Output: array([0])
