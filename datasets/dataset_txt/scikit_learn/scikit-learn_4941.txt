I've been trying to get a nice way of getting @amueller 's
into the documentation..
Outside of how I'm trying to do it, I also need feedback on where exactly this would go in the docs.
Implementing it is another thing.. basically, I want it to not just be a static image, but an html image map that will link to the docs. For example, if the user clicks on the SGD Regressor box, he must be sent to the relevant documentation in the guide.
I've gotten this right using the VUE software.. but it has some limitations.
Below I made a quick rough version of a piece of it. It's not pretty yet and the colors and general look of it I just quickly did.. so yes it's ugly hehe..
This actual works fine .. It sends me to SGD Regressor when I click on it as desired.
The problem is that VUE adds that ugly little html button to a node when you add a hyperlink to it - which I seem to be unable to remove. So using VUE, I can do what I want, but unless I can remove thos ugly little side html thingies, it'll be ugly. One other option is to have just a thumbnail or smaller image of Andy's plot in the docs, then have it link to the full ugly one - which will have the links and all.
VUE asside, I've been trying to find another piece of software that I can do this with, but without much success. Inkscape, which is what Andy's map is made in I think, is great but doesn't allow html map exporting. I also tried the InkscapeMap add-on program to convert SVG files into html maps but without any success.
So I really could use some clever feedback here - unless you guys are fine with the thumbnail idea I mentioned earlier. I really need some way of being able to edit/recreate the map, add the links to the docs to it, and make an html image map thereof.
Lastly, it would be best if it was a simple way, else maintaining this in the long run could become a pest.
Looking forward to any feedback
