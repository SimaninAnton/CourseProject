Description
I noticed that @NicolasHug is in the process of adding Yeo-Johnson to scipy here scipy/scipy#9305.
Once it gets merged, I think PowerTransformer could be updated to use the new scipy.stats.yeojohnson function as the estimator; we're doing this for Box-Cox atm, and this keeps the actual parameter estimation code out of the transformer. Doesn't look like scipy is a pinned dependency so this can happen soon as Yeo-Johnson makes it into a release.
