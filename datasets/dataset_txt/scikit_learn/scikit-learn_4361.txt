I suggest adding partial AUC to the metrics. this would compute the area under the curve up to a specified FPR (in the case of the ROC curve). this measure is important for comparing classifiers in cases where FPR is much more important than TPR. The partial AUC should also allow applying the McClish correction. see here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pROC/pROC.pdf
