says
C_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (n_classes - 1,)

    Array of C that maps to the best scores across every class. If refit is set to False, then for each class, the best C is the average of the Câ€™s that correspond to the best scores for each fold.
but it doesn't say when it would be either shape. I think it should.
