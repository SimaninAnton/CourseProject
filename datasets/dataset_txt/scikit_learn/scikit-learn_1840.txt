It seems that for clustering estimators, fit_predict(X) (or labels_) always returns integers in the range [0, ..., n_clusters - 1] except for DBSCAN where there is also a label -1 for outliers. Do we want to enforce this behavior and add a common test?
EDIT: Should we at least ensure that clustering estimators predict integers?
What about outlier detection estimators where the predicted labels are always in {-1, 1}?
This is related to PR #9270.
