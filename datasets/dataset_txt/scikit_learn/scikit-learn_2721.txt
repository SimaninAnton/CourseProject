This has been logged as an issue many times over the last two years. It looks as if the issues are all closed but the latest release 0.18 does not include it.

There is even some documentation here:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict.html#sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict
I tried using the source from that version but it is not compatible with 0.18. I am currently using an older source that works with 0.17. However I anticipated it would be included in 0.18 and now it is not I wonder whether it has been abandoned? I don't want to be stuck with out of date version! Please advise if this is planned.
