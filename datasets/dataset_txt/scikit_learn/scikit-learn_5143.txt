I know, this isn't a code issue really but hopefully my issue fits here somehow anyway. I'd like to know whether there is a more or less simple way of adding the expectation maximization algorithm to the supervised Naive Bayes classifiers MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB in sklearn.naive_bayes.
I've found a pull request with an implementation of this in a semi-supervised approach but it seems that it hasn't been merged so far to master. But I need it for a completely supervised setting.
Has anyone done something like that or can anyone tell me how to start implementing EM? I'm a bit lost in where to start.
Thank you!
