Description
I am trying to using sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture to fit a set of trajectories of data points. Each trajectory consists of a set of data points, e.g. t_i = {x_i1, y_i1, x_i2, y_i2, ... , x_iN, y_iN}, where t_i is the ith trajectory and (x_ik, y_ik) is the kth point on the trajectory.
Each GP component will be a mapping from x_ik -> y_ik. That's quite standard for learning a GP using sklearn.
However, when you want to learn a Gaussian Mixture model with Dirichlet Process prior, you have to decide when a new GP component will be added. The BayesianGaussianMixture class only provides you an interface to do cluster assignment based on a single data point. In other words, whether a new data point belongs to a new cluster or not.
What I am interested in is that: Give a set of trajectories, where each trajectory might contain a lot of data points. Is there a way to do cluster assignment based on the trajectory? i.e. Given a new trajectory, decide whether it belongs to a new cluster or not.
Thanks a lot for your help ;)
