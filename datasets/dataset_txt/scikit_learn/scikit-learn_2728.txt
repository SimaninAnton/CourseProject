Description
I noticed problems with the search results on the scikit-learn website. I am not sure if this problem just occurred today after 0.18 went live. Below is a screenshot of how it looks like when I do a search on the main page; on subpages the search does not seem to work altogether -- tested it on Chrome and Safari.
