I'm peculiarly getting an error while using AdaBoostClassifier with GaussianNB() or LogisticRegression() as a base estimator.
These are my commands
In [65]: gnb = GaussianNB()
In [66]: bdt = AdaBoostClassifier(gnb,n_estimators=100)
In [67]: bdt.fit(X,y)
I get the following error after executing "In[67]" :
TypeError: fit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sample_weight'
Any reason why I might be getting this?
PS: I frequently use adaboosting with Navie Bayes as a base classifier in WEKA, hence the concern
Thank you very much!
