Reported on SO:
def test_cv():
    from sklearn import cross_validation
    X = np.random.randn(6, 4)
    y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    cv = cross_validation.KFold(len(y), n_folds=3, shuffle=True)
    clf = qda.QDA()
    scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=cv)
can cause QDA to crash. The problems is in the scalings_ attribute, which can take the form
array([array([ nan]),
       array([  4.51776471e+00,   2.98684272e-01,   5.55011150e-32])], dtype=object)
The bug doesn't show up every time, even when I fix the random seed, so it's probably randomness/instability inside np.linalg.svd.
