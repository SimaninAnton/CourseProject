Perhaps I am missing something very obvious, but in the standard kernels associated with scikit-learn's Gaussian process regression framework, the radial basis function (RBF),
f = exp(-x^2/(2l^2))
has its gradient evaluated with respect to its hyperparameter, l. This should be equal to:
df/dl = (x^2/l^3)f
yet in the code, the output appears to be (c.f. line 1233 and neighbouring code):
df/dl = (x^2/l^2)f
I am wondering if I am perhaps missing something in the applied definitions and/or steps involved, or if this is actually an error in the code. Perhaps errors in evaluating certain gradients are possibly causing issues as observed here as I have similarly observed negative variances in some instances.
