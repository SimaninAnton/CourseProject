Pardon me if I am wrong, but in the code example http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/document_clustering.html, on this line
print("Silhouette Coefficient: %0.3f"
% metrics.silhouette_score(X, labels, sample_size=1000))
Here labels is referring to the ground truth of the dataset. Should it should be km.labels_ instead?
