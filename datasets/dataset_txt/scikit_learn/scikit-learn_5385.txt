Laplacian Eigenmaps is one of the few standard manifold / embedding methods that is still missing from sklearn.
It should be pretty easy to implement as it is quite similar to the spectral clustering algorithm (if I understand it correctly).
Todo:
Move the spectra_embedding into the decomposition module
Create an estimator object around it
write documentation
add to the References
