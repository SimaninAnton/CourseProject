Description
doc/README.md was updated in #10225 and now includes sphinx-gallery as a dependency. I.e. it now says "Building the website requires the sphinx, sphinx-gallery and matplotlib packages".
However, doc/developers/contributing.rst says "For building the documentation, you will need sphinx, matplotlib and pillow".
I'd be happy to submit a PR that updates doc/developers/contributing.rst to match doc/README.md. Or even better, removing the reference to dependencies in doc/developers/contributing.rst because it directs users to doc/README.md anyways ("See the README file in the doc/ directory for more information").
