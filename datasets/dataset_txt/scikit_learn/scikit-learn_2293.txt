I'm working on training a classification tree to predict rare events (website conversions) - using proportion=True option in tree.export_graphviz() is nice because it shows me conversion rates for the various nodes in the tree.
Because these are rare events and because I'm building the tree from hundreds of thousands of samples, there is a significant difference between proportions 0.01 and 0.014 or 0.001 and 0.004, however the function is hardcoded to round to 2 decimal places
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/tree/export.py#L263
So when viewing the tree, the proportions above round to the same values.
I'd like to request an additional optional parameter proportionPrecision=2 to this function so users can optionally increase the precision when fractions of a decimal point matter.
