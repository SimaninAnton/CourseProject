I don't think we're good at removing redundant parameter assignment in examples/tests.
e.g., in the examples folder
git grep "cv=5" | wc -l
27
(we no longer need cv=5 because we've finished the deprecation).
I can't come up with an automatic solution for this issue (an awkward solution is to manually go through all the API changes and search the repo).
