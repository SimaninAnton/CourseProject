The callable kernel in the SVM needs to work on arrays of shape (n_samples, n_features). This is not clear from the docs and should be made explicit here:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC
Also the example here uses lowercase letters for the parameters, suggesting vectors: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/svm/plot_custom_kernel.html#example-svm-plot-custom-kernel-py
Same here:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/svm.html#custom-kernels
The docs do mention matrices, but are not explicit about the shapes. Again I think we should use upper case letters for things that are (n_samples, n_features) and mention the shapes explicitly.
