I am trying to learn a Dictionary by using Sci-kit Learn. It is working fine for 100 Images but If I use 200 Images to train Dictionary Then I am getting Segmentation fault error.
I have used GDB to debug my code. and got this error :0x00007ffff3059f50 in ATL_dJIK0x0x48NN0x0x0_aX_bX () from /usr/lib/libblas.so.3
How to fix this problem??
