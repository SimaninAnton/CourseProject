Looking at the docstring of sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix says little on whether x axis or the y axis of the returned confusion matrix is the 'actual' or the 'predicted' labels. There is a link to the wikipedia page on confusion matrices, but the output of the sklearn implementation appears to be the exact transpose of what is shown in the referred wiki page.
