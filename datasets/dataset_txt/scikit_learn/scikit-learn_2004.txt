Using scikit-optimize I realized that it would be great if we could provide nightly wheels. The numpy and scipy wheels mean that we can run CI against their master, which is great for us and them.
It would be good if we could provide the same courtesy to our downsteam users.
(also I just asked cython to do the same for us, so we should set a good example ;)
I have not looked into how scipy and numpy do it, but I'd hope we can steal some of their tools.
