I tried to launch a permutation test with Leave-One-Out cross-validation and all MCC scores obtained equal zero. I wonder if it is possible to adapt the function permutation_test_score() in order to perform a permutation test with Leave-One-Out cross-validation.
In addition, I would recommend to add an argument 'fit_params' to the function.
