The fit_transform method of TfidfVectorizer returns a CSR matrix, which supports array indexing, while CountVectorizer returns a COO matrix, which doesn't. I always liked the clean and interchangeable nature of sklearn, so I wondered, whether it would break other pieces if we would return a CSR matrix in CountVectorizer as well. Or is performance a concern here?
