Pretty sure I've seen this in other classifiers/regressors as well, but most recently saw it with ExtraTrees. It's a simple problem: running in an ipynb (ipython 3.0), if I pass a pandas series (or dataframe column) to the sample_weights parameter, I get a kernel shutdown with no explanation. After trial and error, I realized I needed to pass an array instead (so add ".values" to the series object), and the same exact code works fine that way.
Rather than forcing others to debug the same way, can someone add a check to the weighting code to confirm it's valid input? Then, if it's a series, perhaps either add ".values" automatically, or raise an error rather than try to force it through?
