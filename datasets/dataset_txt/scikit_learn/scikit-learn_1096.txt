Description
In page http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity.html#sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity, the description of KernelDensity.score_samples() is Evaluate the density model on the data, where actually it returns the log(density) and we need to take exp() on it to get raw density back.
I think the doc should be Evaluate the log density model on the data, otherwise users may get confused when they see negative outputs.
