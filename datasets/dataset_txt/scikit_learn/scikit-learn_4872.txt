As Stefano Lattarini mentioned here
When the 'n_init' argument is given, I'd expect both of these classes
to run the corresponding algorithm (Lloyd and mini-batch k-means,
respectively) 'n_init' times on the data to be fitted, each time with
a different initialization, and then select the result which gives the
smallest inertia.
However, while this expectation is met by the KMeans class, it's not
really met the by the MiniBatchKMeans class: the latter only executes
the initialization of centroids 'n_init' times, then selecting the
initialization that gives the smallest inertia, and running the mini-batch
k-means algorithm only once, with that initialization.
The above is intended behavior and needs to be mentioned in the docs, as the MiniBatch is meant to do only a few passes on the data, for efficiency reasons
