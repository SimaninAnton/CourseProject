Lots of issues are reported, and many of them do not include important debugging information (scikit-learn version, numpy version, scipy version, etc.) or proper formatting (e.g. traceback in codeblocks).
Github rolled out a new feature today to create PR and Issue "templates" that would simply serve to help contributors effectively structure their issues / PRs.
I think a PR template would be of limited use, but an issue template simply reminding users to include certain information in their post would be handy. Here's a link to the feature announcement: https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates
