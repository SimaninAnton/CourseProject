Hello,
I am not sure if it is mathematical or implementation problem, but it's definitely annoying and user should be at least warned...
When I try this code:
from sklearn.svm import SVC
clf = SVC(kernel="poly", degree=2)
X = [[1,99999], [2,99999]]
y = [0,1]
clf.fit(X,y)
process then takes forever. I can see that it's taking full CPU, so I guess it does not hang, but I have never got the result even on pretty good PC.
scikit-learn (0.16.0) and Python 3.4.3.
What is interesting, I got results immediately for:
from sklearn.svm import SVC
clf = SVC(kernel="poly", degree=2)
X = [[1,9999], [2,9999]]
y = [0,1]
clf.fit(X,y)
Method is hence relatively unstable. Is this somehow solvable? Or are there some ways by which I can predict if it's solvable by poly kernel, or not? In R it's working OK and I got the results for much larger and much complicated (larger dimensions and larger dissimilarities) datasets by e.g. this code (not a minimal example, just for illustration):
svmfit<-svm(y=yy,x=XX,kernel='polynomial',degree=2,type='C-classification')
Thank you
