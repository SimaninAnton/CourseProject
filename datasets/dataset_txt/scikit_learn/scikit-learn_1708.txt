In the latest version, runing a code like this:
a = np.arange(10).reshape((10,1))
kfold = StratifiedKFold(2)
for i, j in kfold.split(np.zeros((10)), a):
    print(i)
It says n_splits=2 cannot be greater than the number of members in each class.
But it can run like this:
b = np.zeros(10).reshape((10,1))
kfold = StratifiedKFold(2)
for i, j in kfold.split(np.zeros((10)), b):
    print(i)
or like this:
c = np.arange(10).reshape((10,1)) - np.arange(10).reshape((10,1))
kfold = StratifiedKFold(2)
for i, j in kfold.split(np.zeros((10)), c):
    print(i)
I cannot understand the difference among 'a', 'b' and 'c'
where is the problem?
