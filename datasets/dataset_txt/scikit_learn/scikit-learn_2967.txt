Hi, I think the reference to lambda is wrong in online_lda class LatentDirichletAllocation attribute documentation: https://github.com/someuser89/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/online_lda.py#L227
I think it is called phi instead lambda. See http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf there is no lamba but a phi for word distribution topics.
Maybe there is a paper in which a lambda is used, but which one?
Versions
I found this in Version 0.17.1 and in the master branch.
