test_type_of_target is failing on scipy-dev because it uses pd.SparseSeries:
FutureWarning: SparseSeries is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use a Series with sparse values instead.

    >>> series = pd.Series(pd.SparseArray(...))

    See http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/sparse.html#migrating for more.
