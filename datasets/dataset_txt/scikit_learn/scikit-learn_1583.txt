I feel like
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_sgd_penalties.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-sgd-penalties-py
should use
https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/spine_placement_demo.html
instead of drawing the cross.
The rest of the code is also not that great, I wonder whether using plt.contour would make this easier to read.
