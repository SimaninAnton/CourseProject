Once PR #313 is merged, it should be fairly straightforward to add a keyword p to classes in sklearn.neighbors to specify an arbitrary Minkowski metric for nearest neighbors searches.
BallTree accepts p upon construction
cKDTree accepts p upon querying
Brute-force will be able to make use of the updates in PR #313: the new sklearn.pairwise module will have functions manhattan_distance for p=1, euclidean_distance for p=2, and minkowski_distance for arbitrary p. These should have output format similar to what is currently used in sklearn.neighbors with algorithm='brute'. The code should use these two specialized functions for p=1 and p=2, as they are faster than the general routine.
