I was wondering if for the non-legacy mode we want to have sparse=False as default. I feel like by "default" columnar heterogeneous data is not sparse, and the current default might make data that's dense sparse because of the use in ColumnTransformer. Actually in all examples I gave in #10603 I made this mistake and sparsified dense data :-/
That would make the new behavior even more different from the past, but I think now would be a good time to change that if we want.
