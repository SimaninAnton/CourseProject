I followed the instruction at this page (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html) to download scikit-learn repo to my local computer to create a new function called NestedCV_GridSearch. However, when I test run the function, it's not importing it from my local repo directory, I think it's importing from the default Python package sklearn. What do I need to do to set the paths so it would import from the local repo files?
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "model_selection/tests/test_search.py", line 46, in <module>
    from sklearn.model_selection import NestedCV_GridSearch
ImportError: cannot import name 'NestedCV_GridSearch' from 'sklearn.model_selection' (/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/__init__.py)
