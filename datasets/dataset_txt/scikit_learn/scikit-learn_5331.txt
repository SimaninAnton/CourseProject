When I run
nosetests sklearn
everything looks fine, If I do
nosetests sklearn/svm/tests/
I get an error in test_sparse.py, but when I do
nosetests sklearn/svm/tests/test_sparse.py
I get no error.
I guess this has something to do with the shuffling of the dataset or other random things.
I thought the way it is written the shuffling is done once and for all for all the tests so I don't really understand how this can happen. Any ideas?
