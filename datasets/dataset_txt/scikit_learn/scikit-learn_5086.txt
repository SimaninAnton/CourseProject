In sklearn.tree and sklearn.ensemble.forest, feature importances are computed when .fit is called. This feature is enabled with the compute_importances arguments. Results are stored in self.feature_importances_.
Conversely in sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting, feature_importances_ is an object property which computes feature importances on the fly.
Consistency would be nice. The discussion is opened.
This was brought into consideration in #1388.
