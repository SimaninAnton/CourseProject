Right now the documentation of make_column_transformer is pretty bare-bones, it doesn't even really describe the arguments.
We should probably link more explicitly to the ColumnTransformer docs. We should also link to the user guide.
Alternatively we could copy and paste the ColumnTransformer docs, but we need a link to the user guide either way.
