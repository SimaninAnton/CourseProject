ValueError: The constant target value must be present in training data
We could add in the error message what constant value was provided (in this case not-in-dataset) and what the possible values are. This could be something like this (improvement more than welcome):
The constant target value must be present in the training data.
You provided: constant='not-in-dataset'. Possible values are: ['class1'].
Context: this was seen during the EuroScipy tutorial. The adult census dataset classes has a space in it at the beginning <=50K and the provided value did not have the space. Putting what the provided value was and what were the possible values would have helped the user fixing the problem.
