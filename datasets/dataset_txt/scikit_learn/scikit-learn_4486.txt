It appears to be the case that SVR coefficients have their sign flipped incorrectly. The following line of code is flipping libsvm coefficients for binary classifiers (since libsvm assumes the first class is +1). I think there just needs to be an extra check to make sure the model is not SVR:

This is related to #630.
