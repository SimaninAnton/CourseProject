pip freeze returns scikit-learn and version number.
pkgutil.iter_modules() returns sklearn. This function returns a tuple. 2nd item [1] is name.
This made testing for successful installation and uninstallation from inside a module a bit annoying. Probably should use the exact same string in both places.
minor.
