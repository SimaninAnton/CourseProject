Docbuild is broken in fresh repositories which have not done a build before...
Exception occurred:
  File "/volatile/accounts/kkastner/scikit-learn/doc/sphinxext/gen_rst.py", line 637, in generate_dir_rst
    with open(include_path, 'a' if seen else 'w') as ex_file:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/volatile/accounts/kkastner/scikit-learn/doc/auto_examples/../modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.examples'
The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-rbzxm3fc.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
To fix this, I had to do:
mkdir doc/modules/generated
mkdir doc/generated
It should be a simple fix but I am unsure how/where it should go.
