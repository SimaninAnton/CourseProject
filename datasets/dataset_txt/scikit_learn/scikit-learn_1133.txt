When the following code is executed:
Y = discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=2).fit_transform(X, y)
for a 2-class problem the following is returned:
  File "C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm 2018.1.4\helpers\pydev\pydev_run_in_console.py", line 52, in run_file
    pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script
  File "C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm 2018.1.4\helpers\pydev\_pydev_imps\_pydev_execfile.py", line 18, in execfile
    exec(compile(contents+"\n", file, 'exec'), glob, loc)

  File "C:/Users/Omar/clustering_LDA_all_experiment/motion_color_given_area_all_plot_function.py", line 60, in feature_visualization_aug_2018
    plt.scatter(Y[:, 0], Y[:, 1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap("jet", classes))
IndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1
A 1-D vector is returned when a 2-D vector should be returned
Are there currently any workaround this issue?
