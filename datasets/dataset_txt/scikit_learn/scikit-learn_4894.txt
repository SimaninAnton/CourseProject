The grid_search module now supports a list of grids, and a random-sampled parameter space, and may in the future support other search algorithms. The shared purpose is: tuning (or exploring) hyper-parameters under cross-validation. So perhaps the grid_search name should be deprecated and replaced with something like:
cv_search (or search_cv)
hyperparams
model_selection (thanks @amueller)
