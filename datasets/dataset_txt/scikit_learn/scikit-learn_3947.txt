x, y, w = make_data()
SGDClassifier(shuffle=True).fit(x, y, sample_weight=w)
When data-derived weights are supplied, training with shuffle=True leads to higly non-stable results (very different on each run). As far as I understand, shuffle is applied to training data (x, y) only, not the weights w.
