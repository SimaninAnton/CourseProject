In the documentation for SparsePCA, the link to "[Jen09] | “Structured Sparse Principal Component Analysis” R. Jenatton, G. Obozinski, F. Bach, 2009" is
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/sspca_AISTATS2010.pdf
rather than
https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/sspca_AISTATS2010.pdf
although the decomposition.rst file looks fine to me. I checked this in firefox and chrome, so it seems like something is going wrong during documentation generation.
