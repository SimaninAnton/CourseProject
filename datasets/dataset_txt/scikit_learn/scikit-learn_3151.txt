If multiple targets were fitted, the method "predict" in the GaussianProcess class does not return an MSE of shape (n_eval, n_targets) . It only returns a MSE of shape (n_eval, ). This is clear from the source code block for the MSE evaluation, batch mode or not, where MSE is initialized as np.zeros(n_eval)
Also the writeup for this method has an error. If the input X has a shape stated as (n_eval, n_features), the shape of the returned y should be "(n_eval, ) or (n_eval, n_targets)" not "(n_samples, ) or (n_samples, n_targets)" as stated. Of course if one did not intend to return a MSE for each target, as currently is the case, then the description for y should be altered to reflect this.
