HI,
I want to make some analytics on the rabbitMQ queue. is it possible to make using .net code. I want to use sql queries for data analytics on RabbitMQ queue.
Suppose a number of deviecs sending data(like Country,State,Temperature..) on a shared RAbbitMQ queue. Now i want to filter the data like number of device which send data from INDIA State Delhi and temperature greater than 35. In this case should i consume them all the message and set custom logic for each message.
