Hi, yesterday I was browsing the scikit-learn code to acquaint myself with the codebase. I came across this piece of documentation in the HMM module:
"""
The :mod:`sklearn.hmm` module implements hidden Markov models.

**Warning:** :mod:`sklearn.hmm` is orphaned, undocumented and has known
numerical stability issues. If nobody volunteers to write documentation and
make it more stable, this module will be removed in version 0.11.
"""
As the current version is 0.14, I guess this comment should either be removed or updated to reflect the current status of the HMM module.
