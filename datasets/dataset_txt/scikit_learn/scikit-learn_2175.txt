There seem to be enough problems with multiprocessing on python 2 that you have a FAQ entry for it.
Two questions:
Considering that every user who runs into this will likely spend hours before finding that FAQ entry... would it be possible to issue a well visible up-front warning in likely cases?
Would you consider SCOOP (http://scoop.readthedocs.io) as an alternative? It transparently scales out to multiple compute nodes (starting workers via ssh) or whole clusters (e.g., with slurm support). To do that it can't rely on fork, but instead actually spawns independent python processes.
