In sklearn/tests/test_multiclass.py we should be testing for:
identical results given: sequence of sequences, binarized with neg_label=0, binarized with neg_label=-1
the edge case where all entries have the same number of labels
ensure it works with sub-samples, via cross_val_score
(Writing the tests should be easy; making them pass may not be.)
