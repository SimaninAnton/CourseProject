from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
X, y = make_blobs()
neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)
neighbors.fit(X)
neighbors.kneighbors(X)

TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
This should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised (or we could be lenient and cast to integer, but I think a better error might be better).
We need to make sure that
neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)
also works.
