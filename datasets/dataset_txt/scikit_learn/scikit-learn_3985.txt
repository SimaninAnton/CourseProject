make_multilabel_classification could accept max_labels to restrict the maximum number of labels per sample. This could be useful to further control the generated dataset.
@amueller and @jnothman WDYT?
Before -
>>> make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=5, n_features=3,  n_labels=2,
                                   allow_unlabeled=False, random_state=0)[1]
[[0, 1, 2, 4], [1], [1], [0, 1], [0]]
After -
>>> make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=5, n_features=3,  n_labels=2, max_labels=3,
                                   allow_unlabeled=False, random_state=0)[1]
[[0, 1, 2], [1], [1], [0, 1], [0]]
Another option would be to control the distribution from which y_size is chosen ( currently fixed poisson ).
