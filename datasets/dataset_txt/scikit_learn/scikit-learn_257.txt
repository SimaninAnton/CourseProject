The sponsor page on the scikit-learn website needs to be updated in particular with references to the scikit-learn Consortium, but probably other recent funding are missing?
The logo footer on the homepage probably needs to be updated too?
WDYT?
Do you mind if I collect the necessary information and propose a PR?
SVG logos are also welcome...
