Symptoms:
The first plot in section 2.1.2.1 links to http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm.html while it should just link to http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_concentration_prior.html as the 2nd plot correctly does (both 1st and 2nd plot are from the example at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_concentration_prior.html)
The 3rd plot is the only one that should link to http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm.html
