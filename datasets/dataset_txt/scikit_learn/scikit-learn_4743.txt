The new RBM has a few public methods with very specific and non-obvious names: gibbs and pseudo_likelihood. Do we want to rename these?
I discussed with @vene and we agreed that gibbs could be called something like reconstruct or sample_reconstruct. I suggested pseudo_likelihood is a variant of score, but it returns per-sample scores instead of a summary statistic.
