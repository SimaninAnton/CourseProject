Description
From this StackOverflow question:
Is it possible to add another encoder that fits to
features = [['a', 'dog', 'red'], ['b', 'cat', 'green']]
and does all the work necessary to transform it to
transformed_features = [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
It will basically be a One Hot encoder that works on objects other than integers
