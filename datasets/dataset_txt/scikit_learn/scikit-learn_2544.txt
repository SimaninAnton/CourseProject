QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis has a parameter named store_covariances.
LinearDiscriminantAnalysis has a parameter named store_covariance.
One of these parameter names should be changed to the other (with a deprecation cycle)
Edit on 2016-12-27. I now see a few related issues in the code:
QDA also has the attribute covariances_ instead of covariance_. This should also be made consistent, i.e. another deprecation.
store_covariances is a parameter to QDA, but is listed, with tol, incorrectly under Attributes in the docstring
store_covariance only has an effect in LDA if solver is svd. Otherwise covariance_ is stored anyway.
The effect of store_covariance is clearly not tested and should be.
I am also leaning towards store_covariance rather than store_covariances.
