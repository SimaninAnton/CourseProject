Description
The scoring step here has swapped the X and y (estimator applied is a identity_estimator)
The signature of scorer is
scorer(estimator, X, y)
But the current state is the following:
out = [scorer(identity_estimator, y.ravel(), cv_values[:, i])
                   for i in range(len(self.alphas))]
where y is the true values and cv_values[:, i ] is the X.
The probable reason for missing this order could be the ordering in usual scoring function is
(y_true, y_pred). I am just guessing.
Please let me know, If I am missing something.
