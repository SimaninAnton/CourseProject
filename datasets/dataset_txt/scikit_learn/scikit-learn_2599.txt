Is it possible to add output options to http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html. It would be really useful to have a pd.DataFrame output or xr.DataArray output. Right now it outputs as a string that must be printed but it's difficult to use the results. I can make a quick helper script if that could be useful?
