Hi,
If I have a relatively large dataset with multiple Y values for a single X value, I am unable to use a GaussianProcess to perform a regression on the dataset.
The error is:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/gaussian_process/gaussian_process.py", line 300, in fit
    raise Exception("Multiple input features cannot have the same"
Exception: Multiple input features cannot have the same target value.
Is there any reason for this? Thanks in advance
