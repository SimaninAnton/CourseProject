Description
Just ran a make linkcheck on the docs, and found quite a few that were broken. Results can be found here: https://gist.github.com/nelson-liu/ec9993a5461cb06430637d820d5c4ffa
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Run make linkcheck in the docs/ directory.
Expected Results
No broken links would be nice :)
Actual Results
A slew of broken links (ctrl+f "Broken"). Use grep to find where they are in the docs.
