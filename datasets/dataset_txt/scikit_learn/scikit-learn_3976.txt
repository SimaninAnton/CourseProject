We should remove mutable default arguments as much as sensibly possible.
You can find some using the landscape.io bot: https://landscape.io/github/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/51/messages/error?page=3#errors
Or even better with a test now: in #4379
The default value should be replace by None and then replaced by the actual value in fit.
This is a good fit for GSoC / first time contributors.
