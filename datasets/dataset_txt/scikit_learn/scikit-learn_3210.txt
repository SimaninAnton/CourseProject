It would be convenient for me if GridSearchCV objects had attribute classes_ after fitting. Here is a minimal example of something that I would like to do, which does not work currently:
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_classification
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=20, n_features=5, random_state=0)
clf = GradientBoostingClassifier()
clf.fit(X,y)
clf.classes_  # works

clf = GridSearchCV(GradientBoostingClassifier(), {'max_depth':[2,3,4]})
clf.fit(X,y)
clf.classes_  # does not work
I think this could be accomplished by copying the attribute from the self.best_estimator_ when it is created, and if so, I can make a pull request. But let me know if it is more complicated, or undesired.
