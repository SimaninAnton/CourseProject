Description
Hi,
I would like to know how you optimize / choose the default hyperparameter values in a learning machine. For example, when I initialize a randomforest classifier without specifying any hyperparameter,
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf has already bootstrap=True, max_depth=None, etc. How are these default values determined? Can you please point me to some references?

Thanks!
