Sklearn throws an error "Cannot import name check_arrays" when importing sklearn.svm.
I have searched the issue and another question suggested that check_arrays has been replaced with check_array. It seems like the old check_arrays is used by some code called form svm.
I have tested this and replacing imports (from check_arrays to check_array) in:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/cluster/bicluster/bicluster_metrics.py
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/cluster/bicluster/spectral.py
seems to have fixed the issue.
Running versions: sklearn - 0.17.1, python - 2.3.7, numpy - 1.6.1, scipy - 0.9.0
Traceback:
