In clone there is a lot of testing going on, but it seems to me that doesn't catch all important cases.
Also, these tests are not unit-tested.
Do we really want to do these tests at runtime instead of in the unit tests?
And if so, how can we improve them? Maybe we should look into the dict?
All parameters that are not init parameters should either be internal (starting with _) or estimated (_) - maybe ....
so that would be easy to check.
