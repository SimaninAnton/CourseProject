Description
I am new to scikit but I am pretty sure this is a bug as it is abnormal to anything else I have used and have not been able to find any solution to this online, sorry if I am posting in the wrong place.
When following the link below I have created the SVM and saved the model using joblib.dump.
https://code.oursky.com/tensorflow-svm-image-classifications-engine/
Steps/Code to Reproduce
    if os.path.exists(model_output_path):
        joblib.dump(clf.best_estimator_, model_output_path)
    else:
        print("Cannot save trained svm model to {0}.".format(model_output_path))
I then load it in another script (it is successfully saved) with the following:
joblib.load(model_output_path);
Expected Results
The model should be loaded so I can predict against it, the entire training process should not be run by using joblib.load (As far as I am aware)
Actual Results
It literally runs the whole training script, ( I am not using joblib.load inside the training script I am in a completely different folder and the training module is not included) It seems that the dump did not save the output but the actual code to rerun the training. In other words, it is as if I ran my train.py file.

This happens on my Mac and also RPI 3, the details for RPI 3 which I am now working on are as follows ( sorry I am actually using Python 3.
