Transformers generally work with a single data argument (often X) and sometimes additional parameters. As far as I can see, whenever X and y are both arguments to transform, the y goes unused. To make the API clearer all such instances of y should be removed, though perhaps deprecated (see http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/#deprecation) to avoid TypeErrors where users have passed in a value for y redundantly.
