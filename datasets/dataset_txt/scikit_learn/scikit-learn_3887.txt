I have X_training data looking like the following:
['this is the first document',
'this is the second document',
'this is the third document'] -- essentially a list of string
y_train data like the following:
[['1409108', '1501079', '1335609', '1335703', '1342230', '1335530', '1335602', '1342114', '1335851', '1355623', '1342299', '1342278', '1335804', '1342189', '1351217'], ['1404708', '5101079', '1335609', '1335703', '1342230', '1335530', '1453602', '13422214', '1335851', '1355623', '1345299', '1342278', '1335804', '1342189', '1351217']] -- essentially a list of list, where each list within is a list of topic
X_train and y_train has the same length, each string in X correpsonds to a list of topic in y.
I am trying to use the pipeline [('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()), ('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(LinearSVC()))] to develop a model on the X_train and y_train data, while the system prompts the above error.
lb = preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer()
y_indicator = lb.fit_transform(y_train)
clf = Pipeline([
('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(LinearSVC()))
])
clf.fit(X_train, y_indicator)
I've seen similar issues posted here and I'm not sure if this is the version issue, but I'll post them here anyway...
scipy/intel/0.13.3
scikit-learn/intel/0.15.1
scikit-learn/intel/0.15.2
I'm running my program on nyu hpc server(mercer) so i'm not really sure what's the platform version here. I used to run my program on anaconda locally (python 2.7.9, with every packages updated to date) and they turned out to be completely fine.
I really appreciate your help!
Thanks!
