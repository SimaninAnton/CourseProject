RidgeClassifier inherits from the RegressorMixin, but not from the ClassifierMixin.
This is cause by inheriting from Ridge, which is a LinearModel, which is a regressor.
My thoughts on this for the moment:
Maybe LinearModel should be renamed to LinearRegressor?
There should probably be a BaseRidge class, from which both, regressor and classifier can inherit.
btw: the other linear classifiers (SGDClassifier and Logistic) don't inherit from LinearModel - which seemed a bit odd to me before I realized that LinearModel is for regression only.
