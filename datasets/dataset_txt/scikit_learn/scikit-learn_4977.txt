The handling of 1d input should be consistent in all estimators. I think currently 1d X is assumed to be of shape (1, n_features) - and even that might fail sometimes. That needs to be checked and needs to be consistent across all estimators.
Also, all estimators that don't support nd-input (I'm not sure any do or should do?) need to raise an appropriate error.
