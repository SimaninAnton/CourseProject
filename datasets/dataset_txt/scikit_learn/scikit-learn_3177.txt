Calling KMeans.fit over 1d data will raise ValueError: n_samples=1 should be >= n_clusters=3 even if the samples are plenty more than 3 (n_cluster==3 in this example).
The problem in _check_fit_data comes from X = check_array(X, accept_sparse='csr', dtype=np.float64) where if X.shape is (512,), the call to check_array will return (1, 512) and thus raise the error.
The 1d input case should be corrected either to raise an exception for such input, or to be properly treated (albeit weird, KMeans is still defined in 1d).
