Up to my recent investigation, scikit-learn only have Restricted Boltzmann machines for initializing deep neural networks.
Do scikit-learn team have any plan to add more models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)? I know keras is available but scikit-learn has more clear and simpler syntax
I'm not sure my question sounds weird but I'm much get used to scikit-learn. Thanks @norbert @ynd @eggie5
