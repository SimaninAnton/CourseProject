 def partial_fit(self, X, y, classes=None, sample_weight=None): 
Curious to know the reason, because if I do just one epoch for every new batch of data, the chances of finding the minimal value of cost function is very low
my intuition for the reason to set max_iter to 1 for partial_fit() is, you dont want the training batches to significantly affect the weights(ex: for a new batch of 20 samples I set max_iter=1000). Is that the case or any other reason?
