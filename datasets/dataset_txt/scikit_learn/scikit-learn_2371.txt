** I am importing sklearn module from Ipython console. Getting below error while trying to import:**
ImportError Traceback (most recent call last)
in ()
----> 1 import sklearn
c:\python27\lib\site-packages\sklearn_init_.py in ()
54 # process, as it may not be compiled yet
55 else:
---> 56 from . import __check_build
57 from .base import clone
58 __check_build # avoid flakes unused variable error
ImportError: cannot import name __check_build
I have tried updating scipy as advised in different forums, the issue still persists
