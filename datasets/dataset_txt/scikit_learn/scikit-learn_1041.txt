problem
I am trying to get the nmf_missing branch to compile without success, as per this suggestion.
The compiler error:
On branch nmf_missing after issuing make at the command line it build largely fine until the following error (The first one I know of, although several warnings):
error: Command "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -pthread -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fno-strict-aliasing -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -fPIC -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/include/python2.7 -c sklearn/neighbors/quad_tree.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/sklearn/neighbors/quad_tree.o -MMD -MF build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/sklearn/neighbors/quad_tree.o.d" failed with exit status 1
Makefile:24: recipe for target 'inplace' failed
How I think this can be solved(?)
It seems to come from trying to compile the following line in quad_tree.c (3582) printf(__pyx_k_QuadTree_found_a_duplicate);. I have tried commenting out this line but whenever I type make it reverts the change. Hence I have tried tracking down what is producing either this file, or whatever is producing the compiler flags -Wformat -Werror=format-security which is causing the compiler to throw the error. However, trying to track the origin of these has proved too much and I am lost.
