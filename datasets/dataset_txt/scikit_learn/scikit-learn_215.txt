We recently merged https://github.com/NicolasHug/scikit-learn/blob/master/examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_0_22_0.py to summarise the highlights of 0.22, to be released in early November.
More release highlights, briefly demonstrating the new thing in action, belong in that example doc:
Permutation based feature importance
HistGradientBoostingClassifier with missing data
Plotting API
Tree pruning
fetch_openml's as_frame
? Changed behaviour in StratifiedKFold
precomputed sparse neighborhoods, e.g. for SpectralClustering or manifold learning, with KNeighborsTransformer
StackingClassifier or StackingRegressor
parametrize_with_checks
KNNImputer and nan_euclidean_distances
?Multiclass roc_auc_score
? Improved performance of multimetric scoring
? CategoricalNB
Priority here should be given, IMO, to:
things that will be popular (i.e. much anticipated, or people have gone elsewhere for these features)
things that people will miss otherwise (hence the inclusion of parametrize_with_checks)
