Describe the issue linked to the documentation
As mentioned in #12509 (comment), the classes_ attributed is not documented in some classifiers.
It would be great to use this test:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12509/files#diff-61cf7ce5b6dcf8855cf4ad342fb9e45a
and fix the issues in the classifiers where classes_ is still missing. Running this test on master, I found these classes were missing the documentation for the classes_ attribute:
sklearn.utils._mocking.CheckingClassifier (probably can be skipped because it is used just for tests)
sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier
sklearn.multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier
sklearn.ensemble.StackingClassifier
Maybe @judithabk6 if you are still at the Paris sprint it would be a good one to tackle for you?
