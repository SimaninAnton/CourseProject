Saw this piece of code when reading the implementation of VotingClassifier
if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and len(y.shape) > 1 and y.shape[1] > 1:                                           
        raise NotImplementedError('Multilabel and multi-output'                                                     
                                                     ' classification is not supported.')                                              
Is this due to some blocker or challenge? Thanks
