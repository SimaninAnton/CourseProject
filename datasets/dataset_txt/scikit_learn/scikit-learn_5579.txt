I have been trying to get the latest version of scikits-learn on to Ubuntu 64 bit system, but I get the following errors when I try to "make" or "python setup.py build_ext --inplace".
The error is
collect2: ld terminated with signal 11 [Segmentation fault]
and
error: Command "gcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.6/cd_fast.o -lcblas -o ./cd_fast.so" failed with exit status 1
I am not sure, what dependencies I need to install . I tried a lot but couldn't figure it out. It would be really helpful if I get the latest version of scikits working on my system.
Thanks a lot for all your time and help.
