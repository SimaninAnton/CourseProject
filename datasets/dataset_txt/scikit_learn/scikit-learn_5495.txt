Even though, SVC uses one-vs-one training internally, the shape of dual_coef_ is [n_classes-1, nSV] and not [n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2, nSV] as one may expect. It would be nice if someone (@fabianp? @amueller?) competent on the subject could add some more explanations.
If I understood correctly, this representation allows to factorize the alphas with respect to a given support vector and thus precompute a few summations at training time (instead of doing the entire voting at predict time).
I don't understand why it's n_classes-1 and not n_classes.
This FAQ may help too.
