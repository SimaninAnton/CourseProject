This is a sequel to #3830. Those are improvements identified by @jnothman to improve the PDF output of running the make latexpdf command in the doc folder.
there is a couple of useless blank pages before the first chapter
there should be a table-of-contents
there seem to be many chapters that should really be sections of other chapters (e.g. the one on fetching covertype; changelong entries)
what would be thumbnails corresponding to examples on the web site show up as duplicated images in the examples themselves, as well as as in the examples associated with each class/function in the reference
assume within-documentation references should be hyperlinked, but do not seem to be in cases where I've looked
