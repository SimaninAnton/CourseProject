The contributor docs on deprecations could do with some improvements:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#deprecation
The deprecation warning should always give both the version in which the change will happen, as well as the version in which the deprecation happened, like
        warnings.warn("'k' was renamed to n_clusters in version 0.13 and will "
                      "be removed in 0.15.",
                      DeprecationWarning)
We should also add a note on what the deprecation cycle is, in particular since I'm prone to one-off errors.
So if the Stable is version 0.x and dev is 0.(x+1)-dev then the deprecation should end in 0.(x+2), right?
So currently we are on 0.17 and 0.18-dev and current changes are deprecations till 0.19, right, not 0.20?
