Description
I think it would be nice if confusion_matrix function would have a boolean parameter tabulate and if the user passes it to be True then the function :
A.) Either prints a tabulated matrix and return a ndarray of confusion matrix as well.
B.) Return just the tabulated object.
I think A option is better as it provides more flexibility and reusability.
If the members and developers think it feasible, I myself would like to add and contribute to this feature.
