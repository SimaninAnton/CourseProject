Description
The link in documentation is dead here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a24c8b46/sklearn/decomposition/online_lda.py#L260
I have a proposal to prevent these:
copy all websites, articles, code, link's content, if legally possible, to scikit-learn.org servers and keep them there, because, unfortunately, academia people are usually terrible in keeping things alive
add a simple script to a test suite which would crawl all documentation references, gathered all the links and tried to GET them and check if the code is 200 or something. This would point out to dead links.
