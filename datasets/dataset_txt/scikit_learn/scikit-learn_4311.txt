I propose to refactor the input validation. The current zoo of methods is kinda confusing.
Related to #3142.
Checks that we want are:
numpy array vs sparse vs list vs anything indexable
sparse matrix type
inf / nan
dtype
ndims
number of samples is consistent in multiple arrays.
contiguous
I'll now check if there is anything else that we currently check and see what functions we have.
Remaining Issues
possibly remove "make_float_array" and "1d_or_column" and also make these options of check_array.
Currently "ensure2d" makes vectors into rows, which I find pretty counter-intuitive. This is for backward compatibility. 1d input is not currently handled consistently.
