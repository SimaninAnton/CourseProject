It looks like Tree.compute_feature_importances has confused terminology:
        if method == "gini":
            method = lambda node: (self.n_samples[node] * \
                                     (self.init_error[node] -
                                      self.best_error[node]))
        elif method == "squared":
            method = lambda node: (self.init_error[node] - \
                                   self.best_error[node]) ** 2.0
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                'Invalid value for method. Allowed string '
                'values are "gini", or "mse".')
Should it be squared to match the code and docstring, or mse to match the ValueError?
Probably best would be to fix the error text so as not to break any code that depends on "squared"... even though "mse" is used in other places?
