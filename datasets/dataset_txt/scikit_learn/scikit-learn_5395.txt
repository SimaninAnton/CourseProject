Beginning at line 89 of grid_search.py, there is the following code:
    if isinstance(X, list) or isinstance(X, tuple):
        X_train = [X[i] for i, cond in enumerate(train) if cond]
        X_test = [X[i] for i, cond in enumerate(test) if cond]
as far as I can tell, train and test are generated by a KFold or StratifiedKFold objects, which means that train and test are arrays of integers specifying indices. However, in the code above, they are being treated as arrays of boolean (selector arrays). The point of these two lines is to convert the array of booleans to an array of indices---however this is unncessary and is only creating an error here. Because all non-zero valued integers evaluate to True, X_train and X_test might include nearly all of the rows in X.
I therefore think that these two lines are unnecessary and causing an error. But maybe I'm missing something.
