Make transparent interface to work with big data.
1.default support of hdf5 files as numpy arrays (pointer to hdf5 file on disk can be passed to function as simple numpy array)
2.analize size of data and if it can't fit in memory, process it by chunks.
Some algorithms now have method partial_fit it helps a lot, but for example KNeighborsClassifier have none.
