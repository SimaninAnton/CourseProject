Hi,
I would like to use the algorithm cheat sheet below
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/doc/images/ml_map.png
for a report I am preparing for my university grad course. I intend to host the report at one of my github repos and use a python notebook for that.
Could you please let me know if it is ok to use the image, even with modifications (I want to show a cropped portion of it) and what are the licensing requirements? I am planning to cite the scikit paper on the reference section of my report.
Thank you,
Fabio
