The overhead of getting scikit-learn and build it from source, just to use simple metric functions like multilabel_confusion_matrix could be avoided if :
a new version was released on pip or if
you create a specific branch for the current 0.21 dev version (non existent), and a single command like "pip install git+git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git@0.21 " would be enough for installing.
