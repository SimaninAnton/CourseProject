Hi,
I want to address sklearn documention.
It is really nicely designed and informative, as it is to be expected from Sphinx documentation and careful docstrings, but seeing Google custom search instead Sphinx full-text search is surprising. I guess you are too excited with Google Analytics, but seeing Google ads in search results looks very cheap and unnecessary, when you have better search based on your documentation generator. Anyone can always parse your documentation with custom Google search, anyways.
Ahem it's your project, but at the same time public, so there goes my 2c.
