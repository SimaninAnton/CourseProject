ridge.py ~line 80
basically RidgeClassifier creates sampleweight VECTOR of 1s by default]
and
has_sw = isinstance(sample_weight, np.ndarray) or sample_weight != 1.0
....
if has_sw:
solver = 'dense_cholesky'
which meands that the normal cholesky solver is always used (when you don't enter any sample weights)
