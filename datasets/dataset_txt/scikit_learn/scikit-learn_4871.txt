as reported by Shishir Pandey here
I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "C:\Users\xyz\ml\svm_gui.py", line 30, in <module>
     from sklearn.externals.six.moves import xrange
ImportError: No module named six.moves
This error is for sklearn version 0.13.1 I am assuming six.move might be
added to 0.14 version. Because the link I used was for the dev version
of sklearn -
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/applications/svm_gui.html#example-applications-svm-gui-py
Whats new about xrange in six.moves?
