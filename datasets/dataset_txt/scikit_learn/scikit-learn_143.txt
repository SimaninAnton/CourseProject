I discovered that make_circles and make_moons from sklearn.datasets lack ability to create unbalanced data sets. This is somehow inconsistent with make_blobs which allows that.
Proposal
Allow passing directly a two-element tuple as n_samples argument. It would be unpacked as (n_samples_in, n_samples_out) and could be used like this:
make_circles(n_samples=(80, 20))
This is very similar to #8617, but for circles and moons
I have a code working, I could add tests and docs, and create pull request. What do you think? I opened this issue in order to get some feedback.
