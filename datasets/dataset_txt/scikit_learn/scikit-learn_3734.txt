The 'loss' parameter for linearSVC used to be 'l1' or 'l2'. This was recently changed to 'hinge' or 'squared_hinge', according to the documentation. However, supplying those as parameters gives a very unhelpful error (which I believe misidentifies the loss parameter as the penalty parameter, since I'm not even touching the latter):
ValueError: Unsupported set of arguments: penalty='l1' is only supported when dual='false'., Parameters: penalty='l2', loss='squared_hinge', dual=True
If, instead, I change back to loss='l2' it appears to work just fine.
I believe this recent Stackoverflow question concerns the same issue:
