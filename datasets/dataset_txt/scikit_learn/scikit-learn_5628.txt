I've been so bold as to change the tagline of this repo to "scikit-learn: machine learning in Python" instead of "scikit-learn main repo". The reason is that, when a user clones the repo, the tagline is copied along so we get lots of repos labeled "main repo" scattered across Github. I figured this might be confusing for casual users who are not familiar with Git(Hub).
I've also updated my own repo's tagline, please update yours.
