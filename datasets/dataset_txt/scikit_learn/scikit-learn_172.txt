Description
As part of updating documentation for #15489 it appears NearestNeighbors constructor contains all parameters of NeighborsBase and also has an unnecessarily **kwargs being passed through.
class NearestNeighbors(NeighborsBase, KNeighborsMixin,
                       RadiusNeighborsMixin, UnsupervisedMixin):
    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=5, radius=1.0,
                 algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, metric='minkowski',
                 p=2, metric_params=None, n_jobs=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
              n_neighbors=n_neighbors,
              radius=radius,
              algorithm=algorithm,
              leaf_size=leaf_size, metric=metric, p=p,
              metric_params=metric_params, n_jobs=n_jobs, **kwargs)
[...]


class NeighborsBase(MultiOutputMixin, BaseEstimator, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base class for nearest neighbors estimators."""
