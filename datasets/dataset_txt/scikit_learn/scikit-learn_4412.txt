According to the docs. The random seed for a forest is the seed used by np.random.
However, the following:
np.random.seed(0)
do_cv(clf) # Where clf is a forest
does not yield same results. If random_state is explicitly set then all is good in the world.
It would be great if np.random.seed(seed_value) was the global seed for sklearn, just set once and forget.
