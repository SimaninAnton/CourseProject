In the documentation of SGD , the learn rate heuristic is now explained pretty well.
The only part that is missing is how to choose t_0. For this, a presentation is referenced. As far as I can tell, the heuristic that is actually used is not in the presentation. It would be good to give a pointer to the place in the code (in linear_mode/base.py), where the actual computation is happening.
I just spend some time trying to find that piece of code, when I tried to explain to a student what the heuristic actually does.
Without knowing what to look for, it is quite hard to find out what is happening.
