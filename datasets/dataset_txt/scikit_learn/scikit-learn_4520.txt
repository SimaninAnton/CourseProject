Hello guys.
Let suppose I have a categorical feature, 10 records (10 rows), 4 possible values.
X = [[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1]]
I use: n_values=[[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]].
It gives me an array, which I reshape to (10,4) but the last three rows are mistaken. Furthermore if I change the last value (1) in a 4, I get the error "column index exceedes matrix dimensions".
Now, it works perfectly if instead of that X, I use X = [[1],[2], [3], [3], [2], [3], [4], [2], [1], [1]].
Is that normal or it's a bug?
