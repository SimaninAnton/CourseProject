Finding correct clustering parameters may benefit from a silhouette plot analysis, as used in the tutorial at http://au.mathworks.com/help/stats/k-means-clustering.html. We can calculate the required scores using silhouette_samples but do not have an example which shows how to turn this into the plot.
(Someone is welcome to tell me this technique is not used/useful in practice and has been superseded...)
