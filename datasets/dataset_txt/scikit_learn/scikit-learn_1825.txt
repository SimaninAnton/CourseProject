We currently use Travis to run unit tests with various versions of dependencies, including python 2. But we only run the examples when building the docs in python 3 with Circle CI. #9936 shows that this allows incompatible example code to be introduced, and I expect this to increase as more developers use python 3 though we still support python 2. Perhaps we should add a Travis run that builds the examples, whether or not it compiles the rest of the documentation.
