I've been reading the documentation for MinMaxScaler.
And a fragment there says:
The transformation is given by::
        X_std = (X - X.min(axis=0)) / (X.max(axis=0) - X.min(axis=0))
        X_scaled = X_std * (max - min) + min
Could it be that in the last line should be X_scaled = X_std * (max - min) - min ?
I have not read the source code. Easy to get lost. Does it do what it is supposed to do?
