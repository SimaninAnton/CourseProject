This page shows a great overview over different multiclass classification strategies.
I noticed that bothsklearn.svm.NuSVC, as well as sklearn.svm.SVC are still listed under OVO strategies, although the default is now a OVR strategy.
Maybe this can be indicated by either a "setting decision_function_shape='ovo', or moving them to another category.
