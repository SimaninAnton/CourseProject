The documentation currently says
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking down the
pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in parallel.
But the code instead does
if n_jobs == 1:
  for it in range(n_init):
    _kmeans_single(...)
else:
  Parallel(n_jobs=n_jobs)(delayed(_kmeans_single)(...) for it in range(n_init)

a better description about what the n_jobs parameter does would be
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by computing each of
the n_init runs in parallel.
I checked in the git log apparently the parallel kmeans never did the pairwise matrix calculation in parallel.
