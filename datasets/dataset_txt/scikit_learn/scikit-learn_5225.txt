I find the univariate feature selection example confusing.
It claims that the SVM assigns small weights to the significant features but to me it looks like it assigns very large weights.
Also: the y-axis is not labeled and it is not immediately clear to me what the meaning is (maybe because I'm not accustomed to seeing p-value plots).
Closer examination shows: scores_ actually stores the f-scores, not the p-values.
So the legend is wrong and the text misleading.
Also: maybe document scores_ and p_values attributes in the univariate feature selectors.
