We have a rather lengthy changelog. This is nice for searching through the whole thing for when some feature changed (especially as we're not very consistent with applying versionadded/changed tags), but it would be good to keep each version's what's new separate in the source (as pandas does, for instance):
it would allow you to search a single version's changes, to check for instance that some merged code had been documented there.
since version names would appear in the filenames, it would be easier to see that a PR is modifying the correct version's changelog.
There are other approaches; in any case, what's new is too long to manage for some tasks.
