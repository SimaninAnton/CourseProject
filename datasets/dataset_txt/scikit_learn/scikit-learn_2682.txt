This is more of a question then a bug report, at most it might be a feature request: Is it possible to compute the features, supplied to a decision tree during prediction, on demand rather than upfront?
For a few problems a feature space might be of high dimensionality, but for a given sample only a few features are actually used. So I'm wondering if it is possible to compute these features on a per-needs basis. This would save a lot of run time as well as memory.
This obviously doesn't apply to the training phase, to the testing only.
