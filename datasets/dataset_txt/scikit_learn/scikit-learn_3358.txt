The two images at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_nearest_centroid.html#example-neighbors-plot-nearest-centroid-py look identical to me. Are they meant to be different?
That is should changing shrink_threshold make some visible difference to the decision boundary in this case?
