Description
Hi all,
I'm writing regarding the example on topic extraction http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#example-applications-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py.
I believe there currently are 2 issues with the source code used in the example:
the n_features parameter is not taken into account when setting up the tf_idf vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.95, min_df=2, #max_features=n_features,
                                   stop_words='english')
there's an exit() statement right after fitting the NMF (this actually crashed my jupyter kernel when I executed the example):
nmf = NMF(n_components=n_topics, random_state=1, alpha=.1, l1_ratio=.5).fit(tfidf)
exit()
Could someone fix these two issues for future users?
If someone can point me to the file that needs fixing, I'd love to submit the patch myself (I couldn't find it by myself in the source).
Best regards,
Florian
