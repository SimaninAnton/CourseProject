Update the out of core example to plot the behavior of Perceptron, PassiveAggressiveClassifier and MultinomialNB on the Reuters dataset.
Write narrative documentation to explain the motivation, explain the partial_fit method usage in general and refer to the example in particular and give hints implementation constraints (stateless feature extraction, knowing all the classes ahead of time for classification).
Models to be linked to in this section:
For classification:
Perceptron
MultinomialNB
BernoulliNB
SGDClassifier
PassiveAggressiveClassifier
For regression:
SGDRegressor
PassiveAggressiveRegressor
For out of core clustering / feature extraction:
MinibatchKMeans
For out of core decomposition / feature extraction:
MinibatchDictionaryLearning
