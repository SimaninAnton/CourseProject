I'm encounteing a mysterious situation.
GridSearchCV doesn't finish when exec HTTP Request.
This code is a minimum implements.
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import urllib.request
import random

sample_num = 1400
dimension = 100

#Problem on below
with urllib.request.urlopen('http://python.org/') as response:
       html = response.read()

X = []
y = []

for i in range(0, sample_num):
    x = []
    for j in range(0, dimension):
        x.append(random.random())
    X.append(x)
    y.append(i%2)

print('start gscv')

tuned_parameters = [{'C': [10]}]
gscv = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(), tuned_parameters, cv=2, n_jobs=-1)
gscv.fit(X, y)

print('finished')
Above code works fine when
Comment out urllib.request.urlopen part.
Delete n_jobs option.
Decrease sample_num to 1300.
So I guess this problem is caused by parallel and http request.
What's happening?
Environment
Python 3.4.3
