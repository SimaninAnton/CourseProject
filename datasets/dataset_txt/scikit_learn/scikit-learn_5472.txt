Hi,
I am following the scikit-learn-tutorial. I got from the beginning to section 2.2.1 (A first classifier example with scikit-learn) without any issues, but am not able to make any more progress unfortunately:
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "C:\Python27-enthought\lib\site-packages\scikit_learn-0.11_git-py2.7-win-amd64.egg\sklearn\svm__init__.py", line 15, in
from . import sparse, libsvm, liblinear
ImportError: cannot import name sparse
I can, however, import the sparse class directly from scipy without any issues. i.e. from scipy import sparse works fine.
I don't know how to troubleshoot this issue. Your help would be much appreciated.
My environment is Windows 7 64 bit, Enthought Python 2.7 64 bit.
Thanks!
