I want to use scikit.cluster.Ward for group analysis. For one object it is straightforward to use the code bellow to fit one object ("fmri_masked") which is a 4D object.
Is it possible to do Ward clustering for a list of objects, that is, rather than 1 fmri scan a list of them ?
ward = FeatureAgglomeration(n_clusters, linkage='ward')
ward.fit(fmri_masked)
thanks
