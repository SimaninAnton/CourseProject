Description
preprocessing.StandardScaler takes arrays with shape [n_samples, n_features] as input. Preprocessing utilities in sklearn find use even in those applications which do not use sklearn estimators. Keeping in mind such usecases, it seems a little bit odd that the class restricts the input to 2 dimensions where it can be easily generalized to any number of dimensions.
I propose that the StandardScaler and for that matter other preprocessing utilities be modified to support inputs of any dimension.
