Hello,
I was running plot_sparse_cov.py in the following link.
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/covariance/plot_sparse_cov.html#example-covariance-plot-sparse-cov-py
and I got Segmentation fault when I modified number of samples and features much bigger than the original demo. (Demo file itself was OK.)
n_samples = 600
n_features = 200
Segmentation error is the following
/home/sanghee/.pyenv/versions/ds-2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/covariance/graph_lasso_.py:47: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in absolute
  - np.abs(np.diag(precision_)).sum())
Segmentation fault

real    0m0.428s
user    0m0.556s
sys 0m0.464s
However, GraphLasso did not make segmentation fault instead of GraphLassoCV.
After I changed BLAS from OpenBLAS to ATLAS, it still showed me RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in absolute - np.abs(np.diag(precision_)).sum()) triple times but I worked.
I have tested with Numpy 1.8.x , 1.9.x, and 1.10.x dev with OpenBLAS and still I have Segmentation fault. How can I solve this problem?
p.s., My environment
