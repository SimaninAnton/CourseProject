I'm trying to use the warm starting in the SGDClassifier.
I want to use the coef_ and intercept_ I got from an earlier training.
I'm doing binary classification and I get an intercept that is just a float (as expected).
In base.py in the sgd folder there is an assert
if intercept_init.shape â‰  (1,): [...]
But my numpy returns a shape of "()", throwing an exception. Does that depend on the numpy version or is that a bug in the code?
I'm using Numpy 1.5.1
