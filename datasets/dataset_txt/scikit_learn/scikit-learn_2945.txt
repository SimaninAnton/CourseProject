The basic KDTree example from the docs produces a DeprecatioinWarning (tested with 0.17.1):
X = np.random.random((10, 3))  # 10 points in 3 dimensions
tree = KDTree(X, leaf_size=2)
dist, ind = tree.query(X[0], k=3)
==>
[...]/lib/python3.4/site-packages/sklearn/utils/validation.py:386: DeprecationWarning:
Passing 1d arrays as data is deprecated in 0.17 and willraise ValueError in 0.19.
Reshape your data either using X.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or
X.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
  DeprecationWarning)
I'm not (yet) very familiar with scikit-learn. But doesn't it seem "wrong" to say "Passing 1d arrays as data is deprecated" when the X passed is actually 2d?
