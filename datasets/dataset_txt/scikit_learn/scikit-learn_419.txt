Description
The BaseEstimator class, within the sklearn.base module, should have a fit(X, y=None) method added to it.
This method is expected to exist in several places of the codebase (i.e. TransformerMixin and Pipeline). However, does not appear to be explicitly declared anywhere that it is required to exist (with the exception of the runtime errors caught at the usage boundaries, such as during Pipeline.fit()).
I have made comments in #8326, but I figured that I'd open up an issue specifically targeting this feature request.
