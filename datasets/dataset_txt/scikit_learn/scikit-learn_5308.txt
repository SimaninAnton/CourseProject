Before the tree speedup patch landed, I used to be able to get access to the clf.tree_.children, clf.tree_.features, clf.tree_.values, which contains the graph that was fit for inspection and/or external modification:
    children : np.ndarray, shape=(node_count, 2), dtype=int32
        `children[i, 0]` holds the node id of the left child of node `i`.
        `children[i, 1]` holds the node id of the right child of node `i`.
        For leaves `children[i, 0] == children[i, 1] == Tree.LEAF == -1`.

    feature : np.ndarray of int32
        The feature to split on (only for internal nodes).

    value : np.ndarray of float64, shape=(capacity, n_outputs, n_classes)
        Contains the constant prediction value of each node.
And maybe a couple others from the old pure python Tree class...
