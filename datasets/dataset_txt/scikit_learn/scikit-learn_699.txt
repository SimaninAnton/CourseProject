the Scikit-Learn Enhancement Proposal is mentioned in the recently merged Governance document (doc/governance.rst), but nowhere else I can see. The Governance doc is only mentioned in About. These are both things new contributors should be aware of. We should add:
SLEP and Scikit-learn Enhancment Proposal entries to doc/glossary.rst
mention of SLEP and the Governance documents to doc/developers/contributing.rst
