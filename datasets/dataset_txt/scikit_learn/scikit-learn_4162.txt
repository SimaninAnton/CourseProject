Hello. The current implementation of GMM.score_samples computes log-responsibilities, exponentiates them and then returns only the exponentiated version. I wonder if there is there a reason for that?
Having a way to extract log-responsibilities might improve the accuracy of more complex models built on top of GMM, for example GMMHMM.
