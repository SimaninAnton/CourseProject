When training an svm with SVC to predict the MNIST dataset (with 'ovr' method), I get the "right" (ie. expected) predictions for the indices of the test set which are also on the training set. For instance, suppose I train with 300:600 of the training set. Then only the predictions of the 300 to 600th rows of test are as expected. All the others are constant (even the decision_function results)!
I put a more detailed report here with a code example.
