I'm probably missing something here, but I'm trying to use Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction, however, when using transform, it's missing the xbar_ attribute. Which is computed in fit, which I obviously don't use as I don't have classes. Anything I'm missing here? It's friday and Oktoberfest, so my brain might be a tad slow. Any pointers greatly appreciated.
