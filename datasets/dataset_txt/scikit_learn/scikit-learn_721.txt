Not sure if there's an easy way around that but generate_authors_table.py doesn't allow using 2FA and the error is pretty cryptic. I guess using an OAuth token would be better than name+password?
That's also a bit of a hassle, though.
I'm not sure what the "try/except" at the top is supposed to accomplish, how can input and getpasswd throw an IndexError?
