It is a painful discovery for anyone who doesn't already know that some BLAS libraries are not fork safe. This combined with the fact that forking (as provided for by multiprocessing) is one of the most readily available mechanisms for Python developers to actively create and manage parallelism is constantly a problem. Of course, this is clearly stated in this warning.
A mention is made to Python 3.x escaping some of these issues (presumably using spawning as opposed to forking). While this isn't available in Python 2.7 or old versions of Python 3, there is a package that attempts to backport these features to Python versions that don't have multiprocessing at all or have an old versions of it. This package is called billiard and is nearing a release of these 3.4 features. I wonder if it would be worth trying a development version of billiard and seeing if that wouldn't help address some of these sorts of problems.
