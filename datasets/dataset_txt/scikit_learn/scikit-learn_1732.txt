run the example in http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_lof.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neighbors-plot-lof-py.
although it works, the code Z = clf._decision_function(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]) shows "Access ot a protected member _decision_function of a class...". something i think it is strange.
even not like c++ in objected-oriented program, i think in python if a class method accessed directly in program, it should be declared public instead of protected.
