Description
The example given for get_feature_names is not helpful to understand its complete functionality.
scikit-learn/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py
Lines 244 to 245 in 846e6a3
     >>> enc.get_feature_names() 
     array(['x0_Female', 'x0_Male', 'x1_1', 'x1_2', 'x1_3'], dtype=object) 
Something like the following would be more helpful.
>>> enc.get_feature_names(['gender', 'group'])
array(['gender_Female', 'gender_Male', 'group_1', 'group_2', 'group_3'],
      dtype=object)
Another feedback is that code block is divided into two, because of skip line in the example.
Same is the case with OrdinalEncoder. Not sure, whether we need to change them.
