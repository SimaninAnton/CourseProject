I cloned the repository and build using the following comamnd:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
However, the building process terminated with the following error:
building 'sklearn.cluster._dbscan_inner' extension

How can I let g++ link to vector header. I am using Mac OSX Yosemite. The following shows my g++ version, which is installed via Homebrew.
$ g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 5.1.0

Could anyone help me to get through this error?

I also tried to build it on my department's server, and it was successful. The following is the version of the compiler it used:
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-17)

So there must be something wrong with my OS. Could anyone point me in a right direction?
