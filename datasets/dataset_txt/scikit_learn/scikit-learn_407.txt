In file rfe.py, the RFE class inherits MetaEstimatorMixin
class RFE(BaseEstimator, MetaEstimatorMixin, SelectorMixin):
Then RFECV inherits RFE and also inherits MetaEstimatorMixin again.
class RFECV(RFE, MetaEstimatorMixin):
I tried to remove MetaEstimatorMixin from RFECV parents and everything seems to work fine. May it be a good idea to remove the duplicated inheritance?
