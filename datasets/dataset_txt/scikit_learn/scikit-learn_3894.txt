Currently, a deprecation warning is raised in sklearn/datasets/samples_generator.py - make_multilabel_classification which states:
Support for the sequence of sequences multilabel representation is being deprecated and replaced with a sparse indicator matrix. return_indicator will default to True from version 0.17.
Since this is 0.17, we should do it.
