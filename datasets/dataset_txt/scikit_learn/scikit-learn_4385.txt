I had an issue compiling sklearn on my new mac. The issue has to do with clang and is documented elsewhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22313407/clang-error-unknown-argument-mno-fused-madd-python-package-installation-fa)
The issue is that clang doesn't like the "shorten-64-to-32" cpp flag. The build crashes when trying to compile libsvm.
//In order to compile I had to do:
//export ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future
//sudo -E python setup.py install
edit: It finished building with the previous fix but it crashes when I use sklearn in a python terminal.
