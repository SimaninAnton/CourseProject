classifier.fit(X1, y1)
classifier.tree_.apply(X2)
crashes silently when X2.shape is not compatible with X1.shape. I was modifying X1 shape programatically and hence did not realise shapes were diverging. So 2 issues:
An error message would be great:
A silent crash is not good (crash = killing the python interpreter), a python Exception would be much better, another chance for an appropriate error message here
