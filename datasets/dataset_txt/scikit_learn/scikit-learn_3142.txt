Since the t-SNE method has local optima and the result depends on initialisation, its FAQ encourages users to run t-SNE multiple times (with the same data) and to pick the best outcome. This can be done by visual inspection, but a user could also do it automatically, if they had access to the numerical cost value.
In the _tsne() function this is the value error and it can be output to screen if verbose, but it is not returned nor stored in an instance variable, so the user can't access it programmatically.
What I'd like to do is something like:
bestmodel = None
for _ in range(3):
    amodel = TSNE()
    amodel.fit(X)
    if bestmodel==None or amodel.error < bestmodel.error:
        bestmodel = amodel

# then use bestmodel
(Noticed this in sklearn 0.17, verified by looking at source code in master)
