Is there a reason for FeatureUnion not having a fit_transform method?
It inherits the one on TransformerMixin that calls fit followed by transform, but transformers with a more efficient fit_transform, like the CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, would benefit from the speedup when used within FeatureUnion.
Maybe there's a reason for this choice that I'm overlooking, but if not, I'll gladly send a pull request.
