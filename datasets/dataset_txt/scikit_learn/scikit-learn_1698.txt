It seems that we can't directly use coordinates (longitude and latitude) to train algorithms such as SVR, and it would be awesome to train machine learning models directly on geographical data.
I saw that there already exist a metric for this ("haversine"), so I was wondering id it would be not too difficult to implement as a kernel ?
Thanks !
