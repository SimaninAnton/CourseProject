just so that you know that 855bc9e
removed support for having standard -a in clean command:
also that commit seems have managed to convert file to CRLF (windows?) format making diffing it problematic (without -b). May be that was all planned -- the please ignore and close it up, I will workaround in the debian package (dh as a standard uses -a for all distutils managed setup.py's)
