When building metrics.pairwise_fast and ensamble._gradient_boosting I got undefined reference to sync_fetch_and_add_4. I used mingw compiler on 64bit pc (windows). To resolve this I added extra_compile_args=["-march=i486"] to config.add_extension of ensamble and metrics's setup.py files. I'm not sure what are the implications on other machines. This stackoverflow answer helped me.
