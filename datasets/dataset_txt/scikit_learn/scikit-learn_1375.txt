Currently scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla will warn to stdout about non-convergence or constraint violations but still return a result. There should be some way to know (via the return) that there was an issue with the solution. In my case, scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla is running as part of a REST service and it's impossible to catch this condition to communicate it back to the user because the only indication is via stdout. Perhaps an option can be added to the call to return None if any issues (constraint violations exceed their max, non-convergence, etc.) occur.
