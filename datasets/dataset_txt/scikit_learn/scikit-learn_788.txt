Description
The X argument in the predict and predict_proba methods is described as "training vectors".
scikit-learn/sklearn/ensemble/voting_classifier.py
Lines 215 to 223 in 7389dba
     def predict(self, X): 
         """ Predict class labels for X. 
            Parameters 
         ---------- 
         X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples, n_features] 
             Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples and 
             n_features is the number of features. 
   scikit-learn/sklearn/ensemble/voting_classifier.py
Lines 259 to 267 in 7389dba
     @property 
     def predict_proba(self): 
         """Compute probabilities of possible outcomes for samples in X. 
            Parameters 
         ---------- 
         X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples, n_features] 
             Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples and 
             n_features is the number of features. 
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Look at the code above.
Expected Results
E.g. same as in
scikit-learn/sklearn/linear_model/base.py
Lines 200 to 207 in 7389dba
     def predict(self, X): 
         """Predict using the linear model 
            Parameters 
         ---------- 
         X : array_like or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features) 
             Samples. 
   Actual Results
Wrong X description.
