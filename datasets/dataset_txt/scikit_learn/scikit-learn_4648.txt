LabelEncoder works incorrectly for unicode labels in Python 2.6 + numpy 1.3. This is currently untested; to reproduce replace bytestrings with unicode strings here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/preprocessing/tests/test_label.py#L191
This is the cause of Jenkins failure that #2462 triggered.
