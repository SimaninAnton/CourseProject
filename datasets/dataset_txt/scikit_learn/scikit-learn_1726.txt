On the SVM documentation page (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
In section 1.4.5, setting C: It says that a "If you have a lot of noisy observations you should decrease it. It corresponds to regularize more the estimation"
But according to the mathematical formulation of C in 1.4.7.1 it appears that increasing C will increase regularization, and will better handle noisy observations.
