Currently the docs say scikit-learn supports "Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3)", but currenlty travis only has python 2.7 / 3.6 builds.
And apparently it is possible to write code that works on both python 2.7 / 3.6, but not on 3.5 (#9908 (comment))
I personally would assume that scikit-learn tests all 'officially' supported python versions, and adding an additional python 3.5 build on travis does not seem that much work / travis build time ?
(at the same time, it could also be discussed if we shouldn't drop official support for python 3.3 (or even python 3.4), but that's maybe for another issue)
