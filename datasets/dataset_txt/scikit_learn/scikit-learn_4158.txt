Hi,
I am trying to use LASSO regression and everything works fine except that while fitting (i.e. after calling the fit(X,y) function) the corresponding process starts using all available cores. So it appears that it runs in parallel. I would prefer that fitting is done using a single core/thread only, but don't see where this can be disabled.
Kind regards,
Alexey
