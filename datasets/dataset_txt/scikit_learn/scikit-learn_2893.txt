Not an issue, but for what it's worth, KNeighborsClassifier is fast on MNIST digits:
KNN          av 97.6  [97.5 97.5 97.7]  train, test: [0 0 0]       [11 11 11] sec
rbf-SVM      av 98.4  [98.4 98.5 98.4]  train, test: [502 503 506] [113 113 113] sec 
poly2-SVM    av 98.4  [98.4 98.5 98.4]  train, test: [275 274 276] [85 84 85] sec 
Random-Forest av 97.0 [96.8 97 97.1]    train, test: [283 284 282] [2 2 2] sec
I don't think MNIST is much of a test case -- very old, dense, no insights --
but it does seem to be common. More test cases ?
