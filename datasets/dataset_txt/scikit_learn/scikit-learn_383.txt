According to GridSearchCV docstring,
best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.
But actually it seems to be always a single estimator if present. In case of multiple scorers, only the score specified by refit parameter is used to fit the best estimator. I think the best_estimator_ type should be changed to estimator only or explained better if I am wrong.
