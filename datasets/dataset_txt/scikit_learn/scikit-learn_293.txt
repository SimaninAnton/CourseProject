Suppose that we have a multi-output classification or regression problem, and we try to solve it
using algorithm chains. Suppose the chosen base algorithm is sensitive to feature
scaling/transformations. Then prior to fitting models in a chain, it is reasonable to
preprocess the data in an appropriate way. Considering the current versions of ClassifierChain
and RegressorChain, all the models, except the first, learn and predict on the new data
augmented by untransformed labels and (cross-validated) predictions respectively.
But if we decide to preprocess the data in some way and then fit/predict, isn't it convenient to
postprocess the labels/predictions correspondingly before stacking them into the data for the
following models (at least, to have an option to do so)? Of course, the predictions made by the
chain should be in original form. Any thoughts on this?
