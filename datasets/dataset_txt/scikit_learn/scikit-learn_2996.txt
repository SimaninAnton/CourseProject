Plotting confusion matrices is a pretty common thing, and having a useful example that you can copy and paste would be cool.
We have this one but I think it could be improved in two ways:
make the class names a parameter of the function
plot the actual numbers inside the matrix
something like
    thresh = cm.max() / 2.
    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):
        plt.text(j, i, cm[i, j], horizontalalignment="center", color="white" if cm[i, j] > thresh else "black")
