This is as much of a feature request as anything. In our science applications we often deal with datasets that have been masked for some reason (e.g. some observational limitation resulting in a selection function). It would be nice if the mixture.GMM could properly estimate the Gaussian model in the case of missing data. It is not clear whether mixture.GMM is capable of having a Gaussian component with a mean outside the extent of the data.
As you can see from this jupyter notebook sickout-learn's GMM function appears to be incapable of correctly fitting datasets with missing data. Even when it is just one Gaussian component and the number of data points is large.
