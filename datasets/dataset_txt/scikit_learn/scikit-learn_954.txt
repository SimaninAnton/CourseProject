Sorry that I'm asking this question here. I couldn't find an answer by searching online. I also looked at the code but could not find out whether the fit() function in gpr.py eventually does its operations in parallel or not, although it looks like that it does not. I personally do not notice any performance improvements when using GaussianProcessRegressor on a machine which has 8 cores (16 threads) or a machine which has 4 cores (8 threads). So I wonder, can someone confirm whether or not the GaussianProcessRegressor take the advantage of multiple cores/threads?
