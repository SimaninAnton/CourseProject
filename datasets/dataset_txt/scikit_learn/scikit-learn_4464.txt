Hi,
Using Pipeline and FeatureUnion one can combine multiple estimators into a single object and do a joint parameter selection. But they didn't help with a joint model selection if you want to use a different estimator class at some step (e.g. select a different classifier) or disable some step entirely (e.g. exclude some features).
What do you think about adding "Alternatives" or "Switch" or "EstimatorSelector" or "Selector" meta-estimator that will allow choose between estimators using its set_params?
fu = FeatureUnion([
    ('pca', Selector([
        ('linear', PCA()), 
        ('kernel', KernelPCA()),
        ('disabled', None),  # or something like ('disabled', NoFeatures()),
    ], estimator='linear')),
    ('truncated_svd', TruncatedSVD()),
])
Then you can use fu.set_params(pca__estimator='kernel', pca__kernel__n_components=10) or fu.set_params(pca__estimator='disabled'). We may also support fu.set_params(pca__estimator=None) directly without a need to define 'disabled' option.
