Triggered by this SO question: GradientBoostingClassifier's docstring states that loss may be "ls", in which case least squares regression will be performed, but when you only try to do that, a ValueError is raised. I'm not sure if the code or the docs should be changed.
(I also noticed that Huber and quantile loss are not advertised in the regressor's docstring.)
