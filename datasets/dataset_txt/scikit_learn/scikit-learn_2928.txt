I am using Bayes Ridge regression library (sklearn.linear_model.BayesianRidge). My model includes several features and I want to estimate the precision of each of the weights. The attribute that I have to use is lambda_
However, when I call lambda_, I only obtain one value, not an array of size the number of feature. How can I solve this issue?
Thank you!
