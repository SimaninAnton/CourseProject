The handling of deprecated constructor parameters is leveraging the execution Python warnings machinery which is not thread-safe and could therefore caused hard to diagnose bugs in
There was a tentative lock-based workaround in #2729. A better solution however would avoid executing the warning machinery at all in get_params by leveraging declarative deprecation introspection possibly using a class decorator.
I will try to issue a PR for this next week.
