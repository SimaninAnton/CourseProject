As title, how do I find issues that no one is working on?
I'd like to contribute to issues that no one is working on.
I spent much time browsing open issues to find them.
My best approach is: Find open issues with least comments. However, it also failed in some cases like #1854 (at this point, it is open without comment, but someone is working on it with a pull request to it). Is there any better approach? Probably with convention of issue title, assignee, or label?
Sorry if it is a stupid question......I'm a new contributor.
