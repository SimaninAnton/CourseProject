Since Scikit-learn could prove very useful in research, I kindly suggest for adding a 'seed' parameter for reproducible work. For example, if someone runs RandomForests, rather getting different results each time it is ran, if "seed" is fixed to 1, it should always yield the same results. This would greatly help in verifying experimental results of authors who publish papers using scikit :)
