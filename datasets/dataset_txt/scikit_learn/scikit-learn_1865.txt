I would like to know how to divide my data set in to two particular parts as set of features and target just like the Iris data set, so that i can proceed with the data modelling. Im supposed to be using the K nearest neighbor algorithm and therefore I need the data to be divided into two set using pandas library.I use the sci kit learn toolset
