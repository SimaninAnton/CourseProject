Currently, fetch_rcv1 uses the vectorized version of the RCV1 dataset and returns the sparse matrix with the document-term frequencies together with target_id, target_names and sample_id.
The vocabulary, mapping 47236 numeric features to stemmed words, is missing in the returned object. For interpretability of results, it would be helpful to add it.
It might be sufficient to just take mapping from the stem.termid.idf.map.txt file from the B.14. On-Line Appendix 14.
If this doesn't work, another approach could be to re-vectorize the initial tokenized version of the dataset (lyrl2004_tokens_test_pt*.dat files available under section "B.12.i. RCV1-v2 Token Files" here ) and try to match the results with the provided vectorized version. A parser for the tokenized files format is available in this function.
This might require some reverse engineering unless @daviddlewis can suggest which approach should be used.
