sklearn provides an implementation of the Munkres (Hungarian) algorithm in sklearn.utils.linear_assignment_ which turns out to be very efficient: on moderate size problems (n=20), it is ~5 times faster than the original (B. Clapper) implementation and ~15 times faster than the networkx implementation (which I guess would be the first place most people would look for an implementation).
I understand it isn't really in sklearn's scope but it'd be nice to publicize this a bit more in the docs, I accidentally stumbled upon it and it was quite helpful.
