Hi,
python 2.7.13
virtual environment.
Windows 7
I have nothing done with PATH etc. I activate the environment and did
pip install -U scikit-learn
Now I have a folder sklearn in site-package. But there are missing modules like
dist_metrics.pxd
I Only have the executable dist_metrics without the script...
Also: If I do pip list
there is no sklearn package listed. Only the sci-kit learn package. But how do I get the sklearn package?
