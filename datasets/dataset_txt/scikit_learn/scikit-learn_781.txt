The functions _multinomial_loss, _multinomial_loss_grad, _multinomial_grad_hess in sklearn.linear_model.logistic take an argument sample_weight which has the following documentation:
sample_weight : array-like, shape (n_samples,) optional
        Array of weights that are assigned to individual samples.
However, unlike in the functions _logistic_loss_and_grad, _logistic_loss, _logistic_grad_hess, this argument is not optional as the documentation says, and passing None or an empty array to it will throw an error.
