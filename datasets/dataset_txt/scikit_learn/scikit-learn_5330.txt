The function sorts the thresholds from low values to high values
thresholds = np.unique(y_score)
However, the matrix
sorted_signal = signal[signal[:, 0].argsort(), :][::-1]
is sorted in the reverse order and used to calculate the fpr and tpr.
when the function returns tpr, fpr and thresholds the connection between the threshold array and the fpr and tpr is lost.
