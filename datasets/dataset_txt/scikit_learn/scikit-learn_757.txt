Description
I think there is an error in the example of the class ExampleEstimator in line 879.
In the fit method it says k instead of self.k. If that's the case, I can fix it.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Doesn't apply.
Expected Results
class ExampleEstimator(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, n_clusters=8, k='not_used'):
        self.n_clusters = n_clusters
        self.k = k

    def fit(self, X, y):
        if self.k != 'not_used':
            warnings.warn("'k' was renamed to n_clusters in version 0.13 and "
                          "will be removed in 0.15.", DeprecationWarning)
            self._n_clusters = self.k
        else:
            self._n_clusters = self.n_clusters
Actual Results
class ExampleEstimator(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, n_clusters=8, k='not_used'):
        self.n_clusters = n_clusters
        self.k = k

    def fit(self, X, y):
        if k != 'not_used':
            warnings.warn("'k' was renamed to n_clusters in version 0.13 and "
                          "will be removed in 0.15.", DeprecationWarning)
            self._n_clusters = k
        else:
            self._n_clusters = self.n_clusters
