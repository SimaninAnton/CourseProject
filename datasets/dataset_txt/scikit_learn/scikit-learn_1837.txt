Description
As suggested by @jnothman in #9737 (comment), using an inverted index in trustworthiness could replace a O(n_samples^2 * n_neighbors) computation by a O(n_samples^2 + n_samples * n_neighbors) computation. Indeed, it would allow to lookup the rank of neighbors in the original space instead of using np.where for each neighbor.
