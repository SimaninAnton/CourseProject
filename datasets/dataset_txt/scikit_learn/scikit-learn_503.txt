In _find_best_bin_to_split_helper(), it'd be more efficient to only compute the (negative) loss of the parent once, instead of at each bin.
In other terms, we should compute
negative_loss(sum_gradients, sum_hessians, l2_regularization)
before the for loop.

I don't expect this to be a terrific improvement though.
Marking this easy, but I would not recommend as a first issue since it involves cython.
