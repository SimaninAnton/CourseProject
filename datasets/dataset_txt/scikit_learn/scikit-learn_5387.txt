Minibatch k-means crashes when used with the default arguments and more than 300 clusters.
The reason is that the default init_size for kmeans++ initialization is 3 * batchsize and the default
batchsize is 100.
So the default init_size is smaller than k.
I don't know what a sensible setting of init_size is with "many" clusters.
In general I would guess that having a batch_size smaller than the number of clusters should be ok.
