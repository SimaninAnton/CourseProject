I'm using lightgbm 2.2.2 with RandomizedSearchCV in sklearn v 0.20.1. MacOS Mojave.
raceback (most recent call last):
  File "gbm.py", line 1339, in <module>
    scoring=score_methods, refit='nll')
  File "gbm.py", line 1264, in param_search_lgb
    rs.fit(X_train, y_train)
  File "/Users/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py", line 722, in fit
    self._run_search(evaluate_candidates)
  File "/Users//anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py", line 1515, in _run_search
    random_state=self.random_state))
  File "/Users/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py", line 719, in evaluate_candidates
    all_candidate_params, scorers, n_splits, all_out)
  File "/Users/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py", line 763, in _format_results
    score_time) = zip(*out)
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 0)
The issue traces to these two lines below, with return_train_score=True
scikit-learn/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py
Line 760 in 55bf5d9
 score_time) = zip(*out) 
Setting return_train_score=False did not work, still hitting the same issue.
scikit-learn/sklearn/model_selection/_search.py
Line 763 in 55bf5d9
 score_time) = zip(*out) 
From the trackback, I suspect that the line below could be returning None. This doesn't always happen, but only sometimes. My param search was able to run for a few rounds, and then hit this issue.

The problem could be that lightgbm did not return valid results (have not verified), but either way, this error could be handled better.
Does anyone have more insight into the potential cause?
Thanks.
