Maybe we should list all the experimental features, at least in maintainer.rst?
e.g., previously I though that ColumnTransformer was the only experimental feature which was not included in sklearn.experimental (now it's not an experimental feature), but recently I realized that fetch_openml is also experimental (maybe I'm still missing something?).
