See Circle log:
/home/circleci/project/doc/modules/dp-derivation.rst: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
dp-derivation.rst is not included in user guide and relevant function will be removed in 0.20. Maybe we need to modify the file with latest api and integrate it into current user guide (or simply remove it?).
