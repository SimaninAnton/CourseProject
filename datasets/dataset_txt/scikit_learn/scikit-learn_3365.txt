The whole cross validation / parameter search relies on sample masks rather than train / test physical datasets. This is not convenient if we need for example to remove some features /sample from a sparse dataset to evaluate reconstruction. More flexibility would be possible if we were able to provide an iterator of (X_train, X_test) to GridSearchCV / cross_val_score.
