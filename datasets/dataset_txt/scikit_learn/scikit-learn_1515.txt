Description
I have cloned the scikit-learn package and I would like to build it. I follow the steps in http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html. When trying to install the MS Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4, I have this error message
. However, .Net Framework 4.7 is already installed.

If I skip the error message, windows SDK does not allow me to install Visual C++ compilers !!

How can I proceed please? Any ideas?
