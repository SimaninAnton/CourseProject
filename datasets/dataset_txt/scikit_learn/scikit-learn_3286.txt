I'm interested in using the RANSAC regressor when the base estimator has weights (e.g., I'd like to use the sample_weight keyword with LinearRegression.fit()). I can't figure out how to pass the sample_weights through RANSAC to the base estimator. Am I overlooking something, or is this a missing feature?
