The x-axis and y-axis for precision_recall_curve and roc_curve are reversed, which I find confusing / bothering.
For roc_curve:
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_score)
pl.plot(fpr, tpr)
For precision_recall_curve:
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_score)
pl.plot(recall, precision)
Not sure if there's anything we can do about it without breaking the API.
