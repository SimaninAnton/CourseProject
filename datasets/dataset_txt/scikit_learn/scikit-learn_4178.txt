I'm running into some memory issues with the linear_model.Ridge class. In short, when fitting Ridge with the 'lsqr' or 'sparse_cg' solver, I'm getting large memory increases when doing the fitting in a loop (e.g., in cross-validation). The peak memory used is roughly linear with the number of repetitions in the loop.
Here's a quick gist to show what I'm talking about.
