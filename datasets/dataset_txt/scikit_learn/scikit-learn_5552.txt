I'm not sure it is normal or not. Just I hope to check.
svmfitted=LinearSVC(loss='l2', penalty="l1", C=1000,dual=False, tol=1e-3).fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = svmfitted.predict(X_test)
print 1.0*sum(pred)/len(pred)
knnfitted=KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=10).fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = knnfitted.predict(X_test)
print 1.0*sum(pred)/len(pred)
When I using above code, I have different result from same input data.
Am I wrong something? or is it normal?
X_test variable has only one category for easy computation. But training data have two categories.
