While you want to compute recall-precision for sklearn classifiers you cannot use general pipeline containing preprocessing.label_binarize (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html) because it crash on case of just 2 classes, even it is documented it should not happen especially you do not know apriory number of classes.
