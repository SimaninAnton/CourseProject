I think we should change the default gamma in SVC to None, instead of 0.
0 will be replaced by a data-dependent default, which is 1. / n_features.
This seems very non-idiomatic. Usually we use None for "this parameter is not provided".
We can just change the default value and deprecate setting it 0, but I doubt that many people will even see the deprecation warning (it would mean they explicitly passed the default parameter).
