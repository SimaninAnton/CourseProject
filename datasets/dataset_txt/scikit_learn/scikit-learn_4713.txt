As evidenced by #2318, the doctest runner of sklearn.test() does not include the function that carry the docstring's doctest its doctest namespace while it is the case when we run the doctests with nosetests sklearn
If we can find a way to fix that, we will be able to setup continuous integration for installed packages to automatically test the packaging of the future releases.
