I tried to use StandardScaler, the documentation is hard to understand
For a new user, The only thing I want to know is how to use it. What the input should looks like and what the result I can get.
In the example, you just gave some code without any necessary explaination.
"">>> print(scaler.mean_)
[ 0.5 0.5]
"""
why is 0.5 instead of 0? You are normalizing it why it is 0.5?
data = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
So what's the data meaning? Does [0, 0] is a datapoint or what?
Are all the first element in the list is the same feature?
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
data = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
scaler = StandardScaler()
print(scaler.fit(data))
StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True)
print(scaler.mean_)
[ 0.5 0.5]
print(scaler.transform(data))
[[-1. -1.]
[-1. -1.]
[ 1. 1.]
[ 1. 1.]]
print(scaler.transform([[2, 2]]))
[[ 3. 3.]]
Same thing for many other docuemtations for scikitlearn. Really need explaination for examples
