I want to cluster records of data that are not in float matrix form and also there isn't any feature vector for each record. Hopefully DBSCAN clustering algorithm can use callable similarity function but:
model = DBSCAN(metric=mysimilarityfunc)
model.fit(data)
tries to convert whole matrix into float type and rises this error:
ValueError: could not convert string to float
Is there any solution for this problem?
