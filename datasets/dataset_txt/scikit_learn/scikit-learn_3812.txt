There is no validation of max_iter and tol in LogisticRegression
Ex: If a string is passed, it will act as infinity:
LogisticRegression(tol=0.01, solver="newton-cg",max_iter="100") will have no maximum iteration
LogisticRegression(tol="0.01", solver="newton-cg",max_iter=100) will return zeros for stopping before first iteration
