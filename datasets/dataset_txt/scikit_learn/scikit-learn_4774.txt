I am trying to run your 20newsgroups code on my own data with a single class
it bugs because in the ONE CLASS CASE all classifiers use coeff_.shape=(1,nfeatures) except multinomialNB and bernoullinb which have coef_.shape=(nfeatures,)
if hasattr(clf, 'coef_'):
print "dimensionality: %d" % clf.coef_.shape[1]
infact:naive bayes line 265
XXX The following is a stopgap measure; we need to set the dimensions
# of class_log_prior_ and feature_log_prob_ correctly.
def _get_coef(self):
    return (self.feature_log_prob_[1]
            if len(self.classes_) == 2 else self.feature_log_prob_)
