I'm running into a problem with SGDRegressor where it's giving me "ValueError: floating-point under-/overflow occured." on a sparse matrix I need to fit.
I read on another issue that the solution to this is to scale the feature matrix. I am already doing that using StandardScaler. with_mean is set to False because of the sparse matrix, all other parameters are left on default values. However I still get the overflow error.
Does SGDRegressor expect the feature matrix to be centred? This is not very clear from the docs.
