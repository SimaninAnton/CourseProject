As also reported in #11954, the OPTICS docstring for metric includes values which are not supported, and also is missing values which are already supported.
The docstring needs to actually include the supported ones, and since the metric is used calling two different modules, OPTICS should probably check if the given value is in the intersection of their supported ones.
