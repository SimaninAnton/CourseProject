Hello I'm sorry but I have to reopen this:
Here is a simple test, I launch a time.sleep and while it's sleeping i press Ctrl C.
The issue (as you can see below) happens on sklearn, not other packages
(PS I can reproduce it everytime)
I also have found this issue in scipy.stats BTW.
I also found this issue on it here,
but I cannot apply the solution to this case because I cannot load manually the libifcoremd.dll (I don't find it in my environment packages, only the PYD)
I have tried to reset the signal handler to the default value with signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_DFL)
without any success.
problem may be related to fortran https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-visual-fortran-compiler-for-windows/topic/518251
If someone could help me to adapt the solution mentioned to this case.
Thank you in advance
PS this was seen in #9431 before but closed
