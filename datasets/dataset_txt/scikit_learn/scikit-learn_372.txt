there is no explanations in user manual

how different dual vs primal
The ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, and ‘lbfgs’ solvers support only L2 regularization with primal formulation, or no regularization. The ‘liblinear’ solver supports both L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty. The Elastic-Net regularization is only supported by the ‘saga’ solver.
it would be great explain what performance/ algorithm difference
my guess you did something great, but people can not use is ...
