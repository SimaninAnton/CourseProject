We've reached consensus that the old list is problematic and should be deprecated, so we need to introduce a new one.

I think this is a problematic stop list for two main reasons (presence of words like "system" and inconsistency with our tokenizer). I think we should remove it, but we should recommend that users load a stop list from elsewhere with caution. We could consider replacing it with a short and less controversial list like https://github.com/igorbrigadir/stopwords/blob/master/en/bow_short.txt, perhaps adding contracted ve and ll.
I'd rather a more minimalistic list. In the context of machine learning,
it's more important that we leave words in which may be informative than
that we remove words which may possibly be noisy.

The Bow stop list has 48 words, while the Glasgow IR one contains 318. That's more than just removing the debatable words like "system". I you find that the one in Spacy is unsutable what about the one e.g. NLTK or some other active OSS project? Generally, maybe this discussion could happen in a separate issue?
Borrowing an existing list (or even use current list) and solve the problems we've found in the paper seems fine from my side.
