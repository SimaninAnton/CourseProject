Here is the error of course: "fit() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)"
I am not sure what the best approach is, a very simple patch could calculate self.means_ and assume init_params='wc' when fit(X,y=None) is called with non-None y, it is also possible to have a _fiit(X) and factor the code.
If this is the right path (and GMM with fit(X,y) is something you think is useful) please let me know to submit a patch, otherwise I appreciate if you let me know the best approach
