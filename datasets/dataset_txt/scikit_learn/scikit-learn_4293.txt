For the Logistic Regression model that uses the liblinear solver, (that uses a tron solver as a backend), the max iter is hardcoded to 1000, with the max iter parameter remaining unpassed from sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression. This does not help to bench for a lower tolerance (in the case of which the tol parameter becomes invalid, since it is going to run for 1000 iterations anyway) , and for some datasets that require more than 1000 iterations to converge.
Also it does not print out the adequate (non) convergence warnings.
