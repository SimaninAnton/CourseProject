gradient_boosting VerboseReporter is reporting wrong remaining time when warm_start == True.
To reproduce the issue, fit some trees, then set warm_start = True and fit more. The remaing time will be wrongly updated.
I believe the problem lie in this line:
remaining_time = ((est.n_estimators - (i + 1)) *
(time() - self.start_time) / float(i + 1))
The correct code should be:
remaining_time = ((est.n_estimators - (j + 1)) *
(time() - self.start_time) / float(i + 1))
The diference is in est.n_estimators - (j + 1)), it should use "j" and not "i" here.
