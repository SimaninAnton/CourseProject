The following minimal example doesn't fail:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
l = list(range(100))
train_test_split(l, test_size=-2)
train_test_split(l, test_size=-2.)
Is it a bug or indented feature? According to the docs neither of the above should make sense. See for reference this line for example.
