Not sure if this is properly filed with scikit-learn or pip, but this is what I found. I assumed that pip would install all necessary dependencies upon running
pip install scikit-learn
However, pip did not install scipy. This lead to a traceback with a very vague error message from the file sklearn/init.py,
ImportError: cannot import name __check_build
It seems reasonable that scikit-learn would instead alert the user to the fact that there is a missing dependency, and is not actually installed incorrectly.
