Hi,
I don't know if this should go in issue but I think that we should update the documentation concerning the cross_val_predict function
Currently we can read :
    It is not appropriate to pass these predictions into an evaluation
    metric. Use :func:`cross_validate` to measure generalization error.
I think that in the context of a pooling computation of performance, it can be used to estimate the performances of the model (compare to the cross_validate function which uses an average computation of performances).
For instance, in the context of a one leave out, there is no other choice than pooling the outputs of the models to estimate the performances
