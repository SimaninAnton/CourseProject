Currently, TfidfTransformer does document length normalization before IDF reweighting. I think this should be the other way round.
Furthermore, the documentation of the text module is not up to date - it still refers to the dense / sparse versions.
I'd also suggest that TfidfTransformer and Vectorizer take an additional argument norm to specifiy L1 or L2 length normalization (we could also use length_norm = 'l1' | 'l2' | None instead of use_tf which is tricky anyways: it could also refer to using term frequencies instead of term incidence (binary) rather than normalize term frequencies.
