Hi,
I'm using a RandomForestClassifier with n_jobs =-1. I have also tried values != 1 with the same effect.
The problem is that python process gets replicated infinitely until the OS crashes. There are no loops in my code which reads like this:
init the RandomForest
Load the data
Prepare the data
predictor.fit_transform(X,y)
print some predictor parameters
It seems that all the processes start from very beginning and when they reach the 4th step...they replicate again. I end up soon having tens of processes running over and over again. 5th step never gets executed.
When I have set the n_jobs =1 everything works fine.
I'm running Win 7 x64, Python 2.7.2 32bit with scikit 0.10
