Description
this is for an assignment for a CS class
There is a potential issue for new open source contributors looking to contribute to this project. In the readme for the project, information about making a contribution is linked under the header titled: "Setting up a development environment." My suggestion for a fix that would help a new user to the project would be to either re-title that as "Contribution Information" or "Setting up a development environment/how to contribute." I think this would greatly increase the speed for a new user to locate the information.
