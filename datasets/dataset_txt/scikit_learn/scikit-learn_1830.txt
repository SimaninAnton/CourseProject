They should be included in sklearn/metrics/tests/test_common.py but are not.
Note that adding ndcg_score to common tests may not be sufficient: think it differs from existing metrics in that it is multiclass with scores per class. This may entail the modification of common tests.
The implementation should build upon #9928 (or wait until it is merged).
