As we don't want to enforce inheritance from sklearn estimators, and even say so in the docs, we should actually test for that.
We currently test only GridSearchCV [here]https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/tests/test_grid_search.py#L128). We should also test cross_val_score, Pipeline, RFE and RFECV I think.
For cross_val_score that is only a matter of not making the MockEstimator inherit from BaseEstimator I think.
