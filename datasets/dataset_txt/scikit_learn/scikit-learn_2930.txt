Is there a particular reason why classes such as PCA, TruncatedPCA do not store the singular values as instance variables after they have been computed? It would seem useful to store them since they are already computed so that they can be later accessed if need be. One use case would be to scale the right singular vectors by their singular values. I am happy to make the changes and push if there are no objections.
