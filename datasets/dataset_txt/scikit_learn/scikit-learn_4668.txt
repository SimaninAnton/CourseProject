I recently installed scikit-learn with pip install scikit-learn (version 0.14.1).
Trying to run the tests with nosetests --exe sklearn -v the above mentioned test never seems to finish. Excluding the test with -e test_fit_transform all other tests seem to pass.
Environment is set-up according to http://joernhees.de/blog/2013/06/08/mac-os-x-10-8-scientific-python-with-homebrew/
