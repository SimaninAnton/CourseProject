1 The regressor of interest and the data are orthogonalized wrt constant regressors.
2. The cross correlation between data and regressors is computed.
The cross correlation by definition involves orthogonalizing wrt a constant regressor. i.e
((X - mean_X) * (Y - mean_Y) / (std(X) * std(Y)), which I think makes the first step redundant.
