Hello,
I often have problems with the '_safe_split' function that is either non recognized or not imported by some of the functions I use. I am usually able to manage that manually but this time, I had no clue to how to deal with this:
I called function GridSearchCV and here is the exception I have:
Description
Code
pipeline = Pipeline([
('vect', CountVectorizer()),
('tfidf', TfidfTransformer(smooth_idf = True)),
('clf', SGDClassifier())
])
parameters = {
'vect__max_features' : (None, 5000, 10000)
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, parameters, n_jobs = -1, verbose = 1)
grid_search.fit(X, Y)
Results
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/nlp/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/_parallel_backends.py", line 344, in call

NameError: name '_safe_split' is not defined
Remarks
I have tried to import manually the function by copy pasting it in validation.py. But it still doesn't recognize it.
Any clue how to solve this? Every time I use a function in scikit-learn, I got a problem with _safe_split function even though I have removed the package with both pip and conda , and reinstalled the latest version : 0.18.01
