When I do make html I get tons of warning like:
/Users/nmayorov/PythonDev/scikit-learn/doc/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
As the result most of API sections are empty, i. e. no listed classes or functions. Few of the sections are built correctly.
I suspect it might have something to do with update to OS X El Capitan.
Can you suggest something to fix it?
