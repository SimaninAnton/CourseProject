Dear all,
First, thanks for the wonderful work!
When I read the documentation ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering ) about agglomerative clustering using the affinity : "precomputed", it is not written if the matrix provided is supposed to be a distance matrix or a similarity matrix (which are "inverses").
After some reads and tries I believe the matrix given behave as a distance matrix.
I think that It would be suitable to add this information: for example, this:
affinity : string or callable, default: “euclidean”
Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be “euclidean”, “l1”, “l2”, “manhattan”, “cosine”, or ‘precomputed’. If linkage is “ward”, only “euclidean” is accepted. If 'precomputed' a distance matrix is needed as input for the fit method.
instead of this:
affinity : string or callable, default: “euclidean”
Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be “euclidean”, “l1”, “l2”, “manhattan”, “cosine”, or ‘precomputed’. If linkage is “ward”, only “euclidean” is accepted.
Best regards and thanks for your wonderful work! =)
