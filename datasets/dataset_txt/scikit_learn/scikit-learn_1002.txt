PR #10325 make it possible to derive a new criterion by exposing the RegressionCriterion and ClassificationCriterion. However, it seems that this PR does not make available the header file _criterion.pxd in the wheel. I was thinking that MANIFEST.in who do that but apparently not.
Checking scipy, I think that we should add the following sklearn/tree/setup.py
config.add_data_files('_criterion.pxd')
Is it the right way and do we want to do it?
