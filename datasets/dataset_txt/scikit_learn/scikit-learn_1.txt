Currently, sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer accepts custom analyzer, but there is no way to pass input to analyzer!
Describe the workflow you want to enable
I would like to add an optional input to CountVectorizer that contains arguments for analyzer custom method
Describe your proposed solution
Passing the added input (possibly array of arguments) to _analyze method, it is possible to call the analyzer custom method with arguments. Am I right? Possibly, _validate_custom_analyzer should also be modified accordingly.
Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Additional context
Please let me know if I am wrong and there is already a way to call analyzer with user input.
