Assuming the next 0.21 release happens around or after April 2019, the oldest Ubuntu LTS at that point will be 16.04 LTS, which includes,
numpy 1.11.0
scipy 0.17.0
(checked in a Docker image, not sure where to find the official information)
so we could probably make these our minimum requirements for 0.21.
Making so would for instance allow to implement #11638
Even assuming there is agreement on this subject, we should probably wait for 0.20.1, at least, before doing anything about it. Eventually this would involve,
adjusting versions of dependencies in docs and CI
removing the utils.fixes that are no longer needed.
