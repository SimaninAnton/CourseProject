Supervised clustering metrics (at least where there is a fixed set of samples, unlike in coreference resolution with system mentions) can usually be calculated from the contingency matrix alone. I think passing y_true=contingency, y_pred=None should trigger this behaviour, saving computational time when calculating multiple measures.
