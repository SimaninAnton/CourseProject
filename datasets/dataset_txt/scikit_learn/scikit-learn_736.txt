Right now LabelKFold has no option for setting the random seed. It's parent class has this option; however, the init call of LabelKFold does not allow the user to set this option. Instead the random state is always set to None. From _split.py:
class LabelKFold(_BaseKFold):
    def __init__(self, n_folds=3):
        super(LabelKFold, self).__init__(n_folds, shuffle=False,
                                         random_state=None)
It should be a simple change to allow instances of LabelKFold to have specific random seeds.
