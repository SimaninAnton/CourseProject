In #7477 a solution was proposed that did something like
class Estimator(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, param=None):
        self._param = param

    @property
    def param(self):
        return some_stuff(self._param)
The common tests let this pass, though that should wreck havoc on get_params and set_params.
I haven't looked into it but I think the tests should fail on this.
