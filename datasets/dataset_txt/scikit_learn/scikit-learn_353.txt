Description
In the dev docs I found a pair of inconsistencies.
First there's a note saying that it only works for binary multilabel, but recently multiclass support has been added.
Then, in the multiclass param there's a visual bug:
I don't quite understand this last one because the code looks correct
scikit-learn/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py
Line 303 in a83c831
         ``'ovr'``: 
Edit: Ok so we need a newline above and that would be solved.
I also have a question, now we can get the roc_auc for multiclass but there is nothing about multiclass in the roc_curve section, however we need the curves in order to get the auc, or not?
