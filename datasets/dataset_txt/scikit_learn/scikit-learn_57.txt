Hello,
I found two code snippets in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e85a6d1f/sklearn/datasets/_samples_generator.py are susceptible to infinite loop iterations when using make_multilabel_classification():
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e85a6d1f/sklearn/datasets/_samples_generator.py#L357
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e85a6d1f/sklearn/datasets/_samples_generator.py#L371
These happen when the parameters of make_multilabel_classification functions are EITHER (allowed_unlabeled = False and n_classes = 0) OR length = 0.
I am using the version 0.20.3 of scikit-learn.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
Thank You
