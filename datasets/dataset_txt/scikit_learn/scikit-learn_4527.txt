In Scikit-Learn's official tutorial page on Unsupervised Learning (http://scikit-learn.org/0.11/tutorial/statistical_inference/unsupervised_learning.html), Section 2. 2.4.1.2.1 (connectivity-constrained clustering) uses grid_to_graph, but doesn't say where it was imported from (sklearn.feature_extraction_image).
