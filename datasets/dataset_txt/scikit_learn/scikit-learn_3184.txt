As mentioned in #6354 : the cythonize.py file is really a script, and thus should probably not be in the sklearn directory. It would benefit from a directory of its own.
I propose that we rename the directory "continuous_integration" to "build_tools", maybe rename the various ".sh" files in there to prepend the names with "ci_", as in "ci_push_doc.sh", and move the cythonize.py file in there.
What do people think?
