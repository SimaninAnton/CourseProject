_parallel_build_estimators() from sklearn.ensemble.bagging should take max_features as an argument, similar to how it receives max_samples.
Currently it uses whatever value the ensemble estimator it receives was initialized with, which could be a float. This will cause problems when using max_features to randomly subsample the features, as an int is expected.
For instance, BaseBagging._fit() correctly converts the float to an int (if necessary), but then does nothing with the converted value. It should pass the converted value to _parallel_build_estimators().
