Just two things I just saw on the website: the "Documentation" button in the menu not vertically aligned with the others in Firefox. I don't think that was the case before.
Also, the developer documentation is basically unreachable.
I think after the redesign it was on the development page. I don't know why it was changed, but [edit]: it has been like that since the redesign :-/ [/edit] currently the only way to find it is to scroll to the bottom of the user guide. That is clearly suboptimal.
