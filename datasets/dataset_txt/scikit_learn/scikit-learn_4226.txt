When doing builds on the ipython/scipystack image on the Docker hub, noticed that scikit-learn builds were failing.
Downloading/unpacking scikit-learn 
Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip_build_root/scikit-learn/setup.py) egg_info for package scikit-learn 
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: No module named wheelhouse_uploader.cmd 
Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:

    import wheelhouse_uploader.cmd

ImportError: No module named wheelhouse_uploader.cmd
This is probably more of an issue of importing wheelhouse_uploader during installs rather than with CI.
