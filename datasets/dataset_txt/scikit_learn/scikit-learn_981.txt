Description
sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors has n_neighbors arg for the constructor, which according to the docs should accept only int as a value. Unfortunately, the following code runs without raising an error and fails only when calling .fit
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
n = NearestNeigbors(np.random.randn(3, 5)) # This runs without an issue
n.fit(np.random.randn(10, 5)) # this fails
Expected Results
No error is thrown, should raise a TypeError
Actual Results
Works withour raising errors or warnings
