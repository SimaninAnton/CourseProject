The adjusted rand score for clustering returns a division by zero error when there are as many clusters as documents both in the prediction and the target (in which case the score should return 1.0).
This code reproduces the error:
from sklearn import metrics
metrics.adjusted_rand_score([0,1,2],[0,1,2])
This is probably a very simple bug that can be easily fixed?
