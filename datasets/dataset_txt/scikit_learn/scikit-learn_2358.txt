Scikit_learn seems to be shipping a joblib distribution, which causes the usual overhead and confusion associated with bundling. Gentoo - for instance - has been editing the sources of scikit_learn to remove all imports of scikit_learn's joblib and instead import the system joblib for a long time now, and the software runs and passes tests successfully.
If scikits_learn may need a specific joblib version at some point, that can be more appropriately handled by restricting the dependency via a minimum or maximum version.
As part of brainhack2017 in Zurich I would be happy to help by either (in my order of preference):
removing the shipped joblib and its associated code entirely,
preferentially importing the system joblib, and adding except statements that default to the bundled joblib import,
preferentially importing the bundled joblib, and adding an except statement defaulting to the system joblib. This latter suggestion simply makes it easier to maintain unbundled distributions of scikit_learn - by only having to not install sklearn/externals/joblib.
Could you please let me know what contribution addressing this issue would be best received?
