Hi,
I tried to use sklearn.feature_selection.rfe.RFECV with linear_model.LinearRegression as an estimator and it doesn't work because the shape of the coef_ attribute is 1D (n,) when it should be (1,n).
From the documentation for RFECV, it says "The first dimension of the coef_ array must be equal to the number of features of the input dataset of the estimator."
When I use svm.SVR as the estimator, RFECV works, and coef_.shape = (1,n) so I think the shape of linear_model.LinearRegression.coef_ just needs to be changed
