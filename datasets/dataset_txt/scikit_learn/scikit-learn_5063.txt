Hello!
Here's an error I've caught:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/feature_extraction/dict_vectorizer.py", line 123, in fit_transform
return self.transform(X)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/feature_extraction/dict_vectorizer.py", line 206, in transform
shape = (i + 1, len(vocab))
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment
I've tried the latest scikit-learn versions from PIP and Ubuntu repo, and both have this problem.
