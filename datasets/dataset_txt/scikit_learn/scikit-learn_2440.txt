Description
Currently, score() method returns the mean accuracy
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/base.py#L324
which is different from the scoring function supplied by user in constructor:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py#L1500
This is confusing, because as a user I would expect score() to use the same scoring function specified.
