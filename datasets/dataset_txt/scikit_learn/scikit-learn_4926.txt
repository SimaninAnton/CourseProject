from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem
trans = Nystroem(kernel='linear')
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[0,1],[1,0]])
trans.fit(x)
trans.transform(x)
TypeError: linear_kernel() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gamma'
I'm not sure how you guys would want to fix it. The offending code in /sklearn/kernel_approximation.py
else:
    params = {"gamma": self.gamma,
                    "degree": self.degree,
                    "coef0": self.coef0}
    basis_kernel = pairwise_kernels(basis, metric=self.kernel,
                                        filter_params=True, **params)
I'd be happy to submit a pull request and unit tests for the bug if I get some hints how you guys would want this fixed.
