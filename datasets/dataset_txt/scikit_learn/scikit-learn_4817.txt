I assume this parameter should be sample_weight, not weight for consistency with other estimators. (weight will need to be deprecated but available for two versions as usual.)
(IsotonicRegression's documentation should also be checked: it says y, weight should be "iterable", but they should be "array-like" since np.asarray doesn't work with all iterables.)
