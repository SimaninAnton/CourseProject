I am using version 0.11-git. When I tried to run wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py in examples/application directory, I got following error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py", line 175, in
U, s, V = randomized_svd(X, 5, q=3)
TypeError: randomized_svd() got an unexpected keyword argument 'q'
It seems after fast_svd was replaced by randomized_svd, keyword argument 'q' was left unchanged.
