I would like to suggest that the LOF score which is calculated and stored in the LOF class as negative_outlier_factor_ is publicly accessible.
scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/lof.py
Line 193 in 18cf2e5
 self.negative_outlier_factor_ = -np.mean(lrd_ratios_array, axis=1) 

With this change it would be possible to not only use the 1 and -1 for no outlier and outlier as result of the LOF algorithm but also the LOF score. Possible usage scenarios would be a visualisation for more interpretable results, another way to calculate the threshold, manual setting of the threshold...
If the community agrees with the change, I could make the modifications and submit a PR.
