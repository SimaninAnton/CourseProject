I don't know if I should post feature proposals here. A long awaited feature (which I am currently implementing by inheriting the requested object in a class modifier), is the ability of an sklearn object to accept as input flag one with a name like 'ignoreNone', which, if set True, would cause the object to ignore any samples that are None vectors and return (if needed) a None vector, dimensionally consistent with the output. In this way, the use of buffers and features consistency checkers could be implemented in a sklearn pipeline.
