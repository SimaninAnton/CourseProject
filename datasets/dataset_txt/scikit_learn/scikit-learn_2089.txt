I have written a custom predictor which can take in generators for the data to avoid issues with memory. When I try to optimise hyperparameters using a RandomizedSearchCV, sklearn throws up a validation error when trying to ensure that the input variables have a consistent number of samples so they are indexable. Sklearn looks at the generator and thinks it is a singleton array and subsequently throws an error. Would it be possible to add a flag to sidestep this validation of the input within sklearn as I am already carrying out the validation when I construct the generators.
