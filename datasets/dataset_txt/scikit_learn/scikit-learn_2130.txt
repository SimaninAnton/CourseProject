When you call sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split, the function returns X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test yet when you call a splitting class like KFold, it returns a index iterator. While I understand that one is a function and one is a class, I think that the user should be able to easily swap out splitting schemes. So, I think it might make sense to either update train_test_split to return indices or change the other splitters to return values.
