Hi
Regarding to documentation in recall_score page
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score
there is simple error in the definition of recall (as it is always confusing). It's mentioned that recall is tp / (tp + fn). But as it's calculated correctly, it is tp / (tp + tn).
