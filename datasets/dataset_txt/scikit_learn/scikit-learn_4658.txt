Hi,
there's an issue / bug with Support Vector Classification in v0.14.1 .
This used to work with 0.13xx
clf = pickle.load(open(path + '/SVM.p', 'rb'))
labels = clf.predict(allFeatureVectors)
but now fails with this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
labels = clf.predict(allFeatureVectors)
File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 466, in predict
y = super(BaseSVC, self).predict(X)
File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 284, in predict
return predict(X)
File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 300, in _dense_predict
svm_type = LIBSVM_IMPL.index(self._impl)
AttributeError: 'SVC' object has no attribute '_impl'
Captured from Macports installation but also observed with linux source installation.
Cheers!
