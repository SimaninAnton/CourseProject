I tried to use mutual_info_regression for feature selection along with SelectPercentile. My input data is a sparse matrix. Once I did the same thing on f_regression, it's pretty fast. While for mutual_info_regression it takes very long time. Is that because mutual_info_regression indeed does more complicated computation or it can speed up by some well-designed techniques?
