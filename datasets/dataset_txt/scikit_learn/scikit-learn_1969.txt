As raised in #9561, we should not be using isinstance(memory, Memory) to validate Memory arguments, as it's not straightforward for users to realise they need to use sklearn.externals.joblib.Memory (rather than joblib.Memory).
I think we should be using ducktyping wherever we check for memory. If a memory parameter has a method cache, we should treat it as Memory. We should have test cases with dummy replacements for memory that have the right cache interface to make sure this is sufficient for our needs.
This affects hierarchical clustering and Pipeline.
