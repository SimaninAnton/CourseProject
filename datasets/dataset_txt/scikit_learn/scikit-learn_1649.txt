scikit-learn uses libsvm and liblinear as backends for SVM. Alternatively ThunderSVM, an SVM implementation that can work on multiple CPU's or GPU's and so is faster then libsvm, can be used. It promises same functionality and interface as libsvm, so it seems that it could easily be added as an alternative backend for the SVM functions.
