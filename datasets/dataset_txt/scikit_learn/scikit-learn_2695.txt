Description
In the bleeding-edge installation instructions there is a link to the Nose testing package.
https://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/
but that page appears to be missing possibly permantly. I think it should be this -> http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
the original page on sci-kit.org is here -
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#install-bleeding-edge
