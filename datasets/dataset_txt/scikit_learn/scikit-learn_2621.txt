Feature scaling can be important for factors such as learning rate, numerical stability and regularisation. While we provide a useful set of tools for scaling, and apply StandardScaler in 12-or-so examples, it would be good to have examples that illustrate the impact/need for scaling, or why not, for datasets whose feature spaces have different shapes.
