pip instasll scikit-learn fails since setup.py of scikit-learn requires numpy and scipy to be pre-installed, but do not declare them in install_requires keyword argument of setup function.
What kind of reason do you guys decide not declaring dependencies numpy and scipy in setup.py? It's a bug or it's a feature?
