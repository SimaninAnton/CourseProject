I am trying to run a long series of linear classifiers on a long series of highly correlated datasets.
Is there a way I could initialize the classifier's coef before fitting so as to optimize computing time: e.g.
# run classic classifier
clf.fit(X_list[0], y_list[0])
coef = clf.coef_
...
# for each new fitting, start with preceeding hyperplan
for X, y in zip(X_list[1:], y_list[1:]):
    clf.fit(X, y, coef_start=coef)
    coef = clf.coef_
    ...
Thanks!
