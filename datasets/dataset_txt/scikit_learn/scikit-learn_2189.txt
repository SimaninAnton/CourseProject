from sklearn import datasets
print "[X] downloading data..."
dataset = datasets.fetch_mldata("MNIST Original")
(trainX, testX, trainY, testY) = train_test_split(
dataset.data / 255.0, dataset.target.astype("int0"), test_size = 0.16)
and the data was in this shape
trainX = [58000L,784L)
testX = [12000L, 10L)
trainX = [58000L,)
testX = [12000L, )
and now I am looking to import the cifar10 in the same way I imported the MNIST and return the same format. Any expert help related to import Cifar10 will be much appreciated.
regards
