I think there is no common test right now to check that the decision_function behavior is consistent across all estimators. We check that it is consistent with predict_proba and predict if the classes are [0, 1], but I don't think there is a test for [-1, 1] or arbitrary strings. I vaguely recall hard-coded cases for this, so I think adding a test would be really good.
