GMM is a clustering algorithm. Labels (y) are not used at all. There is an example which suggests that the labels will be used to train a classifier and the docstrings don't really help to clarify this. This might be very confusing especially for users that are new to machine learning.

What was the reasoning behind this? Did I miss something? Otherwise I will open a pull request to correct this.
