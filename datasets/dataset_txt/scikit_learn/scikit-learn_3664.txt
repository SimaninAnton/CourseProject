I've just been trying to get a handle on the GP code, and I feel like I've found a bug in the _arg_max_reduced_likelihood_function function of gaussian_process.py. The code minimises this function:
def minus_reduced_likelihood_function(log10t):
    return - self.reduced_likelihood_function(
                theta=10 ** log10t)[0]
However, the function reduced_likelihood_function already returns a negative log likelihood:
reduced_likelihood_function_value = - sigma2.sum() * detR
Perhaps I'm wrong here, but it looks like a mistake to me? The example in examples/plot_gp_regression.py seems to work anyway because the upper limit on the parameters just lead to reasonable parameters.
