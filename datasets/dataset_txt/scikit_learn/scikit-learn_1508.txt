There is a warning when importing 'make_pipeline' and 'make_union' in certain IDEs (PyCharm for instance) due to the fact that those function names are not included inside the '__all__' structure inside the sklearn.pipeline modules.
Solution:
How is it now?
__all__ = ['Pipeline', 'FeatureUnion']
How it should be?
__all__ = ['Pipeline', 'FeatureUnion', 'make_pipeline', 'make_union']
Versions:
It happens in the last version of the package (v. 0.19.1)
