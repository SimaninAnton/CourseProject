We are getting many warnings like PendingDeprecationWarning('the matrix subclass is not the recommended way to represent matrices or deal with linear algebra (see https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html). Please adjust your code to use regular ndarray. using numpy master (see logs at https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/builds/387352026)
Apart from a very long log, this causes test failures where we have used assert_no_warnings (which we could now be importing from numpy instead of having our own implementation).
It might be a good idea to remove all uses of np.matrix that raise warnings. On the other hand, we might also consider that assert_no_warnings shouldn't be bothered by PendingDeprecationWarnings.
