When training batches of data using partial_fit, replaying those same values back using predict often returns labels that are a single index off.
That is, training:
[1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
[2,3,4]
[5,6,7]
[5,6,7]
Will return predict results like:
[1,2,3] => 1
[2,3,4] => 1
[2,3,4] => 2
[5,6,7] => 2
[5,6,7] => 3
This is a simplified example but we have been seeing this sporadically for larger datasets.
Is this a new issue?
