In various sklearn Classes, raw String are used as ways of selecting strategies:
class sklearn.decomposition.PCA(n_components=None, copy=True, whiten=False,
                                svd_solver=’auto’, tol=0.0,
                                iterated_power=’auto’, random_state=None)
and the choice of svd_solver are
string {‘auto’, ‘full’, ‘arpack’, ‘randomized’}
I wonder why are they using simple String to select strategies. It's sometimes inconvenient to find the choice of strategies. Won't it be easier to use a static variable like
PCA.Svd_solver.AUTO
to generate documentation and easier for the user to select (no need to toggle between screens to check the spelling and can use tab completion)? And this still preserves the option to use just string.
