The GMM is redesigned and has a new name GaussianMixture.
Though there is no official conversion function, I already figured out how to convert a GMM object to a GaussianMixture one.
However I met a new problem when I upgraded the scikit-learn from 0.19 to 0.22. Now the old one GMM is removed so I cannot import the related pickles at all, unless I reinstall 0.19 which supports both, and then convert GMM to GaussianMixture by assigning parameters and attributes.
Is it possible to add support for the old GMM, even for loading purpose only? Either downgrading to 0.19 and then 0.22 or retraining the models is a pain.
