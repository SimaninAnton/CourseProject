Looking at https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/pca.py
The documentation says:
Maximum number of components to keep: default is 50.
But, the behavior is:
Maximum number of components to keep: default is X.shape[1], when calling fit().
However, if no value is passed, n_components is None:
def __init__(self, n_components=None, copy=True, iterated_power=3,
             whiten=False, random_state=None):
And, later, the shape of the X matrix is used.
if self.n_components is None:
n_components = X.shape[1]
I have not checked the other PCA methods in this file, just RandomizedPCA.
