I'm trying to follow along the example presented here on sparse feature recovery using a randomized lasso.
Part of that example requires fitting a LasoLarsCV estimator. However, when I try to fit that, I get an error, you can see the traceback here.
You can re-create this problem by downloading the data that I'm using here. Then try the following:
from scipy import io

matlab_dict = io.loadmat("LassoProblemData.mat")
X, y = matlab_dict["X"], matlab_dict["y"]
lars_cv = LassoLarsCV(cv=3, n_jobs=1)
lars_cv.fit(X, y)
