Hi,
I would like to propose the addition of a module for fitting user supplied parametric model structure to data.
I have created a class mimicking scikit-learn api structure which basically uses scipy.optimize.least_squares to find the parameter values for fitting the user supplied model.
Let me know if this would be a welcome addition to scikit-learn.
