The page says: "These functions return a dictionary-like object holding at least two items: an array of shape n_samples * n_features with key data (except for 20newsgroups) and a NumPy array of length n_features, containing the target values, with key target."
I'm pretty sure the array of target values should be of length n_samples. Also, n_features has double backticks around it instead of being highlighted.
