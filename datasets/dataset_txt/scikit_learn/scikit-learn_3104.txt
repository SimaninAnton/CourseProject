We use sklearn heavily and have always worked around a bit of non-determinism in our unit tests that SK Learn introduces.
We force in our random seed to be the same however this still didn't fix the issue.
We then saw when examining the LogisticRegressor that calls to sklearn.svm.base._fit_liblinear are NOT passing the random state along and are creating a new seed each call.
Attached is the patch, I will make a pull request likely for this.
