before version 0.20, OneHotEncoder did not support negative integers in input. Now it supports that case if the "new behaviour" is requested by instantiating it with categories='auto'. The legacy behaviour currently raises ValueError("X needs to contain only non-negative integers."). This error message should be extended to mention how the new behaviour can be activated.
