Hi!
Recently I found out that the function
_partition_estimators from
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1491c1cd065f2f620ce770b3540697b87fc192ea/sklearn/ensemble/base.py
if n_jobs == -1:
    n_jobs = min(cpu_count(), n_estimators)
else:
    n_jobs = min(n_jobs, n_estimators)
does not support negative values for n_jobs argument other than -1.
On the other hand, there are some places inside your library where it is supported:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a413f875f1a7c9528290e01e1c030c336b9f32e4/sklearn/externals/joblib/parallel.py
if n_jobs < 0 and mp is not None:
    n_jobs = max(mp.cpu_count() + 1 + n_jobs, 1)
I also noticed that your docs often doesn't mention the possibility of using values lower than -1
You can search the repo for n_jobs : integer, optional to see where.
If you want I can create a pull request to fix _partition_estimators.
