I think we're currently building the website for stable by hand - correct me if I'm wrong.
That seems a bit silly given our awesome automated setup. In particular this makes it harder to update the stable website, and it might lead to inconsistencies between stable and dev.
I think one possibility would be that all the 0.version.X branches built the docs and push them into the 0.version folder.
Thoughts?
