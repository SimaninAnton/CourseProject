One of the tutorial exercises does a grid search using SVC, searching only for C and not for gamma.
I think this is a very bad example. Never do that! Probably the best remedy would be to switch to a linear classifier. Or grid-search both gamma and C, but that might take longer and is not easily plotable (working on that).
