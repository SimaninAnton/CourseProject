Hello,
I am running some test with this database http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity
First I load it
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df=pd.read_csv('OnlineNewsPopularity.csv', skipinitialspace=True)
popular = df.ix[:,60] >= 1400 # or df.shares
unpopular = df.ix[:,60] < 1400
df.loc[popular,'shares'] = 1
df.loc[unpopular,'shares'] = 0
X = df[list(df.columns[2:60])]
y = df['shares']
Now I want to fit a SVM with polynomial kernel
from sklearn import svm, cross_validation
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='poly', degree = 5)
train_features, test_features, train_labels, test_labels = cross_validation.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.35, random_state=0)
clf.fit(train_features, train_labels)
I always and invariably get a
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
If I change the degree to 7, instead, it works fine. I work on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine, I am not sure what other information to give.
