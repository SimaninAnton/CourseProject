Hi,
I first trained and validated a network offline and saved the parameters of the network to a file. This works quite well.
My goal is now to train my network online with only few samples, to improve the initial model, starting from the trained network . I think the partial_fit method would work well in this situation. I set the learning rate very very low (1e-10), and this should allow me to get about the same validation scores as I got offline. I tried this, but the validation scores I get are really low, it means the NN generalize even with low learning rate .
I use set_params to change the learning rate of initial MLPClassifier ( 0.01 in offline to 0.00000000001 in online training) but if I change the learning rate to other random numbers, the validation scores still really low and does not vary. This makes me think that the value is being ignored.
Anyone can help me? Why this happens ? Thanks
