I load the dataset with load_svmlight_file()
Xc, yc = load_svmlight_file("../ch.vec", ch_feature)
and then fit it with
nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(Xc, yc)
And then the program crashed and no exception and warning message is displayed.
This problem is caused by off-by-one error. My feature index starts from 1, while load_svmlight_file() requires the index to start from 0. However, this exception behavior is quite confusing and very hard to debug.
