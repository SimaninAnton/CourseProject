I would like to propose an additional instance method to the ensemble estimators to fit additional sub-estimators. I kluged up an implementation for gradient boosting that appears to work through my limited testing. I was thinking the signature would be something like
def fit_extend(self, X, y, n_estimators):
where self.n_estimators += n_estimators is updated as so. I don't think fit_extend is a particularly great name so I'd welcome other suggestions. Perhaps we would want to hash the features and labels when fit() is called so we can check that the same features and labels are provided to this function.
If people think this would be a useful addition I would be willing to put together a PR, it seems like it should be straightforward to implement and add tests/docs for.
