Hi!
I've been working on implementing my own classes compatible with the Pipeline class. In order to do so, I impemented the fit and transform methods. The main difference of my classes are that I need to pass them several parameters in the fit and transformmethods associated to X and y. Then I realized that fit in the Pipeline has the **fit_params so I am using that variable, BUT the transform method doesn't have that variable...
Is there any reson that we cannot pass more parameters to the transform method? Is there a different way to pass other parameters different from (X and y) to that in a Pipeline? Can it be an improvement (it is easy, because you only have to add **transofrm_params to the calls in the pipeline.py file).
Thanks!
