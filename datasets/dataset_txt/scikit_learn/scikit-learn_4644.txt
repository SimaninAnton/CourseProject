The example code for dbscan (examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.py) calls plot for every point, making it much slower than it could be. On an old machine I measured 8 seconds for 2000 points, versus 0.2 seconds for passing each labeled cluster as an array of points. Also in general examples should present an approach people can put into their code, and pushing array work to numpy is better than looping at the high level.
This gist contains two alternative proposed changes:
https://gist.github.com/6847183.git
The first approach uses a numpy bitmask array, which I think is more straightforward. The second approach uses set functions.
(A side effect of the proposed change is the z-ordering now shows the non-core samples over the top of the core samples. I don't think it is very important but it is a visible difference.)
