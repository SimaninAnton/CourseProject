Hello,
I'm working on a project using RandomForestClassifier . I have an evaluation script which uses StratifiedKFold to evaluate the performance of the classifiers.
While running on scikit-learn 0.14 the evaluations are very high (around 90% precision and recall) however when I swap to scikit-learn 0.15 without touching anything else the performance drops (to around 60%).
This issue happens in python 2.7 and scikit-learn 0.15 ( I installed sklearn via :pip +git pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git )
Running my code on python 3.4 and scikit-learn-0.15, I also get a performance drop. No way to check this code in scikit-learn 0.14 since it does not seem to be compatible with python 3.4.
Finally, I tried different version combinations of : Numpy (1.8.0 & 1.8.1 ), and Scipy(0.14.0 & 0.15.0) however it was only swapping sklearn when variations in the performance ocurred.
I tried the combinations on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr installing the libraries system wide.
I also tried the combinations on OSX 10.8.2 installing the libraries in pyenv
Is there a known issues working with those classifiers in 0.15 ?
Is it scikit-learn 0.14 compatible with python 3.4 ? I get the following error when I try to install it:
sklearn/cluster/_k_means.c: In function â��__Pyx_TraceSetupAndCallâ��:

sklearn/cluster/_k_means.c:7955: error: â��PyFrameObjectâ�� has no member named â��f_tstateâ��

Thank you in Advance
