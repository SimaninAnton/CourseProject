While computing mean squared log error, values need to be checked greater than 0, however I found condition in sklearn.metrics.regression.mean_squared_log_error is not right.
if not (y_true >= 0).all() and not (y_pred >= 0).all():
        raise ValueError("Mean Squared Logarithmic Error cannot be used when "
                         "targets contain negative values.")
which checks only y_true and y_pred are both negative.
It should be
if not (y_true >= 0).all() or not (y_pred >= 0).all():
Correct me if I'm wrong, Thanks.
