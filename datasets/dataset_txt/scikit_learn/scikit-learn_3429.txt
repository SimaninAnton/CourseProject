Having trained a classifier (a pipeline involving a CountVectorizer and a RandomForestClassifier) with GridSearchCV, I had a print clf.best_estimator_. To my dismay, after running for two days it printed:
Pipeline(steps=[('vect', CountVectorizer(analyzer=u'word', binary=False, decode_error=u'strict',
        dtype=<type 'numpy.int64'>, encoding=u'utf-8', input=u'content',
        lowercase=True, max_df=0.5, max_features=None, min_df=1,
        ngram_range=(1, 1), preprocessor=None, stop_words=None,
        st...n_jobs=1,
            oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,
            warm_start=False))])
with a ... in place of all the parameters I was trying to train. If there's not a compelling case for the truncation, IMO it's much less surprising to print everything.
