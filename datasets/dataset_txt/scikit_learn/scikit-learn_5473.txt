Hello,
When I run the ARDRegression algorithm I get the "array is too big" error. The data is indeed large about 113K records or 11 integer columns.
Is there a work around for this issue ?
Are there methods for the learner to load the data progressively ?
If I divide the data into chunks and train the algorithm sequentially what is the effect ? I know this sounds really stupid but how can I divide the work in smaller pieces.
