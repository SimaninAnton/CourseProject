BernoulliRBM is an online model but the incremental learning method is hidden in the private _fit API.
BernoulliRBM should have a public partial_fit akin to the one in MinibatchKMeans and MinibatchDictionaryLearning (along with tests and maybe an example using the digits dataset and random nudging to generate an infinite stream of samples while monitory the performance accuracy of a stacked linear model trained on a fix heldout training set and tested on a fix validation set).
