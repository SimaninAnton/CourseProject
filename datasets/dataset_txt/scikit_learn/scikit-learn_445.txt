There are a few test failures in https://github.com/MacPython/scikit-learn-wheels/commits/master cron job, that would need fixing before the 0.21.3 release (#14188). Currently at least the following fails,
(I haven't checked all the build so this might need updating).
It might also be good (though less critical) to wait until ARM and PPC builds succeed at conda-forge/scikit-learn-feedstock#98 and fix the potentially failing tests there.
