roc_auc_score documentation does not specify order of returned values when called with average=none
For example:
np.random.seed(42)
classes = 10
samples = 3000
y_true = LabelBinarizer().fit_transform(np.random.randint(classes, size=samples))
y_score = np.random.rand(samples, classes)
roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score, average=None)
Returns an array:
array([0.50624445, 0.49551979, 0.50689782, 0.51084903, 0.49133162,
       0.49013407, 0.49122342, 0.47643195, 0.51931455, 0.48301647])
It's not specified in documentation what is the order of classes and thus returned values.
Since auc has no reorder any more it is not even clear if the order as returned by roc_auc_score is compatible with previous versions (it seems so). It would be preferable to have this behavior documented somehow.
