Hi All,
I am pre-processing images for feature extraction and feeding the extracted features to LDA for dimensionality reduction. I have a total of 5 classes and getting 4-dimensional data after reduction. However, I am getting an error "Variables are collinear". I have checked the discriminant_analysis.py code and came to know that rank< number of features. Rank of a matrix in my case is 1000 and number of features are 10000. Here are my questions.....
Is it good to go for classification with such reduced data? or is it simply over fitted?
If overfitted, how to reduce overfitting of collinear data?
Please help!!
