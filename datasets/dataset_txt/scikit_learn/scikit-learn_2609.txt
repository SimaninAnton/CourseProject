Our documentation builder is currently not running unless files under doc/ or examples/ are modified (see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/build_tools/circle/check_build_doc.py#L65). However, it can be worth compiling the docs to view docstrings, as in #7804. I suspect it'll be hard to check if a docstring is modified, but is it especially harmful to run the Circle CI build in all cases?
