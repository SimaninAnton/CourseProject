Description
I am trying to train a MLPClassifier with the MNIST dataset and then run a GridSearchCV, Validation Curve and Learning Curve on it. Every time any cross-validation starts (either with GridSearchCV, learning_curve, or validation_curve), Python crashes unexpectedly.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
neural_net = MLPClassifier(solver='lbfgs', activation='logistic',
random_state=RANDOM_STATE,
verbose=10, max_iter=20,
early_stopping=True)
learning_curve(estimator=neural_net,
X=X_train,
y=y_train,
cv=10,
n_jobs=-1,
verbose=10)
Expected Results
Actual Results
PyCharm crashes with the following error:
These are the logs that I get from the console before the crash:
