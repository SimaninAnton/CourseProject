I'm not sure what's causing this, but after upgrading I noticed exploding memory usage (several GB in use) when I tried to run Lasso or LassoCV on my dataset.
Lasso in particular was a big difference--the version in 0.12.1 would use on the order of 100 MB of memory and finish quickly, while doing the same thing in 0.13.1 hit 5+ GB and I had to kill it. The story for LassoCV was similar but it uses more memory overall (<1 GB for 0.12.1, maybe GB for 0.13.1).
Presumably the leak is in Lasso, although I'm not sure why LassoCV is using so much more (shouldn't it use the same amount?). Maybe there is a separate leak in LassoCV in 0.12.1, and in 0.13.1 this explodes due to the new Lasso leak.
On my laptop this renders these methods unusable--it starts to swap and it's way too slow.
edit: I am using numpy 1.6.2, based on other tickets I will upgrade and see if this fixes the problem.
