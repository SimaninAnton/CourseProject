It seems many SVM examples got screwed up by the recent "scale_C" change. For example the plot comparing different kernels and the plot showing decision boundaries for unbalanced data.
Also, I noticed there is no suggestion on how to set C (or gamma) in the narrative. I thought it was there before and I think it should be there... saying something like: do cross-validation with exponential spacing. The ranges where one has to search changed dramatically with the "scale_C" change... obviously ;)
