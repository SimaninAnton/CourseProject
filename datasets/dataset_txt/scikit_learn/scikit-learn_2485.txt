Description
Setting n_neighbors to different values does not change the MI score returned by mutual_info_regression.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py#L196
n_neighbors seems to be passed to _estimate_mi but not actually used in the function.
