Description
VotingClassifier has no fit_params in the fit() method
Expected Results
A user might want to pass additional fit parameters to the classifiers included by VotingClassifier. That's for example the behaviour of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV (which are not meta-models themselves, but I think the same argument applies).
I would assume that instead of simple **fit_params one would need to pass a list of tuples (name, fit_params_dict) to be able to pass different fit parameters to different models.
I was not able to find a similar discussion in other issues.
Actual Results
At the moment VotingClassifier.fit() takes only X, y, sample_weight=None
Versions
