I was just looking at k_means_.py and it looks as if the default initialisation method for the kmeans object is "random" where for the k_means function (which I guess can be called directly), it is "k-means++".
Is that for any particular reason? Otherwise I would use the same method for both of them to be more consistent.
Another thing in the same place: for k_means, init can be a callable according to the docstring, but how this possibility behaves is not explained.
