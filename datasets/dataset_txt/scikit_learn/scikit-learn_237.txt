Both KNeighborsClassifier and KNeighborsRegressor don't have an "attributes" part in the docs:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier
solution
For the classifier, I think one should add:
classes_
effective_metric_
effective_metric_params_
outputs_2d_
For the regressor it's just
effective_metric_
effective_metric_params_
