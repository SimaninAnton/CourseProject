I am new to scikit-learn but so far I do like it. I got a problem on my text analysis in Thai language. I am using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to extract features (words) and debugging with Lime tool. I found that the words are broken.

The correct is this.
When I look at text.py in feature_extraction I found that normalized in strip_accents_unicode is set as 'NFKD'.
def strip_accents_unicode(s):
    normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', s)
    print
    if normalized == s:
        return s
    else:
        return ''.join([c for c in normalized if not unicodedata.combining(c)])
I wonder is there any way to handle the another normalization forms for non-English language.
Thank you.
