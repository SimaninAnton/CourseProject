Description
I run the demo code at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_unveil_tree_structure.html and I think the expected output of the second part Rules used to predict sample 0 should be the decision path for sample 0.
However the code will only give the leaves rule for sample 0. Therefore I think the first if clause in the for loop should be if leave_id[sample_id] == node_id instead of if leave_id[sample_id] != node_id.
Expected Results
Rules used to predict sample 0: 
decision id node 0 : (X_test[0, 3] (= 2.4) > 0.800000011920929)
decision id node 2 : (X_test[0, 2] (= 5.1) > 4.949999809265137)
Actual Results
Rules used to predict sample 0: 
decision id node 4 : (X_test[0, -2] (= 5.1) > -2.0)
