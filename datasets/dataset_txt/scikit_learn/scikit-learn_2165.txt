Description
When fitting a MultiTaskElasticNetCV (and perhaps other coordinate descent models, I haven't tried them yet), I get different results depending on the order of my samples
Maybe I'm just being dense, but I was unaware that coordinate descent could yield different results depending on sample order. If this is intended, feel free to close.
A possible fix would be to just shuffle the data (wrt the random seed) before running the optimization algorithm; this could probably be another constructor argument for the object.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
A bit overloaded right now, so I can't come up with a minimal example right now. I just wanted to put this on the radar, though.
Expected Results
Results of two identical models with identical random seeds when fit on input X are identical no matter the order of the samples within X.
Actual Results
Two identical models with identical random seeds, when fit on an input X with different row (sample) ordering, give different results.
