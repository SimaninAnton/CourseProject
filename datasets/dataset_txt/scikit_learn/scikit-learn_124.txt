Description
sklearn.utils.deprecated modifies the docstring of a function or a class to warn users for the deprecation. However it does not seem to render very well with the documentation because it adds a definition description which adds a lot of indentations.
Example
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence.partial_dependence.html#sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence.partial_dependence
https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence.partial_dependence.html#sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence.partial_dependence
Solution
I think that there could be two solutions:
finding why it adds a definition description and removing it, or
removing the update of the docstring since there already is a directive from sphinx.
