Hej together, I just tried to compile the following code and got an Error for Ward when I searched for too few clusters:
File: "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py", line 169, in ward_tree: inert, i, j = heappop(inertia)
IndexError: index out of range
import sklearn.datasets, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.cluster
X = sklearn.datasets.load_digits().data
connectivity = sklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph(X, n_neighbors=10)
n_clusters = 6
ward = sklearn.cluster.Ward(n_clusters=n_clusters, connectivity=connectivity).fit(X)
This problem also arises for other examples when I reduce n_clusters.
Can anybody help me, please?
Best, wedge
