The RandomizedPCA algorithm is great - you can perform PCA much quicker and on larger data sets that otherwise would either take too long or take up too much RAM. However, the original data set still needs to fit into memory. I was wondering if there was an out-of-core algorithm for PCA and from Googling, there seems to be one:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.5510.pdf
It's by the same authors as the current RandomizedPCA algorithm and it would be great to see this implemented as well. This seems really useful to me and with this, scikit learn can deal with datasets of any size!
Interested to hear your thoughts on this.
