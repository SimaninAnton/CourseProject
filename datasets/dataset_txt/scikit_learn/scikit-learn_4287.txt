If you have differently scaled features, the calculation of the shrinkage parameter using the algorithm by Ledoit and Wolf yields an incorrect estimate if the data are not standardized. Therefore, the function ledoit_wolf_shrinkage in shrunk_covariance_.py should standardize the data before computing the shrinkage parameter, and then scale the shrunk covariance matrix back at the end.
