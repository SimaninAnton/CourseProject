It seems that the DeprecationWarning filter in utils/init.py has a global effect, thus forcing the user to see all deprecation warnings of all imported packages with no way to silence them:
> python -W ignore -c 'import warnings; import sklearn.utils; warnings.warn("foo", DeprecationWarning)'
-c:1: DeprecationWarning: foo
