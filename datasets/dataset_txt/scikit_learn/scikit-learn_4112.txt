The n_components parameter is overwritten by the number of connected components found using sparsetools.connected_components over here, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py#L62 . Also the attribute n_component_ is almost always equal to the parameter n_component over here (unless returned by scipy.cluster.hierarchy, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py#L248 .
If it is unused, I think we should just deprecate it.
