We recently deprecated sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer and replaced it with sklearn.impute (#10483). But we forgot to remove references to the deprecated class from doc/modules/preprocessing.rst. Please remove them, and perhaps leave a note pointing to the new documentation at doc/modules/impute.rst.
