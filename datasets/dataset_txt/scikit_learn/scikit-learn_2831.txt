From the docstring I would expect min_weight_fraction_leaf to have a similar effect as min_samples_leaf, but it doesn't, as shown by the code below:
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

data = load_digits(10)
features, labels = data.data, data.target
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.2).fit(features, labels)
tree.tree_.value.sum(axis=2).min()
1
There is leafs with single data points, but that's less than 0.2 * n_samples.
@rhiever reported this.
