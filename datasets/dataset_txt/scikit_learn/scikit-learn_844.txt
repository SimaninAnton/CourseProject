Some of our class doc examples don't include imports, I'd argue that we should include all the imports so that users can run these examples directly (maybe it's acceptable to omit import numpy as np)
E.g., https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances_chunked.html
I think at least we should add from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances_chunked
and maybe import numpy as np
