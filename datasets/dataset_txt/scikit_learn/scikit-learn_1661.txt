When using train_test_split(X,y), the split ignores the category in y.
For example, at the following code:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import datasets
from collections import Counter
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.5, random_state=5)
print(Counter(y_train))
print(Counter(y_test))
# output
# Counter({0: 28, 2: 26, 1: 21})
# Counter({1: 29, 2: 24, 0: 22})
The splitted output of the classes is not even, there are 28 vs 22 samples of the 0 category, although the test size is 0.5 so they should be of equal sizes.
