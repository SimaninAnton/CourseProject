I found an MIT Licensed Convolutional Neural Network
https://github.com/siddharth950/Convolutional-Neural-Network/blob/master/convolutionalNeuralNetwork.py
It might be useful to include in sklearn/neuralnetwork
Not sure if it gives the correct results. Someone might want to unit test it and rewrite it in cython.
