Would like to submit a PR if I get consensus on a proposal to change the "most_frequent" parameter to "mode" in preprocessing's Imputer. This change would ensure consistency with the majority of stats/ml libraries and literature such as scipy.stats.mstats.mode, Python 3.0's statistics.mode, and standard library functions in R, Julia, etc.
Thanks,
KD
