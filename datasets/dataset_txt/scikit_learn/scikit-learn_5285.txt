The GridSearchCV.grid_scores_ are stored in a not very user-friendly way.
It would be great to have nd-arrays and a set of labels.
Things that should be easily possible:
plot in the case of 1 parameter
matshow in the case 2 parameters
look at slices and "marginals' (mean over rest of parameters) when looking at more parameters
