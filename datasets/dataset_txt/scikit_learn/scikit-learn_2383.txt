From the paper "Predicting Good Probabilities With Supervised Learning" it seems "reliability diagram" is a common name for the calibration curve, but it's not mentioned in the text. Googling for "reliability diagram python" looks like it doesn't exist. That's not great.
Also, we might want to cite one of the papers describing the method in the docstring.
