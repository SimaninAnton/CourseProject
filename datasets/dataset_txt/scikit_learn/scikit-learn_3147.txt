Can anyone tell me why I get an error in one case and no error in the second case below? I am using a Gaussian Process Classifier with Noise - and I am trying to add the noise calculation to the observations.
When I do the array addition this way:
y += noise
I get a type error: TypeError: Cannot cast ufunc add output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind'
When I do the array addition this way: y = (y + noise) I get no type error
