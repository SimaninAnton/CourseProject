Hi, when I use pyinstaller 2.0 to compile the following code into .exe file:
from time import sleep
from sklearn.externals.joblib import Parallel, delayed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    r = Parallel(n_jobs=2, verbose=5)(delayed(sleep)(.1) for _ in range(10))
it will report the following errors:
C:\Users\Yin Song\Documents\scilearn-examples\pyinstaller-pyinstaller-61571d6\jo
blib_test2\dist>joblib_test2.exe
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>

allel", line 477, in __call__
ImportError: [joblib] Attempting to do parallel computingwithout protecting your
 import on a system that does not support forking. To use parallel-computing in
a script, you must protect you main loop using "if __name__ == '__main__'". Plea
se see the joblib documentation on Parallel for more information
But the code works perfectly when not compiled with pyinstaller. Can anyone do me the favor to check what the wrong is? Or privde a recipe to use pyinstaller to compile scilearn codes with parallel computing process? thanks very much!
