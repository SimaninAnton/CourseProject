Hiï¼Œ I found the code in this
scikit-learn/sklearn/cluster/birch.py
Line 212 in bac89c2
 self.update_split_subclusters( 
line would cause this error.
Because new_subcluster1, new_subcluster2 created by
new_subcluster1, new_subcluster2 = split_node(
closest_subcluster.child, threshold, branching_factor)
are constructed with
new_subcluster1 = _CFSubcluster()
new_subcluster2 = _CFSubcluster()
so, the problem is when calls the function update_split_subclusters in line
scikit-learn/sklearn/cluster/birch.py
Line 164 in bac89c2
 def update_split_subclusters(self, subcluster, 
, there will call 'self.init_centroids_[ind] = new_subcluster1.centroid_'.
But this construction method of 'new_subcluster1 = CFSubcluster()' has no attribute 'centroid'.
Can you help me to fix this issue? Thanks.
