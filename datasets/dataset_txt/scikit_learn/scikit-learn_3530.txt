Looks like the example are dependent on a very recent version of matplotlib, and that breaks CircleCI (our new CI infrastructure that is meant for testing the examples:):
https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/51
Specifically, in plot_gpc.py, there is, on line 95, plt.colorbar(label="Log-marginal Likelihood")
And the version of matplotlib that we have doesn't like the 'label' argument to colorbar.
