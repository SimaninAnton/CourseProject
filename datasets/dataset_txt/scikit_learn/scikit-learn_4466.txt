Only the first method works - the second method says
This function, 'sklearn.test()' does not do anything. It does not run the tests and will be removed in release 0.16.
The third method builds in-place correctly, but make test fails with the message It seems that scikit-learn has not been built correctly. It would be good to get one of these methods working (or something like it), as it is good to be able to test sklearn without having to install it first.
Also, is there a way to just run nosetests on a single test file, or a small subset of test files?? If only a small part of the code is being worked on, it is very useful to just be able to test the parts of the code that are being modified.
