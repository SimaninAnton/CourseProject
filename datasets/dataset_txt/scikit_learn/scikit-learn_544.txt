Like many others (1, 2, 3), I've experienced a lot of confusion due to the definition of r2_score in sklearn. I think that some better documentation could help clarify what's going on.
The r2_score user guide links to the Coefficient of Determination wikipedia page, which mentions that the most general form of R^2 is also known as the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient. This appears to be the definition of R^2 which is used in sklearn.
Is this correct? If so, I can open a PR to update the docs. IMO it would be useful to include this information not only in the User Guide but also in places where r2_score is used, like the score method for linear regression models (example). Sklearn uses a non-standard definition for R^2, and I think this should be made clear.
