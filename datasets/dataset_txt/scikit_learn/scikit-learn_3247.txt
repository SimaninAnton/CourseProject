I seem to be getting inconsistent/unexpected results when using t-SNE (compared to other implementations). I've uploaded and documented a reproducible example, together with some observations which may help someone to arrive to the root cause, as I'm stuck.

Thanks in advance for anyone looking into this.
Cheers,
