I think out of confusion with markdown and other RST constructs, some of the Sphinx documentation intends <code>/<tt>-like fixed-width font but uses only a single backtick instead of double. Ignoring docstrings for the moment, we find >280 cases with the following command:
git grep -E " \`[^\`]+\`[^_]" doc
I think all are markup errors, but not all have the same resolution.
