irc.freenode.net (referred as a contact point for scikit-learn at the bottom of readme.rst) points to a default new apache server page
it seems wechat.freenode.net (as provided by freednode.net mainpage) does allow access to the #scikit-learn irc.
possibly this might want to be considered as a replacement to prevent people being pointed to empty pages
