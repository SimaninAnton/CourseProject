People often ask about libraries for recommendation engines.
There is a good summary here: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-open-source-package-to-build-a-recommender-system-in-Python/answer/Xavier-Amatriain?srid=cgo
I think we might want to add this to the FAQ, either by linking to it, or by putting this listing in the "related packages" page and then linking to that from the FAQ.
