If I make a custom scorer with make_scorer, is this scorer only used in GridSearchCV and cross_val_score for scoring, or is it also used as the objective function for optimizing my estimator during training?
I come from stackoverflow and found conflicting answers here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40720878/customize-loss-function-sklearn
Thanks
