A naive implementation, not optimed code complexity.
This has a cost of O(#features* #samples * log(#samples)) at each node, leading to a total cost over the entire trees (by summing the cost at each node) of O(O(#features* #samples^2 * log(#samples))) .

I think again and again. But I don't understand the complexity. Would someone explains this, thank you sincerely!
