Various Agglomerative Clustering on a 2D embedding of digits

Is there any way we can reduce the time it takes to make this doc? It is way, way slower than the rest. For this plot, it is 320 seconds, versus approximately 90 seconds for the next worst plot (LARS image denoising... which is next on my list to look at). All others besides a few seem to be in the 2 to 10 second range.
