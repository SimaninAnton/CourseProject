_fit_and_score has an option to return times that is being used increasingly, as in #7325. It currently includes:
fit time
test set scoring time
when return_train_score=True, train set scoring time
I think perhaps we should pull this last bit out of the fit-and-score time. It's very minor except for slow predictors where the user may want return_train_score not to affect times. Any quick opinions?
