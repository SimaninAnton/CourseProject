Description
SelectFromModel's transform raises ValueError if any value is infinite or NaN - however the values aren't actually used anywhere, so it seems to me that this check (check_array using default True value for parameter force_all_finite) could be lifted. as some models are capable of working with such values (e.g. tree based models should handle infinities properly). This could also apply to some other feature selection methods.
