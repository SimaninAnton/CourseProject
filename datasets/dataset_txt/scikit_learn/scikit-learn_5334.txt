When training a LinearSVM with the .fit() method I have no problem, but when using .cross_validation.cross_val_score I get an error evaluating.
The error is :
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 703, in predict
X = self._validate_for_predict(X)
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py", line 752, in _validate_for_predict
if self._sparse and not sp.isspmatrix(X):
AttributeError: 'LinearSVC' object has no attribute '_sparse'
The Code working correctly:
classifier.fit(tfidfSparceTr, trLabels)
score = classifier.score(tfidfSparceTr, trLabels)
scores = numpy.array([score])
results = lassifier.predict(tfidfSparseEv)
The code giving error:
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score (classifier, tfidfSparceTr, trLabels, cv=5)
results = lassifier.predict(tfidfSparseEv)
On MacOx Lion with Python 2.7 and using scikit 0.11
PS: The correct code is for testing purpose only, as cross_val was not working.
