I installed scikit-learn 0.18.dev0 successfully inside my anaconda distribution. But when i running IsolationForest now i am getting the following error
"ImportError: dlopen(/Users/Uzwal/anaconda/lib/python2.7/sitepackages/sklearn/metrics/pairwise_fast.so, 2): Library not loaded: libmkl_intel_lp64.dylib
Referenced from: /Users/Uzwal/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/pairwise_fast.so
Reason: image not found "
Can anybody help me i have been trying to use IsolationForest since yesterday but running through issues everytime ? Thanks in advance
