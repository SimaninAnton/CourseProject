when constructing the estimators in _parallel_build_estimators the code save which samples where used estimators_samples.append(samples), however in the case of boostraping, when one example may be used more than once, that information is not stored since:
sample_counts = np.bincount(indices, minlength=n_samples)
samples = sample_counts > 0.
So you cant actually reconstruct the estimator.
