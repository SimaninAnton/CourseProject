We've moved away from the default precision/recall/f-score being a prevalence-weighted macro-average (average="weighted") to requiring the user to specify an option, on the basis that the weighted average is somewhat non-standard / not in textbooks. The example at examples/model_selection/grid_search_digits.py still uses the weighted average, as do some docstrings. We should identify if a more standard averaging option is appropriate to illustrate the point in each case.
