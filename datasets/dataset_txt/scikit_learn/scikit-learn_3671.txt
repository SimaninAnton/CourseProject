There is not really any real-world binary classification dataset in scikit-learn.
I find this a bit frustrating because it means that every time I want to explain AUC I have to make one of the datasets binary, which seems very unnatural.
Does anyone have a good idea for a binary dataset? Should we include one from UCI?
I know we already have too many loaders, but this seems like such a basic thing.
