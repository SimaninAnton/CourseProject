Would it be possible to extend generalized linear models to take a scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator as argument? I would like to reimplement Chartrand's numerical differentiation approach (Numerical Differentiation of Noisy, Nonsmooth Data, Chartrand 2011) using sklearn's implementation of Lasso. Briefly, the matrix X is full of 0's above the diagonal and 1's on and below it (i.e., it is an integration operator); so it can trivially be implemented as a LinearOperator (via cumsum), but it is not sparse.
