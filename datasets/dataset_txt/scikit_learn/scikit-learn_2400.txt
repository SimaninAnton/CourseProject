For some context see #8252.
This would be useful to implement @jmetzen's #8252 (comment).
However, there is also the parameter alphaof GaussianProcessRegressor, which does exactly this and is even easier to use (please see here). It defaults to alpha=1e-10 which should ensure in theory that the kernel is positive definite. If you encounter numerical problems, increasing alpha by a few orders of magnitude should be sufficient. However, the current behavior of throwing a LinAlgError is clearly not very user-friendly. At the very least, a useful error with the suggestion of increasing alpha should be thrown. If someone volunteers, it should be relatively easy to add (just catch LinAlgError and throw an appropriate Exception with a useful error string).
