From the response to this Stack Overflow question, it appears that there currently is no way to programmatically tell if an estimator supports sparse matrices as input to the fit method. This would really help out the SKLL project, as we currently just have a set of all the ones that we know do not support sparse.
The only programmatic way I'm aware of to do this currently is terribly hacky/brittle:
'sparse matrix' in estimator.fit.__doc__
