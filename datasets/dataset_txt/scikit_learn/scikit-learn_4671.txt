The following files under sklearn contain a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python)
sklearn/datasets/setup.py
sklearn/gaussian_process/gaussian_process.py
sklearn/gaussian_process/regression_models.py
sklearn/gaussian_process/init.py
sklearn/gaussian_process/correlation_models.py
Shebang should be used only for scripts that need direct execution for the application. Library modules shouldn't have shebang as they shouldn't be executable directly by the user.
Additionally, the file sklearn/gaussian_process/gaussian_process.py has a from __future__ import ... in the first line, even before the shebang
