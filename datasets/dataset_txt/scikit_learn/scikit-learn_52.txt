Description
The user guide for log loss (section 3.3.2.11) says (in the second paragraph, just before the equation):
the log loss per sample is the negative log-likelihood of the classifier given the true label
I think that this is backwards; I think that it's the negative log-likelihood of the true label given the probability predictions from the classifier. The equation in the subsequent line has the conditioning on the predictions. Also, the documentation for the function metrics.log_loss describes it as I wrote it.

I'm looking at the documentation for sklearn 0.22.1.
