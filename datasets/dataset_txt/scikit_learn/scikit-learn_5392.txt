I have used both svm.OneClassSVM() and svm.sparse.OneClassSVM() and they return always the following error:
NOTE: The Input matrix for fit() is Spase csr

ValueError: X and y have incompatible shapes: (180, 255) vs (0,)
Note: Sparse matrices cannot be indexed w/boolean masks (use indices=True
in CV).
