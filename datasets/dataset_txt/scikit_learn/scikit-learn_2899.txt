The biclustering module currently takes an affinity matrix to fit. I think we should change that API to accepting a data matrix. We did something similar with the clustering algorithms for a more uniform API. We need to introduce a "precomputed" parameter and some default way to compute the affinity matrix, which could just be the dot product. If this is not a good one, maybe use RBF...
