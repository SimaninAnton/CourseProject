I think it's weird that we don't have a linear classifier with an elasticnet penalty (apart from SGDClassifier which is kinda hard to use). Maybe we should add that to the lbfgs solver in logistic regression?
glmnet does that afaik.
I'm not sure if I opened this issue before... I got a slight deja-vu.
