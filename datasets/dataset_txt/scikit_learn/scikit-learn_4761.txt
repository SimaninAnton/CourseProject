As noted here:

for this page:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_iris.html#example-ensemble-plot-forest-iris-py
the documentation looks broken. Several formatting changes need to be made.
Separately the auto-generated image isn't being generated for the above web page, this probably isn't an issue with the updated python code (and may be related to a Sphinx problem as noted by OG in the comment linked above).
