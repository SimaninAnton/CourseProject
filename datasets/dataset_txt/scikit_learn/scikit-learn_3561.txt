The current documentation (0.16.1) does not mention that you can pass in (and will get as output) pandas data frames to the train_test_split method. This was especially unfortunate given that the change between 0.15* to 0.16 resulted in a different output when a pandas dataframe is used as input (.15 returns numpy arrays, and .16 returns a list of pandas dataframes).
