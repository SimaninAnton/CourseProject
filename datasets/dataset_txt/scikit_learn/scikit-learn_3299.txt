in the page " http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_image_denoising.html#example-decomposition-plot-image-denoising-py"
almost at the end of the code, there is TWO same IF statement, just like this:
if 'threshold' == transform_algorithm: # normalization
patches -= patches.min()
patches /= patches.max()
i comment out the FIRST one and just leave the 2nd, it give no different result to the original .
so, why?
