We're getting the following during sphinx-build:
*** Error in `/home/circleci/miniconda/envs/testenv/bin/python': free(): corrupted unsorted chunks: 0x000055d404a417c0 ***
Makefile:43: recipe for target 'html' failed
make: *** [html] Aborted
Exited with code 2
I'm guessing this will go away if we clear Circle's cache, but I can't see a UI widget for that and haven't worked out how to do it otherwise yet.
