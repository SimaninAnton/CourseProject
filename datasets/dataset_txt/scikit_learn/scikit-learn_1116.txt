Is this of interest to scikit-learn scipy/scipy#9205 ? I'm not sure where the distinction between scikit-learn and scipy is for distance stuff, though it does appear that scikit-learn implements it's own distance calculations, so this possibly would be of benefit. I did see an obvious application of this for scikit-learn (linked near the bottom of the post), so it's possibly useful.
Cc @jakevdp as you seem to have a bit of involvment in (at least) the neighbours stuff.
Anyway - if it's of interest, let me know, and I'll aim to work on it after scipy. Similar comments to the questions I asked there could be useful (e.g. existing benchmarks, functions where it could be useful, etc.).
