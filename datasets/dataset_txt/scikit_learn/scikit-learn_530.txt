When I was debugging #13761 (comment), I discovered that Linux py35_conda_openblas and Linux py35_np_atlas in the continuous integration misinterpret numpy boolean indexing.
Example
Let a be a numpy array.
Code
a[[False, True, True, False, True]]
Wrong interpretaton (Linux py35_conda_openblas and Linux py35_np_atlas)
a[[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]]
Right interpretation (the other builds)
a[[1, 2, 4]]
See the numpy manual v1.11 for reference.
Cause
It might be outdated dependency. The upstream bug might have been corrected.
Workaround
Use numpy.nonzero() explicitly for boolean indexing.
