Currently, KMeans supports mainly two types of initializations:
kmeans++
select training points at random
Another strategy we could add is to generate the initial cluster assignments randomly and take the averages of the points in each cluster as initial clusters. I must admit I don't know how well it works in practice but it seems easy to implement and could potentially be useful to some users.
