I've written code to compare Kaggle's and sklearn's ROC AUC, and they appear to be very different.
The code to reproduce my results you can find here:
https://github.com/IraKorshunova/metrics_test
It gives:
Public Kaggle AUC: 0.77880025032
Public Sklearn AUC 0.757001519802
AUC package in R gives the same score as Kaggle.
