Hi there, first of all sorry for skipping the recommended issue template, but this is purely documentation related so I'm not sure it is applicable.
In the documentation for SVM RBF parameters, the following is stated:
The C parameter trades off misclassification of training examples against
simplicity of the decision surface. A low C makes the decision surface
smooth, while a high C aims at classifying all training examples correctly
by giving the model freedom to select more samples as support vectors.
Is this correct? I agree that a low C makes the margin larger and more smooth, and that a high C will enforce a smaller margin in order to more rigorously meet the training samples, but intuitively would that not mean that the number of support vectors would be lower for higher values of C? If a support vector is defined as "a point on/within the margin" then a larger margin would select more samples as support vectors.
Sorry if I have misunderstood anything.
