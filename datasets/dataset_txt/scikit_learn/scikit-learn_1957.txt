Description
Would there be interest in implementing a random forest based imputer in the vein of missForest? Something (somewhat) related is in the works here but it appears the PR is only planning to support RF estimation with NaN and not imputation per se. IMO, this would be a useful addition to the Imputer "suite", especially given RF-based imputation has been shown to perform quite competitively compared to other imputation methods in a number of empirical studies (see here and here). Anyway, if there is interest, I would like to start working on this.
Reference R package: missForest
Paper: MissForest—non-parametric missing value imputation for mixed-type data
PS: @jnothman if you are rolling your eyes, let me just say that I understand :)
UPDATE (+ shameless plug :D) - I have implemented the MissForest algorithm in the missingPy package. It can perform Random Forest based imputation of numerical, categorical, as well as mixed-type data.
