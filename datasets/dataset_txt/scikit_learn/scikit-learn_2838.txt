Hopefully this is the right location to post this.
I found what seems to be a typo in the documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric.html
It says maching instead of matching under the boolean metric section.
I believe I tracked it down to this line: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/0.17.X/sklearn/neighbors/dist_metrics.pyx#L178
