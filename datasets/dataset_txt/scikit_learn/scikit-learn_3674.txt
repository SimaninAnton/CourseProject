Based on a reading the documentation, it seems that the only way to perform the machine learning operations on a dataset is if the dataset is already affiliated with scikit in some way, such as if it were made with randomization through a sklearn function, or if it were loaded from some database. Is there a way for a user to create a dataset by themselves that they can load into the function, and then perform the operation?
