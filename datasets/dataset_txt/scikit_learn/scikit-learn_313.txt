We used to have those but stopped. Dask has release highlights with small code snippets to illustrate the new cool features. This is great, let's do that too!
Since we're also considering updating the docs style / layout, we might also consider having a "release highlights" section (or even a "blog" section??).
But meanwhile, I guess a first decent attempt is to have release notes for 0.22 in a nice html-rendered example.
I'll try to submit something soon
