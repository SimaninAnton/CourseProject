It seems that there is no support in sklearn to use Panda's Categorical datatype directly in fitting models. The Categorical datatype is convenient since it encodes categorical data and contains the mapping scheme of the data. In addition categorical encoding is purely a data handling/processing problem so it seems more natural that it would be handled by Pandas. Is there anything in the pipeline to add support for this in the future? Would this require a lot of restructuring of the sklearn API to support?
