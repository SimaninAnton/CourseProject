When trying to execute fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all') while being in Python 3.3 environment I get the following error:
Downloading dataset from http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/20news-bydate.tar.gz (14 MB)

    open(cache_path, 'wb').write(pickle.dumps(cache).encode('zip'))
AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'
The problem is that the value is bytes, and in Python 3 bytes can not be encoded. They can only be decoded.
