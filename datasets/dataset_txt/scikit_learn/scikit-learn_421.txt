Description
The documentation to pass parameters to an estimator through fit is outdated when doing nested cross-validation with GridSearchCV.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
In this issue #2879 they mention it should be passed directly, but in the documentation under the section fit it says it takes a dictionary fit_paramsthat is deprecated.
