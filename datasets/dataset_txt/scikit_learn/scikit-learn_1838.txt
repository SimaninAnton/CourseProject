Hi All,
So I have a classification problem with multiple target categories, i.e., (['axis1', 'axis2', .. etc]). I have used this as target variable when fitting a logistic regression (and a LinearSVM) classifiers. I got quite bad results as some model variations of those two have accuracies below chance!
I only today figured out that I must encode the target as integers (just like the iris dataset example). When I did that, I got way better results. I guess both logistic regression and SVM have the multiclass integers by default, but I did not know. The coefficients of the two cases (label vs. encoded) were different as well (compared using the np.allclose)
Also, I tried the one-hot encoded vector and I (rightfully) got an error message.
Suggestion: I would like sklearn to warn the user that he should be using an encoded target variable instead of labels.
I would like to contribute by a pull request but I am still learning using Github. So if anyone of you would like to fix this, it would be helpful.
Thanks.
