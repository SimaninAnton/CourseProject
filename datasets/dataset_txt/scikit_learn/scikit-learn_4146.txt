Hi all,
If you pass y as a list the next error appears
TypeError: only integer arrays with one element can be converted to an index
The error goes away when you pass y as numpy array however shouldn't this be either taken care of in the code (check whether is numpy array or list) or display a warning. Just saying.
Thanks,
