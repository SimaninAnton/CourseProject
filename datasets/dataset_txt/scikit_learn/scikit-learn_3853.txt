Currently the check_estimator function requires that users raise a NotFittedError, which is only possible if they inherit from / use the sklearn error.
This breaks the paradigm of users not requiring inheritance for compatibility.
A possible solution would be to check for the parent of NotFittedError (ValueError?) and the message?
