I use extra trees modal for my essay, but here's a problem.
When i call extra trees modal like:
{
'ExtraTrees ': ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=180, max_depth=30,min_samples_split=20,
min_samples_leaf =1,min_weight_fraction_leaf=0,
max_features =None,max_leaf_nodes=None,n_jobs=3 ,
warm_start =True,
bootstrap=None)
'otherclassfiers': otherclassfiers
}
And use a ' for cycle ' to implement classification in k-fold method like ('for cycle' is essential because I want to make comparison between classifiers):
for name, clf in classifiers.items():
scores=[]
for train, test in cv.split(X, y):
classifier = clf
X_train, X_test = X[train], X[test]
y_train, y_test = y[train], y[test]
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
...
I got precision of this method higher than 80%.
But an awkward problem occurred when I directly call classifier like:
classifier = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=180, max_depth=30,min_samples_split=20,
min_samples_leaf =1,min_weight_fraction_leaf=0,
max_features =None,max_leaf_nodes=None,n_jobs=3 ,
warm_start =True,
bootstrap=None)
This time the precision became lower than 50%.
I think the latter result is the write one because I know my data can't reach 80%, I have no idea about the false result of first method of calling Extra-trees modal.
Not such a problem happened to other classifier as I know.
