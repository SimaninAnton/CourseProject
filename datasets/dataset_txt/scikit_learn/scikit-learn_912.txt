Found two issues while going through the docs of SGDClassifier/SGDRegressor:
The last line in the following:
max_iter : int, optional
The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs). It only impacts the behavior in the fit method, and not the partial_fit. Defaults to 5. Defaults to 1000 from 0.21, or if tol is not None.
Defaults to 1000 from 0.21, or if tol is not None.
seems incomplete.
According to the docs, the attribute tol is used in two scenarios, one for early stopping when the loss on the validation data set aside, does not decrease by at least tol for 5 (default) iterations. And the other, when the loss on the training set does not decrease by a value greater than tol. Am I correct about this?
