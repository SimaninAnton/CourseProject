It got stuck for a long while, and all I get as output are:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scikit_learn-0.14.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/sklearn/pls.py:7: DeprecationWarning: This module has been moved to cross_decomposition and will be removed in 0.16
"removed in 0.16", DeprecationWarning)

Thank you!
