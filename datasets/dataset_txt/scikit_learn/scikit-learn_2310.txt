In a recent paper (Moreo Fern√°ndez, A., Esuli, A., & Sebastiani, F. (2016). Lightweight Random Indexing for Polylingual Text Classification. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 57, 151-185.) the authors introduce a new method of random indexing that is useful for polylingual text classification.
A public implementation is available here, but only in Java. Would it be possible to add an implementation to scikit-learn, or are there any objections against it?
