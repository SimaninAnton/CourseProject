A simple case can be found here when manhattan_distances take two sparse matrices as input
https://gist.github.com/4117966
The function fails without complaining.
Seems @jakevdp https://github.com/jakevdp/pyDistances/ has many very efficient routines for computing pairwise-distances for sparse matrices, any plan for adopting some of them to sklearn?
