I'm using sklearn/0.15.2, Django/1.7.1, and Apache/2.4.7 on Ubuntu 14.04. I run several Django sites and I server them with Apache via mod_wsgi. Importing an sklearn submodule (e.g. import sklearn.preprocessing) results in pages failing to load when it is served via Apache. This only happens to the pages where an sklearn submodule is imported. Sometimes, a page does load, even though the module is imported, but that happens very rarely. When a page fails to load, the whole web server stops responding, and I have to reload the web service (service apache2 reload) to make the server respond again. But as soon as a page fails to load because of this issue, the server needs to be reloaded again. Strangely, this behavior does not occur when the site is served via Django's development server.
Could this be an issue with sklearn? Or should I report this problem at Apache instead? What can I do to help debug this further?
