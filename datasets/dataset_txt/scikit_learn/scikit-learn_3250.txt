Having a clearly defined Raises section like we have here across all the functions and classes would be super awesome I feel.
(But this might add quite a lot of lines to our codebase and it is an extra burden to maintain)
If approved by our devs, I feel this could make a nice project for some student to take up pre-gsoc?
If approved, to be tagged "Large Scale" and "Documentation"
