When using a large number of samples, train and test in _fit_and_score and thus memory-mapped within the Parallel loop. I have found out that in this case, train and test can be overlapping, while they are generate by a KFold(3, shuffle=False). I suspect some collisions in joblib there. I discovered this by seeing that some of my scores were unexpectedly low in the grid_scores_ past a specific number of samples.
I will try to reproduce ASAP
