There seem to be two intended entrypoints to NMF: the class NMF and the function non_negative_factorization. The latter is not exported from sklearn.decomposition, but I guess it should be (?).
Also, the function has a parameter regularization that the class doesn't have. In the class, it's hardwired to "both". Is there a reason for that? I actually want to get some sparse components from a dataset; I don't care what the reduced samples look like. The NMF class doesn't let me do that, while the old PG solver did with its sparseness parameter.
