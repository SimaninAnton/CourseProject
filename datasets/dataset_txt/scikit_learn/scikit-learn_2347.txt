I find the documentation on f-regression feature selection very obscure, and would suggest the following:
make it clear that the f-regression feature selection is just a univariate linear model, where features are ranked accordingly to the significance of the regression parameter. This is actually equivalent to ranking features according to their correlation with the target variable.
make it clear that this is not an iterative procedure to include features (ie not what is described here: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204141/difference-between-selecting-features-based-on-f-regression-and-based-on-r2).
maybe mentionned that this is akin to sure independence screening? http://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/papers/06/SIS.pdf
Note that all of this may be trivial for anyone more familiar with the feature selection literature.
