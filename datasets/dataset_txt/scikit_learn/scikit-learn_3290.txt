According to the documentation, the algorithm to compute fractional power of matrices is based on
Nicholas J. Higham and Lijing lin (2011) “A Schur-Pade Algorithm for Fractional Powers of a Matrix.” SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 32 (3). pp. 1056-1078. ISSN 0895-4798
The same authors have published an improved algorithm which is more accurate and more efficient in:
