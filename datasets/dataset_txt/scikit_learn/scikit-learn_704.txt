This issue is to suggest a new option to the SimpleImputer(): For the missing values in a given column A_j, one could replace by random draws from the present value from that same column j. In comparison to the existing imputation strategies in SimpleImputer(), such "informed" approach does i) preserve some of the randomness that is present in the column instead of replacing by a constant and ii) the filled-in values reflect the distribution of the values really existing in that column.
