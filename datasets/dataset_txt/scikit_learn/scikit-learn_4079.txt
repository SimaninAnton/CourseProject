Currently plotting the decision boundaries, clusters etc have to be done manually...
I feel we could benefit from a plotting framework ( or Mixin perhaps? ) to provide an easy interface for plots etc?
As an example in clustering modules, there could be a method plot_clusters to plot and color the clusters according the the current fit configuration... similarly score values / probabilities / could be plotted?
