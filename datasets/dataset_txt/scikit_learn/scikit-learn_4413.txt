Hi all,
I was wondering if there was a way to put in the variable/feature cost in building decision trees.
As described in the rpart manual:" cost is a vector of non-negative costs, one for each variable in the model. Defaults to one for all variables. These are scalings to be applied when considering splits, so the improvement on splitting on a variable is divided by its cost in deciding which split to choose."
I am fairly inept at coding well in python so if you have any ideas about how to implement this, I would more than welcome the help.
Cheers,
