There are several issues with AffinityPropagtion.
First, the easy ones:
affinity_propagation doesn't document convit and max_iter.
I don't think convit does what the AffinityPropagation docstring says it does.
Setting max_iter to 10 in the plot_cluster_comparison.py example yields a label of `-2147483648`` for all data points
The hard one:
it is way to slow. I'm not sure there is any good way to speed it up. :-/
