I came across a weird issue while cross validating my lightgbm model using a TimeSeriesSplit cv.
Following is the sample code:
model1 = LGBMClassifier(random_state=7)
scores1 = cross_val_score(model1, X, y, cv=TimeSeriesSplit(5), scoring='roc_auc')
model2 = LGBMClassifier(random_state=7)
scores2 = cross_val_score(model2, X, y, cv=TimeSeriesSplit(5), scoring='roc_auc', n_jobs=-1)
Here scores1.mean() is not equal to scores2.mean(). How is this possible? Is it that when n_jobs is None, it is uses warm_state to be True for subsequent TimeSeriesSplit folds and when n_jobs = -1, it has to train all models parallel and hence cannot reuse the parameters of previous split folds?
