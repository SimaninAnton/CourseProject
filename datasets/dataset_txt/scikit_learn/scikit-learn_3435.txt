In its current form, scikit-learn's implementation of isotonic regression only fits functions of one variable. I have written a multidimensional analog; would there be any interest in incorporating it into scikit-learn?
My implementation relies on the python interface to the igraph library, in case that poses a problem.
Background on multidimensional isotonic regression:
In the multidimensional case, a complete ordering is no longer generally possible, but points may still be partially ordered: If all of the coordinates of the first point are less than or equal to the coordinates of the second point, then the first point can be deemed less than or equal to the second. For example, in two dimensions, the points (1,3) and (2,2) are not ordered, but the point (1,3) is less than the point (2,4), which is less than the point (2,5). A multidimensional isotonic function is guaranteed to yield values that are nondecreasing when evaluated at a series of nondecreasing points; for example, f(1,3) <= f(2,4) <= f(2,5).
A multidimensional isotonic regression takes a set of multidimensional points X, with corresponding values y, and returns an isotonic function with minimum squared distance from y. Algorithmically, this turns out to be mappable to a network flow problem (see e.g. Spouge, Wan, and Wilbur 2003).
Apologies if this is not the appropriate place to pose this question.
