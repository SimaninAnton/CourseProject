hamming_loss only uses labels in the case where the input is multilabel. Then, it only uses the number of labels, which is identical to y_true.shape[1]. So it's completely unnecessary.
I think we should either:
deprecate and remove it. (My preference)
allow it to specify a subset of labels to evaluate over, and note that it is only used in the multilabel case
