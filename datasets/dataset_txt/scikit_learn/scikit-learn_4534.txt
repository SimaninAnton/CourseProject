Theoretically, there's no reason why Isomap can't operate on an abitrary graph, but the existing implementation assumes a k-nearest neighbor graph.
Adding an option for using a precomputed graph would match the API for SpectralEmbedding, which can accept a precomputed affinity matrix in addition to using standard methods for its construction.
