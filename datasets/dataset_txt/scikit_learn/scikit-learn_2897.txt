clf = MLPRegressor(algorithm='l-bfgs', alpha=1e-5, hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 100, 50, 50))
#model_nn =  clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
SelectFromModel(clf, threshold=0.25, prefit=True).transform(X_train) 
ValueError: The underlying estimator MLPRegressor has no coef_orfeature_importances_ attribute. Either pass a fitted estimator to SelectFromModel or call fit before calling transform.
Which makes sense as MLPRegressor only has the attribute coefs_ representing the weight of each layer, but no attribute for the weight of each feature.
