Hi,
i am using the Anaconda 2.3.0
Is it me or the scikit-learn modules model_selection and gaussian_process are not in it ?
I changed the module name to cross_validation to use the train_test_split method.
Ibid for GridSearchCV in exercise_02_sentiment.
Please let me know what i did wrong.
Best regards,
CL.
