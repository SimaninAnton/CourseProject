It says
"In the multi-class and multi-label case, this is the weighted average of the F1 score of each class."
at the very top.
That is quite simplifying and only somewhat true, depending on the average parameter.
It's definitely not the default behavior if doing multi-class, which currently is to report only the label with number 1 (#8737).
I think we should be more explicit here.
