I need anisotropic correlation function for my GaussianProcess.
How can I put the correlation parameter "theta" (as a vector) as an input of sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcess function ?
In original dacefit package in MATLAB, I could have theta as a vector; however, here in sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcess I couldn't make my model with multidimensional theta parameter.
Please let me know how I can generate an anisotropic for my Gaussian process?
Thanks
