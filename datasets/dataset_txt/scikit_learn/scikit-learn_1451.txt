Description
Instantiating RandomizedSearchCV with n_iter greater than the size of param_distributions (i.e. the product of the length of each distribution/array in the grid) will fail with an exception at this line. This is a bit annoying for me because I have an app where I'm letting the user specify the number of iterations to run from the command line, also I've been fiddling around with the param grid so grid_size keeps changing. I don't want to have to work out the exact grid size when it goes below, say, 50; if I specify --n-iter 50 that should be interpreted as an upper bound on the number of iterations.
Would it be possible to add an option (off by default) to the constructor specifying whether to throw in such cases? e.g. By passing allow_smaller_grid=True (the option would default to False)
