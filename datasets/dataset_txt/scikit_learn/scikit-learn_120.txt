 Sb = St - Sw  # between scatter 
To my understanding, Sb should reflect a sum of covariances of (m-m_i) vectors, where m is the centroid and m_i is the mean of class i. I believe the current implementation uses a slightly different algorithm than what I know from the literature: which relies on eigenvalues and vectors of
S_t * inverse(S_w).
