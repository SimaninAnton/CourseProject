Could you please test NumPy 1.7.1rc1, which was just released:
http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2013-March/065948.html
and check that it fixes #1715. If possible, please also report any other issues that you encounter. I want to personally make sure that the release is ok this time with scikit-learn and my apologies for the memory bug in 1.7.0.
