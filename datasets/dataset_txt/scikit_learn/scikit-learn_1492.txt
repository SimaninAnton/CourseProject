Hello! Currently new in machine learning. I need a svm classifier in order to classify the 2 seagrass species present in our seagrass picture. Can I use this repo for that? Can I build my own dataset using this repo? Thank you! I'm a graduating undergrad ECE student that still fighting for our graduation. Hope anyone can help me.
