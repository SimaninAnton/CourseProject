I follow this link to download the dev version of sklearn and then build and install it. The process is OK.
But when I try from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier and got import error. Later, I found that, in my /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ directory, there are two dirs which is related with skearn: scikt_learn-0.13-py2.7-linux-i386.egg/ and sklearn/, and another file scikit_learn-0.14_git.egg-info.
I print out sys.path and didn't find /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/ in the list. Is this a installation bug and how can I use the dev version of skearn?
