To the best of my knowledge, the tree-based ensemble classifiers don't maintain a record of the OOB scores during the training phase (correct me if I'm wrong).
I would find this a useful feature since it would allow me to easily examine the number of trees (n_estimators) at which the OOB score stabilises e.g. the error_rate vs. n_estimators chart --

Related: this feature is activated in the randomForest R package by setting randomForest(..., do.trace=True,..) when instantiating the classifier.
Thanks.
