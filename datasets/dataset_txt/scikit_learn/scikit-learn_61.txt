i know how important it is to keep the scope of sklearn reasonable.
nonetheless, i have the following question that i thought would be useful to have documented on the issues, and i can't find it:
according to the leading ML conferences and journals, hypothesis testing is a form of machine learning.
but it is not currently in sklearn.
are there any plans to include testing, or is it outside the domain of what sklearn will do
(much like multiview learning).
thanks
