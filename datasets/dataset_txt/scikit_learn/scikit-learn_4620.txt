I just noticed that using fast_dot has some effects that I didn't know about. np.dot is happy to multiply matrices where one size is 0. fast_dot will fail in this case.
I had a case where I applied KMeans.predict to an array that might contain 0 samples. That failed with the new code.
This feels a little bit like a regression as it might break other peoples code. And producing empty masks can happen very easily.
