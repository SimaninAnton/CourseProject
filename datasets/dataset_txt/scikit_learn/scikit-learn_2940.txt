Hi all,
I'm having an issue with importing mutual_info_classif and mutual_info_regression.
Versions:
Python: 2.7.10
sklearn: .17.1
I have also checked that the package is installed at the correct location and I am able to import other functions in sklearn.feature_selection. I have also been using sklearn smoothly up until this point
Thanks!
Actual Results
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif
Traceback (most recent call last):
Python Shell, prompt 2, line 1
ImportError: cannot import name mutual_info_classif
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression
Traceback (most recent call last):
Python Shell, prompt 3, line 1
ImportError: cannot import name mutual_info_regression
