I think we should add an example on t-sne perplexity. Tuning it can be really important.
See http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/
We should see if there is a good example using any of our standard datasets. Maybe lfw?
I played around with the "water treatment plant" from UCI which was quite interesting, though I'm not sure we can get that from mldata.
We can also use a higher-dim synthetic example as in the blog-post above.
