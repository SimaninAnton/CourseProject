The _gradient_descent function always uses the default value of 50 for this, no matter what you set it to be. This is bad, especially if you want t-SNE to run for a fixed number of iterations.
It can be fixed by changing the _tsnefunction as follows:
    opt_args = {"n_iter": 50, "momentum": 0.5, "it": 0,
                "learning_rate": self.learning_rate,
                "n_iter_without_progress": self.n_iter_without_progress, # FIXME: this was missing
                "verbose": self.verbose, "n_iter_check": 25,
                "kwargs": dict(skip_num_points=skip_num_points)}
