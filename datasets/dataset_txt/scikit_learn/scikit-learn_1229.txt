We're using behavior in Ridge that's currently deprecated in scipy:
scipy.sparse.linalg.cg called without specifying `atol`. The default value will be changed in a future release. For compatibility, specify a value for `atol` explicitly, e.g., ``cg(..., atol=0)``, or to retain the old behavior ``cg(..., atol='legacy')`
Not sure if this should be blocking for the release?
