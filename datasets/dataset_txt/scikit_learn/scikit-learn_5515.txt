Long story, but I kept getting errors on the AWS MapReduce cluster saying the jobs failed... right starting today...
And the error message I got from the console was this
univariate_selection.py:92: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide   f = msb / msw
This doesn't happen every time... I guess it's because I was randomly sampling the data...
Also, something strange is that this only happens on the cluster (debian lenny, I manually installed python2.7.2 from source, and numpy 1.6.1, scipy.0.10.0, and the latest source from the trunk for scikit-learn), and I haven't been able to reproduce this on my dev machine (i.e., Mac Lion, used fink to install python and other dependencies...)
What could be the issue?
Thanks,
Jiang
