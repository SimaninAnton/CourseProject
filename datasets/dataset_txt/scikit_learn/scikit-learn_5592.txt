Apparently you need to manually do
from scikits.learn.svm import libsvm libsvm.set_verbosity_wrap(1)
to get verbose output from libsvm. This issue was raised on IRC by an user, who pointed out that verbose output is very useful for methods that might converge slowly.
Furthermore there is no equivalent in the liblinear binding.
SVMs should have a verbose parameter.
