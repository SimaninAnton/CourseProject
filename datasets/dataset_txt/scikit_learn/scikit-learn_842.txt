Description
Cannot pickle a CountVectorizer using the builtin python pickle module, likely due to the use of lambdas in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Example:
import pickle
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
raw_texts = ["this is a text", "oh look, here's another", "including my full model vocab is...well, a lot"]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_features=20000, token_pattern=r"\b\w+\b")
vectorizer.fit(raw_texts)
tokenizer = vectorizer.build_tokenizer()
output_file = 'foo.pkl'
with open(output_file, 'wb') as out:
    pickle.dump(tokenizer, out)
with open(output_file, 'rb') as infile:
    pickle.load(infile)
Expected Results
Program runs without error
Actual Results
Traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tst.py", line 14, in <module>
    pickle.dump(tokenizer, out)
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'VectorizerMixin.build_tokenizer.<locals>.<lambda>'
Workaround:
Instead of the builtin pickle, use cloudpickle, which can capture the lambda expression.

Similar Issues
I think this is similar to issues:
#10807
#9467 (looking at the stackoverflow thread at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25348532/can-python-pickle-lambda-functions/25353243#25353243 , it suggests using dill which also seems to work for the toy example)
Proposed fix
Naively, I would make one of the two changes below, but I am not familiar with the scikit-learn codebase, so they might not be appropriate:
Update the FAQ to direct people to other serialization libraries (perhaps I missed this recommendation?), e.g. cloudpickle at https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle or dill
Remove the use of the lambdas in the vectorizer and replace them with locally def'd functions. I suspect that this solution is flawed because it doesn't account for other uses of lambdas elsewhere in the codebase, and the only complete solution would be to stop using lambdas, but these are a useful language feature.
