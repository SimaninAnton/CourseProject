I feel there is a whitening transform missing. It seems every algorithm implements it again.
Also I think not all algorithms have it.
Thing that should be possible to do are:
Component-wise zero mean, unit variance
ZCA whitening transform (PCA, with "whitening" option, then transform back)
The PCA with "whiten" option definitely also belongs there, so I might put this transform in the same place.
