Some scorers (the ones derived from the confusion matrix: recall_macro, precision_macro, etc.) are defined with functools.partial. Partial functions have no __name__ which creates problems:
>>> from sklearn.metrics.scorer import get_scorer
>>> recall_macro = get_scorer('recall_macro')
>>> recall_macro

AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'
The __name__ attribute can be set after creating the partial function. If I'm correct, the most correct option would be to use the name of the original function (metric.__name__).
