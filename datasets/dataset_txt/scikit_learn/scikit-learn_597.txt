Description
For KMeans, there is a predict method: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans.predict
However, for DBSCAN there isn't, although there are fit and fit_predict methods.
Would a separate predict method be of any use to the community? If so, I can submit a pull request.
