For .14 release (aka urgent):
Add a link to the citation page on the front page (say next to the donate button)
Make a carousel with a few more examples on the front page
Later:
Display some sponsors on the front page.
Clean up the examples page that has a lot of embedded css that should be fixed by giving proper css class to elements (rst has a directive, 'class' I believe, to do that)
[ ] Make the blue next/previous buttons not sliding and fixed at the bottom of the page
