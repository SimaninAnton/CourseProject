Hi, I want to add a module for K Means clustering with custom distance function at sklearn/cluster. It will have a class called CustomKMeans. This class will take a distance_function as argument in its __init__. The end user will need to define a distance function and use it in this way:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import CustomKMeans
def custom_dist_func(x1, x2):
    ##distance function here
    return dist
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]])
kmeans = CustomKMeans(n_clusters = 2, distance_function = custom_dist_func).fit(X)
print(kmeans.labels_, kmeans.cluster_centers_)
The API will be similar to KMeans except for the distance function part. We can have Euclidean distance as the default distance function or we can throw a Distance Function Not Defined exception.
Will this module be useful in any way or good-to-have in the library?
