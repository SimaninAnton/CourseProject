sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion currently does some custom validation of the provided estimators, and requires them to have a transform method.
This validation would fail for scikit-learn compatible estimators that implement predict and not transform methods. In particular, this is currently the case for xgboost.XGBClassifier (v0.4 to v0.6).
Also e.g. in LogisticRegression and many others, the transform method is deprecated, so it probably shouldn't be used for validation.
Using a more standard estimators validation through sklearn.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator (or a subset of those) might be more suitable.
Tested with v0.18rc2
