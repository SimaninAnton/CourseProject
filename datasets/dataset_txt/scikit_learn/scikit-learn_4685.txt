Hi, I didn't get to track it down any more than to find that this list comprehension:
quotes = [finance.quotes_historical_yahoo(symbol, d1, d2, asobject=True)
          for symbol in symbols]
throws HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found. Getting rid of the 'NWS': 'News Corp' entry in symbol_dict resolves the issue.
