The contributor's guide recommends using the deprecated decorator for attributes as follows:
    @property
    @deprecated("Attribute labels_ was deprecated in version 0.13 and "
                "will be removed in 0.15. Use 'classes_' instead")
    def labels_(self):
        return self.classes_
However the warning produced begins "Function labels_ is deprecated; Attribute labels_ was deprecated ...". This is ugly. It should just say "Attribute labels_ is deprecated; ...".
We should either:
remove the boilerplate "Function x is deprecated" as I think we're not counting on it being there in our deprecation messages elsewhere
handle explicitly the case where deprecated decorates a property
(No doubt futurepast aspires to do all of this right.)
