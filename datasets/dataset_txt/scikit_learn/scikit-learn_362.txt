We use lexicographic ordering when categories='auto' which is the default.
I think we should deprecate this behavior and force the user to specify the order of the categories when they are strings. Since the OrdinalEncoder is used in a context where order matters, lexicographic order doesn't make sense in general.
(This isn't an issue with e.g. OneHotEncoder where there is no order).
