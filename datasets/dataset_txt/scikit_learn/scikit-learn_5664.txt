The following sentence
SVMs perform classification as a function of some subset of the training data, called the support vectors. These vectors can be accessed in member support_:
seems to be intended to obtain support vectors. So, the term "support_" should be "support_vectors_"
The subsequent example is also supposed to be:
>>> clf.support_vectors_
array([[ 0., 0.],
[ 1., 1.]])
