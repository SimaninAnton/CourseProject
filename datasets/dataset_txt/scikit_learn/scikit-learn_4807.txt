The file _tree.pxd is required for extending the Tree class using 3rd party cython. I am using
cimport sklearn.tree._tree
but that fails if this file is unavailable.
It should be installed with the other sklearn files. My current work around:
sudo cp /home/tim/dev/sklearn/sklearn/tree/_tree.pxd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/tree
