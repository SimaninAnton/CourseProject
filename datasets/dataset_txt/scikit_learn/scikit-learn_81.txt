Description
Python 3.6.9
scikit-learn 0.22
16 CPUs, 256 GB RAM
There are about 50 different classes within the data.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
[code]
estimators = [
('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=lambda string: string.split())),
('clf', SGDClassifier(n_jobs=-1, early_stopping=True, class_weight='balanced'))
]
p = Pipeline(estimators)
p.fit(x_train_y_train)
Expected Results
The training procedure is parallelized by creating multiple processes, so that the full CPU capacity is used.
Actual Results
In total, there are 16 CPUs. However, there is only one CPU used, so that less than 10% of the total CPU power is used.
