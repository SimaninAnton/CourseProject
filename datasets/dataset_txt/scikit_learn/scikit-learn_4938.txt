Sparse random projections seem to make more sense for randomized PCA since the main point is to deal with large matrices and it is easy to get to the point where the Gaussian projection matrix becomes to large for ram. It looks like it should be easy to change utils.extmath.randomized_svd to use sparse random projections. Is there any reason not to do this? If I do it for my own use should I submit it?
