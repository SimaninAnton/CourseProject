When handling inhomogeneous data, such as the lines of a set of a documents, each document should have a different normalization ratio for its lines. This means that the data should be handled in batches, with each batch being normalized in a different way. In the present pipeline.Pipeline fit() method does not seem to support such implementation, forcing me to separate the features extraction process from the pipeline including features preprocessing and classification. I do not know if this is feasible, but it would be a nice addition...
