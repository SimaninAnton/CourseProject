My questions are specific to https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.PCA.
I don't understand why you square eigenvalues
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/55bf5d9/sklearn/decomposition/pca.py#L444
here?
Also, explained_variance is not computed for new transformed data other than original data used to compute eigen-vectors. Is that not normally done?
Explained variance can be also computed by taking the variance of each axis in the transformed space and diving by the total variance. Any reason that is not done here?
