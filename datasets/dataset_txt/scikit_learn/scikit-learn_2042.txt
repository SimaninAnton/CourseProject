Some tests of SGDClassifier (and maybe SGDRegressor) are currently showing
 FutureWarning: max_iter and tol parameters have been added in <class 'sklearn.linear_model.stochastic_gradient.SGDClassifier'> in 0.19. If both are left unset, they default to max_iter=5 and tol=None. If tol is not None, max_iter defaults to max_iter=1000. From 0.21, default max_iter will be 1000, and default tol will be 1e-3.
If these are expected, we should catch them.
