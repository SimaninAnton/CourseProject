The first KDTree example in the documentation is as follows:
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.random((10, 3))  # 10 points in 3 dimensions
tree = KDTree(X, leaf_size=2)              
dist, ind = tree.query(X[0], k=3)                
The tree.query function raises the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi", line 1295, in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.BinaryTree.query (sklearn/neighbors/kd_tree.c:10451)
ValueError: query data dimension must match training data dimension
Can someone update the documentation to call the tree.query function without raising the error? Thanks!
