Hi guys,
Due to the model_selection refactor, there are a lot of dead links out there. Would it be an option to redirect the old pages such as
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html
to
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html
I know you're using an automated doc generator, so I can imagine this to be a bit a ball ache. But as an end user, I'm sure that this would be much appreciated.
Thanks!
