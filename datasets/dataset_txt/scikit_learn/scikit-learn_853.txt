In light of the recent and previous incidents (#11550, #12782) where a maintainer logs into circle-ci and accidentally adds a deployment key to the sklearn's repo (resulting in circle-ci deploy step failing), I think it makes sense to have a section in the maintainer.rst and guide a newcomer like me on how to setup their accounts with the related platforms such as travis, circle-ci, etc.
Right now I'm trying to login to travis, and it's asking for some permissions and now I'm too scared to hit "Authorize travis-ci" button, and couldn't find any relevant info in the docs.
I'm happy to put a PR together after hearing your experiences on each of those platforms we use (and THEN setup my account in them).
