While trying to push some stuff to my remote I have managed to push all debian tags into the primary scikit-learn repository. I have later removed all debian/ tags to clean up after myself ;) Sorry about that. If you feel like I better do not have push privileges, that would be just fine with me, feel free to revoke.
