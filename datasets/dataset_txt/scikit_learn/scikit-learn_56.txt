     random_state : int, RandomState instance 
This is a private function, so it's maybe not a big deal, but I wanted to point out that the parameter random_state to _k_init() must be a RandomState instance, it can not be an integer. So, the documentation of this parameter is wrong on the docstrings of _k_init().
