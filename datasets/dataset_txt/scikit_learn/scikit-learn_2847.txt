Description
A figure image in this article (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#partial-dependence) has been lost.
According to the source code (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.github.io/blob/master/0.17/modules/ensemble.html), there should exists a "images" dir under the "auto_examples/ensemble" dir and contain the lost image (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.github.io/tree/master/0.17/auto_examples/ensemble).
