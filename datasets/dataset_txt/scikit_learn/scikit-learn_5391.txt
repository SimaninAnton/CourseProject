In a test run of a classification system I've set up I run the whole thing through on a test dataset that has only 20 examples.
When I do feature selection using the randomized lasso, I get an error -- the traceback is here. Any ideas what might be causing this problem? It doesn't seem to occur if I run the randomized lasso with more data.
