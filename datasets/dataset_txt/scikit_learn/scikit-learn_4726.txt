Here are a list of things we need to change in the website:
the design is slow to load, hence it resizes it automatically after loading
the top menu needs to be rewritten completely to avoid alignment problem (see ogrisel's computer)
Fork me on github not working.
Disable the github fork ribbon on small (mobile) screens
Sidebar should collapse automatically on very small screens.
Check that we are using the asynchronous syntax for the Google Analytics tracker: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/?hl=fr
