examples/gaussian_process/plot_gpr_co2.py relies on a dataset that we used to fetch from mldata.org. Now we download it from its original source, but that server may not be reliable, etc. We also process only the monthly averages from a weekly reading.
We should have this data on openml. I don't know whether we should try to replicate the form it was in on mldata, or create something new.
