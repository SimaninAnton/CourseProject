This example seems to rely on the ordering of items in a dict, which is not defined by Python, when determining the axes on a plot of grid scores. See SO question about this topic.
We either need to change the example, or specify that the ordering of keys in the parameter grid determines the ordering of items in grid_scores_. The latter requires no additional code.
