The splitter attribute in the constructor of DecisionTreeClassifier(or DecisionTreeRegressor) can take two values 'best' or 'random'. The docs say
Supported strategies are “best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split.
What does setting 'random' do? Does it make the tree finds the best split at each node with randomly selected thresholds among the randomly sampled max_features features? Or does it select a feature at random among the max_features randomly sampled features and finds the best split for this feature?
