After fitting a PCA model, we reconstruct the test samples as X_rec=pca.inverse_transform(pca.transform(X_test)) that is the combination of components, e.g. a1c1+a2c2 + mean. But sometimes, we only want to get the coordinates of X_rec, that is the coefficients on the components (a1, a2). Do we have such api?
