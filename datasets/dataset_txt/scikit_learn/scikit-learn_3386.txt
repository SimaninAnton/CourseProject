Many have been confused about whether the score represents the model's accuracy or its error, examples in issue 'Meaning of oob_score_ in RandomForestClassifier #5838' and Stack overflow post here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31438476/parameter-oob-score-in-scikit-learn-equals-accuracy-or-error.
I propose a slight change to the documentation to remove the ambiguity, and will work on it myself now.
