I would be interested in using Density Forests (eg chapter 5 of http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=155552) in scikit-learn.
Discussed this a bit with @glouppe and concluded we should open an issue. Right now I am wondering if this passes the bar of "used widely" and "of general interest" for inclusion
Most of it would be replacing the splitter/criterion used to grow the trees. However you also need access to more than just one value per leaf. Instead you need the means and covariance matrix in each leaf to parametrise a gaussian pdf.
