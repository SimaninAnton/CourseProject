Description
As suggested by @jmargeta in the discussion of PR #10527 (see this comment), the image used in the examples is not really well suited to demonstrate segmenting of an image via graph clustering. As there are no regions separated by crisp borders, the results are not especially instructive. If #10527 is merged, one could change the image to one of the images in scikit-image's library (I'd suggest skimage.data.coins()).
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Run examples/cluster/plot_face_segmentation.py or examples/cluster/plot_face_ward_segmentation.py
