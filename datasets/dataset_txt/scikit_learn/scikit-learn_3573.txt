There seems to be a problem with LDA when ones wants to use shrinkage='auto'. This was not happening a few months ago. The following error is returned, and the timing seems to match the modifications performed in commit a8970fc and/or 1d98ca3 in #5092:
NotImplementedError Traceback (most recent call last)
in ()
4 y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])
5 clf = LDA(shrinkage='auto')
----> 6 clf.fit(X, y)

427 elif self.solver == 'lsqr':
NotImplementedError: shrinkage not supported
