FastICA uses print to tell a user about that the number of components is larger than the number of available features (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/51a765a/sklearn/decomposition/fastica_.py#L296). This makes it unnecessarily hard to catch the output and redirect it to a logger.
I propose to use warnings.warn, as in kernel approximation or qda.
