There are some consistency issues in the mixtures module.
The covariance matrices in VBGMM and DPGMM are called precision and covars in GMM for example.
There is also a _get_covars function in GMM, that actually seems pretty helpful: it provides the full covariance matrices independent of the covariance type. But I find the docstring misleading and it is privat, so it is not visible in the online docs and to autocompletion.
