Here is my testing code, The output from the function predict_proba is only 1 and 0, and no probability could be found.
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=10,compute_importances=True)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
Z = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
The output of Z is:
array([[ 1., 0.],
[ 1., 0.],
[ 1., 0.],
[ 1., 0.],
[ 1., 0.],
[ 1., 0.],
]
btw, the version is '0.12.1'
