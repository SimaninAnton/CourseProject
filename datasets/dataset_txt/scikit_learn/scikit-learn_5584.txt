n_samples is used as the number of samples in X for the fit method in classifiers. This is fine and consistently used. However it is also used in the predict() functions as the number of 'test' instances in Y (see SVM for example). This is despite the fact that the size does not need to be the same as that used for the fit() function.
Would a different name be better, to make it obvious that these two shapes can be different?
