Description
The current list of attributes for ARDRegression in the docs mentions coef_, alpha_, lambda_, sigma_ and scores_ but not intercept_ which it should.
Adding
intercept_ : float
        Independent term in decision function. Set to 0.0 if
        ``fit_intercept = False``.
as elsewhere should do the trick
