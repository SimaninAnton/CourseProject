Just found that scikit-learn iris dataset is different from R's MASS datasets package.
I've found it in this Stats Exchange answer, which refers to here which, in turn, says
This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ).
The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature.
The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.
Note that the data in UCI repo and from scikit dataset is the same at cited lines.
Comparing iris data between the 3 sources, we have the following (bolds are differences)
row # source sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width
35 sklearn 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1
Fisher 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.2
R MASS 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.2
38 sklearn 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1
Fisher 4.9 3.6 1.4 0.1
R MASS 4.9 3.6 1.4 0.1
Fisher data

R data
Proposal
If it's a bug, make iris dataset from scikit equal to the others, explain why the difference otherwise. I would guess it's the former.
