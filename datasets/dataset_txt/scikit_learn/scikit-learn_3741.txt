Maybe it is getting too much, but I think it would be interesting to add a non-isotropic gaussian example to the cluster comparison, something like
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

X, y = make_blobs(random_state=170, n_samples=600)
rng = np.random.RandomState(74)

transformation = rng.normal(size=(2, 2))
X = np.dot(X, transformation)

y_pred = KMeans(n_clusters=3).fit_predict(X)

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_pred)
