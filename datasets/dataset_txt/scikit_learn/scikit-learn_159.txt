Hello,
The other day I had to find the conditional distributions for a Gaussian Mixture Model - the code and maths is here:
https://github.com/plgreenLIRU/GMM_Conditional
I don't think that sklearn's GMM has this feature? If it looks useful, I'd be happy to fork and try to integrate? First time contributor so might be a bit slow :)
