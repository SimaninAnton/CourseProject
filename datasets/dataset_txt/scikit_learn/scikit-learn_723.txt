Hi Everyone, could you kindly help me decide whether I'm hitting a bug or the problem may be in my implementation?
I have a data set with 5 features and 2000+ observations and I use SVR to do regression tests and select parameters with grid search. If I don't scale my data, then I get a best score of close to zero, but if I do scale it, the best score is around 0.90.
When I manually test the data, it predicts wrong values totally randomly. How can this be? I expect the best score to show how well the trained data could have been validated on new ones during cross validation. I suppose I should not get high score if my model cannot generate well. Should I? Could this be a bug?
SKlearn version is 0.19.1 (from package of Ubuntu Linux 18.04 x64 LTS platform)
Python version is 3.6.7
Would it be worth an upgrade with pip? Any further idea? Thank you.
