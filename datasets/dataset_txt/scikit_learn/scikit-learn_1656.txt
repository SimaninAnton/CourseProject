Description
Library code error on the fit method of LinearDiscriminantAnalysis. The code, in my opinion should be as it is in https://github.com/jomicobasi/scikit-learn/tree/attempt-lda
You must understand that LDA and Fisher LDA are used in different situations. FIsher LDA is a binary classifier, whereas LDA is a supervised dimension reduction algorithm. As so, it will be n_components and the number of columns of the data, X.shape[1], that will influence the dimensionality of the data and NOT the number of labels.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis

iris = datasets.load_iris()

X = iris.data
y = iris.target

lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=3)
X_r2 = lda.fit(X, y).transform(X)

print X_r2.shape
Expected Results
(150L, 3L)
Actual Results
(150L, 2L)
