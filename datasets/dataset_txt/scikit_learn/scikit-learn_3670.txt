Sorry if this is not the right place to ask, but I can`t find a contact email for the sklearn team.
My question is is there a paper or scientific source where the agglomerative hierarchical clustering with connectivity constraints is from? I am currently using that algorithm and would like to cite it properly and also study it in more depth.
Any pointer is appreciated.
