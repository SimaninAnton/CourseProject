@jnothman I'm throwing a note here on another potential regression:
As I was trying to get my code to work with 0.19, I had to make a couple changes to my code that generally looked like this:
the self.steps in the Pipeline class can't be a tuple or it runs into a ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. might want to convert it to a list in the __init__? I think this worked worked before but its not a huge deal
if the input isn't a numpy array it seems like it runs into an issue during cross_val_predict. probably needs to be wrapped in an np.array
File "/Users/johria/.virtualenvs/clavis/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py", line 733, in _fit_and_predict
    predictions_ = np.zeros((X_test.shape[0], n_classes))
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'
