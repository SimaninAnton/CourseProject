The docstring of sklearn.utils.random.sample_without_replacement currently reads
    method : "auto", "tracking_selection" or "reservoir_sampling"
        If method == "auto", an algorithm is automatically selected.
        The subset of selected integer is not randomized.

        If method =="tracking_selection", a set based implementation is used
        which is suitable for `n_samples` <<< `n_population`.

        If method == "reservoir_sampling", a reservoir sampling algorithm is
        used which is suitable for high memory constraint or when
        O(`n_samples`) ~ O(`n_population`).
        The subset of selected integer is not randomized.

        If method == "pool", a pool based algorithm is particularly fast, even
        faster than the tracking selection method. Hovewer, a vector containing
        the entire population has to be initialized.
        If n_samples ~ n_population, the reservoir sampling method is faster.
At least the list of methods should be updated, but it would also be nice to explain more clearly what "the subset of selected integer[s] is not randomized" is supposed to mean.
