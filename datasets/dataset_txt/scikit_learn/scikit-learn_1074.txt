In the docstring of the OneHotEncoder we have the following description:
The input to this transformer should be a matrix of integers, denoting
the values taken on by categorical (discrete) features. The output will be
a sparse matrix where each column corresponds to one possible value of one
feature. It is assumed that input features take on values in the range
[0, n_values).
However for fit and fit_transform the description for the input X only contains:
X : array-like, shape [n_samples, n_feature]
  Input array of type int.
I think the description of X should be clearer in fit and fit_transform to say that the integers should be positive and taking values in the range [0, n_values).
