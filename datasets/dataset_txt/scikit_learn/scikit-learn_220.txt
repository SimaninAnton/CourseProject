Is there a reason why the FeatureUnion method signature fit_transform accepts fit_args but neither fit nor transform do? It seems to go against the pattern that fit_transform() is the same as calling fit().transform()?

I see there's been discussion on supporting fit_args but it's not clear if this is resolved. My case is I'm trying to migrage code I wrote a while back where I used a Pipeline and each of my transformers adds columns to a dataframe, to a FeatureUnion where each transform only returns the new columns. One of my transforms takes a third data set in addition to X and y which is used as the transform. I guess as a workaround I'll make it a param of the transform rather than a fit_arg.
