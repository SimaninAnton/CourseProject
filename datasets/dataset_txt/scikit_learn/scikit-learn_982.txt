Description
A deprecation warning is thrown when using sklearn. Recently cloudpickle was updated to do away with this warning, the sklearn version needs to be updated accordingly.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
I imagine this occurs anywhere cloudpickle is imported. I am getting it from:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
and using said Regressor
Expected Results
No deprecation warning should be thrown
Actual Results
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/externals/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py:47: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
