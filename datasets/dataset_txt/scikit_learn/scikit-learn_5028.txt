The plot_sparse_recovery.py example gives off ~10000 warnings of the form
Regressors in active set degenerate. Dropping a regressor, after 136 iterations, i.e. alpha=5.110e-16, with an active set of 20 regressors, and the smallest cholesky pivot element being 3.650e-08^C
It would be nice to do something about that before the release.
cc @GaelVaroquaux @agramfort and @vene, I guess.
