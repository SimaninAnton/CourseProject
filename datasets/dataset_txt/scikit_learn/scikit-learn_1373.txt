currently get_params checks for the existence of the get_params method on the attributes during iteration, however this prevents passing types, which have a get_params methods because they will throw an exception when the method is called - since the object is not instantiated and get_params is not bound. I do not believe there is any negative impact here, unless params are being stored as class level attributes, otherwise a reference to the object is required. To patch this can I add a type exclusion criteria in BaseEstimator.get_params (extending the if deep and hasattr(value, 'get_params') criteria to exclude if isinstance(value, type) ?
