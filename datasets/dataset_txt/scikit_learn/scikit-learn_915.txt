Hi,
suppose that you are using the classical nested cross-validation approach, where the inner loop is for example a grid search that optimize the parameters of a pipeline, and that pipeline also contains a standardization step.
Now, I know that with this approach the validation set (the test set of the inner cv) is correctly standardized by using the scaler fitted with the training set in the same fold. But how to apply the scaler of the best_estimator_ to the test set of the outer cv?
Thanks
