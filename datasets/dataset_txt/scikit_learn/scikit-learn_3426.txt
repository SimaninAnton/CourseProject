Hello,
I apologize in advance if this behavior is because of a mistake I made. I really don't understand this issue.
I'm on Anaconda 2.4.0 (Python 3.4.3) with scikit-learn 0.17 and numpy 1.10.1, I wanted to try the linear discriminant analysis and got this error. (I typed from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis )
Is this related to #5398 ?
