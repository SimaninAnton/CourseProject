Very often, one doesn't care about the pairwise distance matrix but just about the argmin or the argmax along an axis. It would be nice if all distance functions in the pairwise module had argmin / argmax utilities (e.g., euclidean_distances_argmin). This should greatly improve memory consumption.
To benefit from blas acceleration, we can add a chunk_size argument. Then the original distance function can be called one chunk at a time. Another alternative to be really memory efficient is to use Cython but we lose blas acceleration.
