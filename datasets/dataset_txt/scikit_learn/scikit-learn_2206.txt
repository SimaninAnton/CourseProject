If you run the following commands several times
nosetests sklearn/linear_model/
Some tests related to comparing results between two methods fail randomly.
Instead of comparing with each other, maybe we can use the following test case:
x1 x2 y
1 2 0
2 3 0
3 5 1
4 7 0
5 11 1
6 13 1
For this case, I checked in two statistical tools, a professional one, R, and a casual one, google docs, that the result agrees with each other to the digits shown below:
,Coefficients,Standard Error
Intercept,-2.942920409,3.47036
X Variable 1,-0.9491680059,3.97308
X Variable 2,0.9755542466,1.89720
