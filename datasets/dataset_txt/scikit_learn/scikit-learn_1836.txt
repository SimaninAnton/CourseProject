Description
Description of KMeans.inertia_ on http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans is slightly wrong. It says:
Sum of distances of samples to their closest cluster center.
It should say:
Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.
