Currently check_estimator requires that if binary classification is supported, multiclass classification must also be supported. Perhaps this is not a sensible constraint for contrib projects (see scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-contrib#7).
This may be an appropriate subject for tags (#6599). See also #6715.
