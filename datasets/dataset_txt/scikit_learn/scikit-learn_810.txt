Hello,
I use a custom levenshtein distance with DBSCAN using the trick showed here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#how-do-i-deal-with-string-data-or-trees-graphs
dbscan(X, metric=lev_metric, eps=5, min_samples=2, algorithm='brute')
The main problem I'm facing is performance/cost : the time it takes to cluster 13600 points(number of samples of my dataset) is 3 days ! Knowing that for a precomputed distance (euclidean distance), for the same dataset, it takes generally few seconds.
Is there any way to overcome this problem ?
Thanks in advance for your answers
