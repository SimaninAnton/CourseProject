It looks like "char_wb" adds a space before and after each document. That makes sense, and is visible in the docs, but is not explained anywhere as far as I can see.
It's a bit counter-intuitive that it can generate larger vocabularies on toy examples:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
malory = ["Do you want ants?",
          "Because that’s how you get ants."]
cv = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 3), analyzer="char_wb").fit(malory)
print(len(cv.vocabulary_))
74
cv = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 3), analyzer="char").fit(malory)
print(len(cv.vocabulary_))
73
I think we should at least mention this in the user guide, but probably also in the docstring of "analyzer".
