While we're considering additional imputers, I've wondered whether preprocessing is the right place for it. Yes, it is a preprocessing step before other learning, but it often makes use of other supervised and unsupervised learners and hence is a learning task of its own. And preprocessing is getting a bit cramped.
We could also do as with other models and have imputers appear in modules on the basis of how they work rather than function: KNNImputer could appear in neighbors for instance. MICE could appear where..? And the basic Imputer in dummy? probably not.
In practice I think it is more useful for users to import sklearn.impute, akin to our clusterers and decomposition, and unlike our predictors and outlier detectors that are grouped by algorithm.
