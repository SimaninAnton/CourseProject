We should document that SimpleImputer's statistics_ can be nan and will drop features corresponding to the position of the nans:
scikit-learn/sklearn/impute/_base.py
Lines 136 to 139 in 8fe89ea
     Attributes 
     ---------- 
     statistics_ : array of shape (n_features,) 
         The imputation fill value for each feature.
