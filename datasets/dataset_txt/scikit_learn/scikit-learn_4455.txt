There is logistic regression for binary classification and elastic net for regression. While every regression can be used for classification I think it would be great to add L1+L2 regularization for logistic regression (or logistic to Elastic Net) as well. That way, predict_proba() could be used along with other handy tools already implemented for binary classification.
Apologies if this is already present or there's some obvious way to achieve this
