The deprecation of n_iter had an issue as pointed out in #9549.
We could easily find those by adding a test that ensures that everything that's passed to __init__ is actually set as attribute. I'm not sure if we want to enforce that for third party estimators, but if and argument to __init__ is not stored, that probably means set_params is broken.
I might look into this tomorrow
