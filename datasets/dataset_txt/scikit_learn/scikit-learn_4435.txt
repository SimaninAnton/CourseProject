It seems at some point the impl function of the OneClassSVM got renamed to _impl. If I load an SVM I trained a year ago in the current version of scikit-learn, I get the following error after calling predict():
AttributeError: 'OneClassSVM' object has no attribute '_impl'
I think there should be at least
a proper way of saving models (not pickle or joblib) which does not save the object, but only its data, or
before deleting a function, it should be made deprecated for some time, or
a way of converting an old model into a new one
It might well be that one of these solutions exist and I am just not capable of finding and using them. If so, please let me know how I can use my old model with the current version of scikit-learn.
You can download the model from:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45267030/stuff/fly_svmNovelty.zip
Unzip the folder and load it with:
from sklearn import svm
import joblib

noveltyClassfyPath = '.../fly_svmNovelty/flyNovelty.svm'
noveltyClassfy = joblib.load(noveltyClassfyPath)
hog = np.random.rand(81)
noveltyClassfy.predict(hog)
