I just fixed the spelling of 'charset' in a parameter name (#2106), but I wonder if all 'charset'-related parameters should be deprecated and renamed to 'encoding'.
The notion that a text's encoding represents a 'character set' is outdated. For example, both UTF-8 and UTF-16 represent the same set of characters, which is Unicode, but they do so with very different encodings.
Changing the parameter name to 'encoding' would better match other Python functions, most notably the .decode() and .encode() methods, and would also match the Python Unicode HOWTO.
