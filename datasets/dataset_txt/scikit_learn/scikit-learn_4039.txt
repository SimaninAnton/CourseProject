I have a dataset of 35 samples and 28 classes. In a DecisionTreeClassifier, predict_proba returns a list of 28 numpy.ndarray, all with size (35,2) or (35,1). I don't understand:
What are the two values in the ndarray? Shouldn't there just be one, the probability of that class being predicted? In which case the array would just be (28,35)?
Why sometimes there are only (35,1) values?
I'm providing some data to replicate my issue.
import pickle
with open('sampledata.pickle') as f:
    X, Y, x_true, y_true = pickle.load(f)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, x_true)
pp = clf.predict_proba(Y)

print len(pp)
print (pp[1].shape) ## one that has (35,1) size
