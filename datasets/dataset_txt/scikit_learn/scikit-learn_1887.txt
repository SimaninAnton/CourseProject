Scikit learn has two nearly identical ways of performing spectral clustering:
a SpectralClustering class
a spectral_clustering method
The slightly divergent docs and function call signatures are confusing, I think. Both of these live in the same file (clustering/spectral.py), and with mostly identical docstrings, having both doubles the documentation burden.
Is there a compelling reason to keep these both around? @jnothman @GaelVaroquaux @briancheung @weilinear
