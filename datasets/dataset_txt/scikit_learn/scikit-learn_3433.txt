On the installation page, it says:
"We don’t recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on linux, as this will involve a lengthy build-process with many dependencies. Without careful configuration, building numpy yourself can lead to an installation that is much slower than it should be. If you are using Linux, consider using your package manager to install scikit-learn. It is usually the easiest way, but might not provide the newest version. If you haven’t already installed numpy and scipy and can’t install them via your operation system, it is recommended to use a third party distribution."
Isn't it suppose to be We recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on linux?
