I just upgraded sklearn on one of my boxes and current master had a weird issue related to a PIL import ("AccessInit: hash collision: 3 for both 1 and 1"). The error is caused by a mucked up system, but I would argue that we should not try to import PIL when applying a clustering algorithm (I was trying to import kmeans).
I think the PIL import came via matplotlib, but I did not find where that got pulled in.
I could reproduce simply by import sklearn.cluster.
