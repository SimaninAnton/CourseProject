Currently with the default parameters, CategoricalEncoder produces one hot encoded features, where each column of the original data has a norm equal to 1. That is fine when the latter processing is not sensitive to the feature scaling, however in the opposite case (e.g. with KNN, or when doing dimensionality reduction) it might be useful to have some mechanism to weight / normalize different input categories differently.
Particularly since unlike with encoding='ordinal', with encoding='onehot' it's not that trivial to do this weighting after the encoder. Maybe this could be done either by adding a categories_weight parameter or with an example in the doc illustrating how to efficiently do this scaling after the encoder?
