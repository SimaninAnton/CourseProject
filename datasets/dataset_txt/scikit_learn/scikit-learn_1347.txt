I think adding permutation based feature importances would be cool:

There is a python package that does it for our random forests with bagging:
https://github.com/parrt/random-forest-importances
But I'd rather like to see a generic permutation based importance score with cross-validation or hold-out.
I think this would be great analysis tool.
One easy way to implement it would be to provide a function for plotting etc. But Ideally we'd be able to use it in feature selection, I think, so we'd need to create a meta-estimator PermutationImportanceCV that only provides feature_importances_, I guess, so it can be wrapped with SelectFromModel?
