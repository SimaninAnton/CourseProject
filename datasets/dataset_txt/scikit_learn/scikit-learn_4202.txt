Hi,
I was wondering whether there was an in-built function to make a k-fold cross-validation where each class is artificially equalized within the training (and optionally the testing) set(s):
E.g. y = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
=> train = [0, 0, 1, 1], test = [0, 1]
I know it's not optimal to throw some data out (and we should favor stratified foldings), but some do sometimes want to get a chance level at 50% .
If this feature do not already exist, do you think it'd be better to add it as an option in StratifiedKfold and StratifiedShuffleSplit or do you think a separate function would be more appropriate?
Thanks!
