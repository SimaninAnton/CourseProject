Ran into some test failures when building on CentOS 6 with Python 2.7 and NumPy 1.13. Presumably will see the same issues with other Python versions and maybe OSes as well. Though will follow-up on that. In the detail below are the test failures and a link to the build log. This was part of the conda-forge build in PR ( conda-forge/scikit-learn-feedstock#47 ).
