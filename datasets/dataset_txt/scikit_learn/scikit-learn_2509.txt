Currently doing
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)
y = np.random.randint(1, 3, 100)
cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), X, y, scoring='roc_auc')
raises an error, because y is not 0s and 1s.
IMO it would be ok to internally & automatically binarize y_true before computing the AUC to avoid unnecessary extra steps from the user.
