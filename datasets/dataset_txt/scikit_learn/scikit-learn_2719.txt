In my specific case we have the following pipeline:
clf_grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=SGDClassifier, param_grid=param_grid)

pipeline = make_pipeline(
    VarianceThreshold(),
    StandardScaler(),
    clf_grid
)
However, let's also imagine the case where an arbitrary number of additional feature selection steps are applied in the middle of the pipeline. How do you find out which features are selected and passed into the final estimator (clf_grid)?
I saw this StackOverflow answer, but that relied on specific knowledge of the intermediate steps. I'm requesting a versatile method for finding either:
the feature names in the final estimator
a boolean vector of whether each input feature was selected for the final estimator
Filing this here rather than on StackOverflow, since I couldn't find any versatile method in the docs to find selected features at the end of a pipeline.
