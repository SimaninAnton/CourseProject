There are failing tests on 32 bit platforms. I am using this issue as a unifying place for all of the related issues as they have been reported, since some were originally thought to be platform/linear algebra specific.
There are variable failures in LLE, KernelPCA, and CCA which are mentioned in:
#3255
#1632
