Description
The documentation for the Countvectorizer and TfidfVectorizer is not clear about the interaction between token_pattern and passing a custom tokenizer. Currently, when a tokenizer is passed, the token_pattern is ignored. But the docstring entry for the tokenizer parameter only mentions Override the string tokenization step while preserving the preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.. To me, it was not immediately clear that this meant that token_pattern was not used at all.
Here' a user that got thrown by this: Stackoverflow
Some things I can think of:
raise a warning if the user passes a (non-standard) token pattern and a custom tokenizer
update the docstring to be explicit about the interaction
