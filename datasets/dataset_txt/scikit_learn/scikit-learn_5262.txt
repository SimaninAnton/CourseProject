There are 3 nested for-loops....
I think we should try to see if it is possible to vectorize. I haven't had the formular before me when I looked at the code and it wasn't so clear.
Maybe go through the formular again and see if vectorization is sensible.
Otherwise, we might have to resort to cython.
