Description
As a first time user of DBSCAN (and similarly dbscan), I wanted to use a precomputed distance matrix. The documentation specifies that "X is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be square". However, X also needs to be triangular. I'm requesting that this detail be added to the documentation to help future users.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
For example, the following example generates error.
triangle = [[0,3,4],[3,0,6],[4,6,0]]
db = DBSCAN(eps=1, metric="precomputed")
y_db = db.fit(triangle) 
Main Error: ValueError: Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)
But the following does not produce errors:
upper_triangle = [[0,3,4],[0,0,6],[0,0,0]]
db = DBSCAN(eps=1, metric="precomputed")
y_db = db.fit(upper_triangle)
Would be very helpful if documentation clarified this distinction! Thank you!
