I think the way to go to rewrite the svmlight loader in Cython is to stop doing memory management plain and simple. I suggest one of the following 2 solutions:
give up on not making copy: we build the arrays incrementally in std vectors then make a copy to obtain a numpy arrays
use a subset of the file to estimate the size of the arrays and then allocate them once for all (hopefully!)
