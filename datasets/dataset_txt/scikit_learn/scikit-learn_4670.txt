A primary purpose of using a sparse matrix is memory considerations. To have a method like pairwise.cosine_similiarity that accepts sparse input and returns a dense matrix runs counter to this. For cosine_similairty the culprit is that the call to safe_sparse_dot from linear_kernel has dense_output set to True. I don't see any mathematical reason for this to be the case. It looks like it just wasn't exposed up through the chain of cosine_simlarity--->linear_kernel--->safe_sparse_dot.
