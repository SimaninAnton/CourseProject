In SVC with decision_function_shape="ovr" argmax of the decision function is not the same as predict. This is related to the tie-breaking mentioned in #8276.
The decision_function now includes tie-breaking, which the predict doesn't.
I'm not sure the tie-breaking is good, but we should be consistent either way.
