See http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/utilities.html#efficient-linear-algebra-array-operations. extmath.safe_sparse_dot is a link but not extmath.randomized_svd for example.
Quickly looking at it, it seems like the fix is to add the problematic entries to doc/modules/classes.rst.
For some context, I bumped into this because I wanted to point someone to sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd but could not find it by googling.
