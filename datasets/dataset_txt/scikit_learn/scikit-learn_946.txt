Description
clone will fail if the estimator has a parameter of dict datatype. In such case deepcopy will be performed as shown here, and thus the cloned dict will not pass the sanity check.
Suggestion
As mentioned here, dict datatype is currently not handled... Is that possible to fall back to standard equality test?
