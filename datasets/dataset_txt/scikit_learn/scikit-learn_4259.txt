Hello, I was trying to find sklearn's Agglomerative Clustering, as per
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering
I have scratched around and it seems to have been moved into heirarchy.py, although my version of sklearn was downloaded only 5 weeks ago (I am a python newby). Am I missing something here (ie should I reregister sklearn) or is there something amiss with the source code? Thanks
