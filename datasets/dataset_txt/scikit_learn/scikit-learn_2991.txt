I get regular emails from people asking for help, due to the fact that I wrote some parts of scikit-learn and my email is listed on the top of the page (I'm sure everyone who has worked on open source has similar).
While I don't normally mind helping, it would be more useful if these questions (which are often quite similar) were public on stackovervlow or similar.
My suggestion is to add the following lines after the "Author" comment at the top of each file:
# Please do not contact developers directly with bug requests or feature requests. Instead, please make a request at XXX
XXX could be this github page, Stack Overflow, the mailing list (I would recommend just one option though). It might also be a landing page, like scikit-learn.org/gettinghelp
Thoughts?
