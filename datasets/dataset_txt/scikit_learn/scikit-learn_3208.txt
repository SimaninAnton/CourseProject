While calling dump_svmlight_file with multilabel=True, an scipy.sparse.csr.csr_matrix passed as y
it would cause the following error
    if Xval.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:
IndexError: tuple index out of range
I think the problem is caused by y = np.asarray(y) here
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/datasets/svmlight_format.py#L388
which np.asarray seems to make csr_matrix a 0d array.
