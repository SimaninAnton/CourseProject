There are several projects working on smarter ways to search parameters.
Right now, BaseSearchCV makes it really hard to customize parts, mostly because the fit function is really long, and changing anything in the parameter loop means copying the whole fit method, see here.
Maybe factoring this out into a method, or just splitting up fit a bit more might be a good idea?
