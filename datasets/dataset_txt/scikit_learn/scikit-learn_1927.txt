I've been working with sklearn models and I noticed that for some of them (for example MLPRegressor) if 0/1 are passed instead of False/True, an error is raised. I don't know if this is an intended behaviour or just a missing feature.
I would like to thank you guys for the amazing work on sklearn, it is really an awesome package, keep uo the good work ;)
