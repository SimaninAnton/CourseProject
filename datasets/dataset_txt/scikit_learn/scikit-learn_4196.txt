In AdaBoost, if the base estimator doesn't support sample_weight, the error message is not very explicit for beginners in machine learning or people who didn't read the documentation.
We should raise a more explicit message like "base estimator / weak learner doesn't support sample_weight".
The following line in bagging.py could be refactored into an utility function has_sample_weight:
