I am trying to generate quadratic features for a feature-set consists of 30 features. Apparently, the current approach of generating features is far from optimal it relies on enumerating an exponential number of alternatives then pruning them!
Check _power_matrix method in the preprocessing module, here.
I propose using counting over only the valid alternatives using combinatorics technique called Indistinguishable Objects distributed over Distinguishable Boxes.
To make my ideas clear, here is my implementation with a description.
If you guys find it useful, I am gonna send it as a PR.
