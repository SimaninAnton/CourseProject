This is a feature request.
In the current implementation of __pprint it is hardcoded to shorten any representation over 500.
        if len(this_repr) > 500:
            this_repr = this_repr[:300] + '...' + this_repr[-100:]

I'd request a way to override that if need be. In my particular usecase I want to record the exact pipeline which was used along side of the results in a datafile so I'd like to get a representation of it which is not shortened in this manner.
