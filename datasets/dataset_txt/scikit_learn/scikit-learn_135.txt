Description
The rotate parameter has no effect in sklearn.tree.plot_tree function.
After checking the code the rotate parameter has been inherited from the sklearn.tree.export_graphviz but has no effect in the code, simply because matplotlib does not manage this option.
Two possibility here
rotate can be simply removed
a warning is thrown when rotate is activated in plot_tree
I would be happy to propose a PR, just let me know which solution would be preferable
Steps/Code to Reproduce
See #13971
