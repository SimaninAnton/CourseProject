Hi,
Using scikit learn, I have in output top features order by importance.
I would like this information per id/line. Why ? For business, it could be very interesting to know the top contributing features of the score by id to qualify interest/problem of customer.
How to have these informations per customer?
Thanks for your return.
M.
