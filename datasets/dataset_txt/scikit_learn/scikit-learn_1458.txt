Description
pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>: it's not found as __builtin__.instancemethod is thrown when joblib is used to persist the object.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
My line of code is
joblib.dump(self.vec, 'models/vectorizer.pkl').
The declaration of self.vec is
self.vec = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), tokenizer=self.tokenize,
               min_df=3, max_df=0.9, strip_accents='unicode', use_idf=1,
               smooth_idf=1, sublinear_tf=1 )
Expected Results
I expect the TfIdfVectorizer to be persisted to disk and no error thrown
Actual Results
pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>: it's not found as __builtin__.instancemethod
