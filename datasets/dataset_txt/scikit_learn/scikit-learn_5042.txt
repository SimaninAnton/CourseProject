The chi2 kernel has a gamma parameter over which one needs to grid-search for the use in SVC.
Currenlty, I think this is only possible doing something like this:
param_grid=dict(kernel = [lambda x, y : chi2_kernel(x, y, gamma) for gamma in [.1, .01, .001]]) 
Unfortunately this doesn't pickle because of the lambda function, so only n_jobs=1 is possible.
Is there a way around that I don't see?
