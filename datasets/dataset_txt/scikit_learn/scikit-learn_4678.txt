RFECV has some issues
scores.shape[1] is chosen as n_features which is the number of evaluations in the worst case (step size 1); if a different step size is chosen not all cells are filled. Cells are initialized with zero; for each evaluation the score is added to the cell - scores can be either all negative or all positive (depending on the scorer); finally the max is chosen: this is a bug in the case of negative scores and step != 1.
best score is the sum of all CV evaluations not the mean - this is confusing because the best score cannot be related to the other CV experiments.
the number of final features selected is k -- which seems to refer to the RFE.ranking_ of features where ties have the same rank. Imagine a ranking where are two blocks of tied features [1,1,1,2,2,2]. Since k is at most 1 only two features n_features_to_select = k+1 could be selected at most ... maybe I'm not getting the whole picture but it smells fishy (ping @amueller @NicolasTr )
