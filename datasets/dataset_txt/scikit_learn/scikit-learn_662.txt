#11754 introduces a warning that is very confusing to me.
I get a bunch of warnings of the form:
ConvergenceWarning: Objective did not converge. You might want to increase the number of iterations. Duality gap: 6.524430864374153e-05, tolerance: 2.30509725
What's confusing is:
the tolerance is bigger than the duality gap, so I would assume that means convergence.
the tolerance is not what was passed, which is 0.001
the duality gap is smaller than the tolerance that was passed.
I have no idea what's going on here.

minimal example:
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_boston()
lasso = LassoCV().fit(boston.data, boston.target)
