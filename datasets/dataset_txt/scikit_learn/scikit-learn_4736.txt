We should split preprocessing.py since it is quite big. I was thinking of preprocessing/data.py (scaler, normalizer, binarizer), preprocessing/label.py (label binarizer / encoder) and preprocessing/imputation.py. Of course, all functions and classes should be imported in __init__.py for backward compatibility. WDYT?
