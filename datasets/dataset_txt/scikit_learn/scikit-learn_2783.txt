While browsing the tests for scikit-learn I came across test_neighbors_metrics() in test_neighbors.py, where different algorithmic versions of NearestNeighbors are tested for different metrics. There are some exceptions for the kd-Tree version, since it only supports some metrics (which is tested for).
However, the results of the kd-tree version -- if it is usable -- is never checked against the brute force version as it is the case for the ball tree version. A version where the result of the kd-tree algorithm is tested for valid metrics is in the following gist.
