Description
#10587 added multiclass support for balanced_accuracy_score(). With that, the 3.3.2.3. Balanced accuracy score section of the user guide was amended. The PR however missed updating the overview in 3.3.2. Classification metrics which still says that the metric is restricted to the binary classification case.
balanced_accuracy_score() in 3.3.2. should be moved to the "Others also work in the multiclass case" table.
