is failing because the data source is down, which makes circle ci fail.
It also used the deprecated matplotlib stock interface, and has been causing some issues in the past.
I think we should either store the data ourselves and not use matplotlib to read it, or possibly change the example entirely.
It was written by @GaelVaroquaux, maybe he has an opinion.
