I'm working on Passive-Aggressive algorithm recently, and now i would like to modify the algorithm.
I traced the code and found that the loss function were import by sgd_fast.pyd
As far as I know,it was written in sgd_fast.pyx and sgd_fast.c and compile to pyd file.
So I re-download the code from github, make a simple modification of sgd_fast.pyx at first.
Just a little change of print which report epoch information:
            # report epoch information
            if verbose > 0:
                with gil:
                    print("Norm: %.2f, NNZs: %d, "                            # change the content of print here
                          "Bias: %.6f, T: %d, Avg. loss: %.6f"
                          % (w.norm(), weights.nonzero()[0].shape[0],
                             intercept, count, sumloss / count))
                    print("Total training time: %.2f seconds."
                          % (time() - t_start))
Then I run the "setup.py" under "scikit-learn" file folder ,got a new "sgd_fast.pyd" under linear-model folder.
But when I run my code which import Passive Aggressive Classifier from linear-model again, the output report information seems nothing changes.
Isn't it the correct way to modify pyx file? or should I modify the sgd_fast.c?
But the print function was only written in pyx, I'm wondering why the modification cannot work:(
It would be grateful if someone can help me for the issue, thanks a lot
