It is a bit strange how importing FunctionTransformer will import assert_allclose_dense_sparse which imports pytest.
It would be slightly cleaner to move the pytest decorators to a _test_decorators file like: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/util/_test_decorators.py
(This may be a little harder since our pytest decorators are public)
