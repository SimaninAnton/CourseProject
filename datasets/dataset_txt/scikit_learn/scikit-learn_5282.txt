The shapes of decision_function and predict_proba are inconsistent across classifiers for the two-label case.
As far as I can see, all classifier except LDA and QDA have a (n_samples,) shape decision_function and all classifiers
except SGDClassifier have (n_samples, 2) shape predict_proba. So I guess we should make all classifiers have that shape.
Btw, this means atm LDA and QDA don't work with multiclass and probably some other methods.
