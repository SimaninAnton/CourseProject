Currently, there's no way to specify random_state for cross_val_score; wouldn't that be something useful (it seems pretty simple to pass it on to the check_cv, and then to KFold or StratifiedKFold)?
Also the documentation for cross_val_score has a typo:
If the estimator is a classifier or if y is neither binary nor multiclass, :class:KFold is used
should be "if the estimator is not a classifier".
