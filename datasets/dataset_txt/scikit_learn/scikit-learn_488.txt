layout.html contains a lot of code that is specific to index, and so I think it should be in index.rst.
I'm not entirely sure how we can insert things into the block from a rst file but I'm pretty sure it should be possible (with ``.. only:: html and then using jinja there?)
Anyway, it's weird to have part of the landing page hard-coded in the layout.
