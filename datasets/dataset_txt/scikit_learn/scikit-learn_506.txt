In the new GBDTs we bin the data before calling train_test_split() (for early-stopping).
That means that the validation set is also used to find the bin thresholds (it is of course not used to find the split points!).
I feel like the "data leak" is very minimal, but it seems more correct to bin X_train and X_val separately.
@ogrisel WDYT?
