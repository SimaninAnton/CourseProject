I know in sklearn.svm.SVC, you could throw in the probability=True keyword argument into the constructor so the SVC could use the predict_proba function. In turn, you could use predict_proba to evaluate an SVC using AUC.
However, it doesn't seem you could use the probability=True parameter for sklearn.svm.LinearSVC, and it would be great if we could evaluate a LinearSVC using AUC.
