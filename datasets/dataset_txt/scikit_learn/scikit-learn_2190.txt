In the documentation, there is no mention of what have to be done with the docstring a deprecated parameter.
However, I could not find clearly what is the way. I saw two patterns:
Simply remove the docstring.
Make a note that the parameter has been deprecated with the information related to the versions.
In the last version (0.19), every deprecation used the first variant.
@jnothman @GaelVaroquaux @amueller Could you confirm which variant shall we used such that the documentation can be updated accordingly.
