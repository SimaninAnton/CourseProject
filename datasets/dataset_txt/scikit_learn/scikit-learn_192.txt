This is the last Sphinx warning:
WARNING: autodoc: failed to import function 'cholesky_delete' from module 'arrayfuncs'; the following exception was raised: No module named 'arrayfuncs'
It was already raised in #13380.
Thanks to @grisel and @jeremiedbb the responsible has been identified.
Apparently the cython type of the cholesky_delete function (fused function) makes sphinx misbehave with respect to the sphinx function template.
Sphinx can't link correctly the cholesky_delete function: see here and for comparison the min_pos rendering and the cholesky_delete rendering.
A simple solution is to just remove cholesky_delete from documentation, considering that cholesky_delete is already undocumented and a reorganisation of utils is ongoing making private a number of public functions (#6616, #15223, #15225).
If you do not agree with this solution I will investigate more into sphinx and cython incompatibility... However, I hope you agree, as I could propose a PR.
