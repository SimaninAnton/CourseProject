It seems that the MDS PR was in parallel to my "pairwise" PR.
I didn't realize that MDS takes a distance matrix as input. It is now the only algorithm in sklearn that does that. I would suggest using some standard distance instead.
This breaks backward compatibility but I'd really like to have some consistent API there.
