Currently we have a long list of exclusions (sklearn.utils.testing.{DONT_TEST,OTHER,META_ESTIMATORS}) from our common tests. We would like every estimator to undergo some amount of common testing. This is a concern of #6715, and one potential solution is #6599, which would allow us to annotate each estimator with its traits from which each test's applicability can be determined.
However:
some estimators (such as Pipeline, GridSearchCV) cannot be constructed without explicit parameters.
some estimators' behaviour differs substantially between some parameter choices such that each should be checked by common tests (see also #7270 (comment)).
To allow more estimators to be tested upon discovery, we need a way to specify the parameter sets that it may be constructed with for basic API testing.
