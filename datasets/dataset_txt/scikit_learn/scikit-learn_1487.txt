I fit a model using scikit-learn NMF model on my training data. Now I perform an inverse transform of new data using
result_1 = model.inverse_transform(model.transform(new_data))
Then I compute the inverse transform of my data manually taking the components from the NMF model, using the equation as in Slide 15 here.
temp = np.dot(model.components_, model.components_.T)
transform = np.dot(np.dot(model.components_.T, np.linalg.pinv(temp)), 
model.components_)
result_2 = np.dot(new_data, transform)
I would like to understand why the 2 results do not match. What am I doing wrong while computing the inverse transform and reconstructing the data?
