I posted this question on stackoverflow a few days ago. Essentially, I'm trying to perform a one hot encoding for multiple features:
data = [['a', 'dog', 'red']
        ['b', 'cat', 'green']]
The OneHotEncoder only accepts integer features. But to produce the integer features, you would use a LabelEncoder for each feature. And after this process, you have to store each individual LabelEncoder, as well as a mapping to the index of the feature they encoded.
We should have a class in scikit-learn to perform the entire LabelEncoding on the entire feature matrix.
