While LogisticRegression can handle string labels, LogisticRegressionCV fails when labels are strings with ValueError: could not convert string to float
I guess the problem comes from calling
y_test = check_array(y_test, dtype=np.float64, ensure_2d=False)
within function _log_reg_scoring_path in file logistic.py
