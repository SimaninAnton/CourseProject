Using the univariate feature selection, I've stumbled over a bug (at least I think so) while analyzing the f_oneway implementation.
ssbn = 0.
for k, _ in enumerate(args):
     ssbn += square_of_sums_args[k] / n_samples_per_class[k]
Although ssbn is initialized as float, the division through the integer n_samples_per_class[k] is performed first. Thus, the computed between-group sum of squares ssbn is wrong.
I would suggest to change the affected line to:
ssbn += square_of_sums_args[k] / float(n_samples_per_class[k])
Best,
