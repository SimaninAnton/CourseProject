Some warnings raised during testing show that we do not use ConvergenceWarning when it is appropriate in some cases. For example (from here):
/home/lesteve/dev/alt-scikit-learn/sklearn/decomposition/fastica_.py:118: UserWarning: FastICA did not converge. Consider increasing tolerance or the maximum number of iterations.
/home/lesteve/dev/alt-scikit-learn/sklearn/cluster/birch.py:629: UserWarning: Number of subclusters found (2) by Birch is less than (3). Decrease the threshold.
These should be changed, at least. For bonus points, the contributor could look for other warning messages that mention "converge".
