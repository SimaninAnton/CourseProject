I came across a few threads explaining why GridSearchCV may hang when n_jobs = -1 (e.g. #4080). But, is there any reason GridSearchCV would hang when run inside a map transformation on Spark when n_jobs = 1? Substituting the non-CV underlying estimator (KNN) for the CV version runs fine. Using the CV version hangs, indefinitely.
