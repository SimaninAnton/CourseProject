In sklearn v0.19.1:
The default value for cv in /sklearn/model_selection/_split.py is cv=3 . It then checks if the passed in value of cv is None, and if it, it assigns cv = 3.
In sklearn v0.20.dev0:
The default value for cv in /sklearn/model_selection/_split.py is cv='warn' &
when cv == 'warn', cv is assigned the value of 3.
However, there is no check for if cv is None.
This is breaking code compatibility with older version.
