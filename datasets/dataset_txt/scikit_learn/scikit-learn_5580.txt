The reduced_likelihood_function() in gaussian_process/gaussian_process.py returns np.inf when the Cholesky decomposition of R raises an np.linalg.LinAlg exception. When the objective function of scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla returns np.inf, the optimizer passes np.nan to the objective function (I raised this issue on scipy-user). This np.nan causes an exception when trying to do the Cholesky decomposition again, because this time R is full of np.nan.
Maybe there are three routes to fixing this issue
Do something other than return np.inf when the Cholesky decomposition raises a LinAlg exception
Have reduced_likelihood_function() treat a nan argument better than raising an exception, in such a way that fmin_cobyla can proceed.
Use an optimizer different from fmin_cobyla -- one that handles values of np.inf better.
