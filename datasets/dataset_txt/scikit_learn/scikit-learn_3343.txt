Hi!
For reference, see this issue: scikit-multilearn/scikit-multilearn#25
While trying to get scikit-multilearn's label powerset and binary relevance strategies to work with k-fold cross validation, as the PR for label powerset here is stalled for a long time, I noticed that they don't work with each other for a simple reason.
My targets have the format of np.array / (1, 8). scikit-learn classifiers and strategies automatically (?) use this format for predicted targets as well. scikit-multilearn however returns a list of vectors. When printing, both look like this: [array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])].
While np.array (1-D) produces a multiclass-indicator, a list of target vectors produces multilabel-multioutput targets, despite of the same appearance.
I wonder whether or not one could view those as equivalent, or if you expect lists always to be multi output targets. Any suggestions or ideas on what level this should be "fixed"?
