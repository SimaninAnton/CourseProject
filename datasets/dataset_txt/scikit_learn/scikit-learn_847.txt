The webpage of the documentation of selection.ParameterGrid (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ParameterGrid.html)
includes a link labelled as "Read more in the User Guide.".
The underlying URL under "User Guide" is "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/search.html" which is not precisely a user guide. Should the link be targeting something like https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html ?
