While sklearn provides a linear regression implementation of elastic nets (sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet), the logistic regression function (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression) allows only L1 or L2 regularization. The lack of this functionality is the only thing keeping me from switching all my machine learning from R (glmnet package) to sklearn. I don't have the expertise to implement this feature, but wanted to let any interested developers know that the feature would be appreciated!
