Attempting to find a list of all regressors does not include sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.
e.g.
>>> from sklearn.utils.testing import all_estimators
>>> regressors = set(name for name, cls in all_estimators(type_filter='regressor'))
>>> assert 'LogisticRegression' in regressors
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
AssertionError
