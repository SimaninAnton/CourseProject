I am re-implementing some SVC functions so as to avoid storing _dual_coef_ and support_vectors_, and keep a coef_ array instead.
I managed to make it work except for svc.predict_proba(). Is it possible to estimate predict_proba with coef_ but without _dual_coef_ and support_vectors_? If so, is there some python scripts I could get [/inspiration from]?
Here's a full example of my current setup: https://gist.github.com/kingjr/cdc853e09aae9dde537c
