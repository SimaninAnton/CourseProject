I think there is an error in the documentation regarding feature importance evaluation
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#feature-importance-evaluation
It says the "The relative rank (i.e. depth) of a feature used as a decision node in a tree can be used to assess the relative importance of that feature with respect to the predictability of the target variable.".
In actuality, the importance of a variable is calculated using the mean decrease in gini impurity. Not the rank of the feature.
If it is not wrong, it is at least confusing.
