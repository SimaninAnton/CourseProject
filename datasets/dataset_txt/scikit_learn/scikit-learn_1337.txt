Currently, Circle CI will not run the example if I understand correctly.
Very few examples don't begin with plot_ and I think it's beneficial to show the result on the web page, even if there's not a plot here. (See e.g., http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/plot_feature_stacker.html)
What do others think?
(Note that we also need to replace links to hetero_feature_union.py with links to column_transformer.py)
ping @jnothman maybe we can do all the things in #11216
