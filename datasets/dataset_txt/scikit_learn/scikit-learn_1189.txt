On two of my recent PRs (#11732, #11735), one of travis-ci tests fails because the computed output from the code in the pipeline is different than the one in the PR.
Apparently, it's the same pipeline configuration which fails on both PRs, and the rest of the travis pipelines agree with what's computed on my machine.
The failed tests are:
https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/411240547
https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/411177168
The difference is rather large 0.9736 vs 0.9666 as the score in one case, and 27.8393 vs 27.7033 as the negative log likelihood in the other case.
Any idea why or how I should try to diagnose the issue?
