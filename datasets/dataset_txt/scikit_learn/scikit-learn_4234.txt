I have approx 500 features, some of which are all zero for the training data. I know I can remove these to avoid the error, but I'm wondering if the error is safe to ignore.
And why does the feature selector hiccup on this instead of just removing the features with stdev == 0? (It seems the error happens in a feature selection class.)
