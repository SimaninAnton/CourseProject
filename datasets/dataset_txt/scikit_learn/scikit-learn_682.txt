Description
According to https://bugs.python.org/issue28579 does not work as I expected.
But ML package has a lot of situation to handling NaN value and this situation actually happened
during I worked on #13231 (comment).
scikit-learn/sklearn/utils/testing.py
Line 89 in 7639886
 assert_equal = _dummy.assertEqual 

So my proposal is implementing new assert_equal to support NaN equal operation.
And if this proposal is accepted, I'd like to work on this issue.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
from sklearn.utils.testing import assert_equal

assert_equal(float('NaN'), float('NaN'))
Expected Results
from sklearn.utils.testing import assert_equal

assert_equal(float('NaN'), float('NaN')) # pass
Actual Results
from sklearn.utils.testing import assert_equal

assert_equal(float('NaN'), float('NaN')) # fail
Versions
