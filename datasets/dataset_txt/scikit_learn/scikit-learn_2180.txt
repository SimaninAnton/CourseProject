Description
The coordinate_descent.enet_path() method has objective function:

While the cd_fast.enet_coordinate_descent() method has objective function:

Which is missing the "1/n" value in the RSS term.
The soft-thresholding in cd_fast.enet_coordinate_descent() is consistent with the cd_fast.enet_coordinate_descent() objective function, where:

sign(t) * max(|t| - {(2/2)^-1}alpha, 0) = sign(t) * max(|t| - alpha, 0)
However, if we follow the objective function in coordinate_descent.enet_path() method, the soft-thresholding should be: sign(t) * max(|t| - {(2/2n)^-1}alpha, 0) = sign(t) * max(|t| - n*alpha, 0) instead.
Is this 1/n factor handled elsewhere so that the soft-thresholding is unaffected?
