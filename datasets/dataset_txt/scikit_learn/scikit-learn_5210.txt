manifold.MDS is just a wrapper around maifold.mds.smacof, and is supposed to pass its keyword args to it. But it seems to forget to pass in the n_jobs argument.
    self.embedding_, self.stress_ = smacof(X, metric=self.metric,
                                 n_components=self.n_components,
                                 init=init,
                                 n_init=self.n_init,
                                 max_iter=self.max_iter,
                                 verbose=self.verbose,
                                 eps=self.eps,
                                 random_state=self.random_state)
