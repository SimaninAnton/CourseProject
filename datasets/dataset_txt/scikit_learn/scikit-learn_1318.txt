I think that adding a library functionality to export scikit-learn trees to anotherwell known and widely used tree representation format as the Newick Format (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html) is worthwhile. I'm not aware that scikit-learn currently offers such functionality with any format different than DOT.
For example, using the Newick Format interface scikit-learn users could use @jhcepas ETE package (https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete) for tree exploration and visualization.
I'm gladly willing to contribute.
