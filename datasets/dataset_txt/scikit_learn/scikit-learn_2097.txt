dear all,
when i run spectral clustering code in python this warning is shown:
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2\lib\site-packages\sklearn\manifold\spectral_embedding_.py:229: UserWarning: Graph is not fully connected, spectral embedding may not work as expected.
warnings.warn("Graph is not fully connected, spectral embedding"
Could anyone explain why this warning is shown, what's wrong?
