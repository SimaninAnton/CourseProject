In v0.21.3 per the Discretization section of the preprocessing module there are only two transformers that will discretize data:
Binarizer()
KBinsDiscretizer().
Unfortunately, KBinsDiscretizer() implies that you are passing "k" number of bins and there is some strategy to determine k such as ‘uniform’, ‘quantile’, ‘kmeans’. This does not provide any opportunity for the user to supply their own cut points like the pandas function cut().
I am requesting a feature that creates a transformer that will provide functionality similar to pandas.cut() that will allow you to bin data based on a user-supplied bin array and even allow for things like labeling and ordering.
