As highlighted in this notebook the current implementation of StratifiedKFold (which is used by default by cross_val_score and GridSearchCV for classification problems) breaks the dependency structure of the dataset by computing the folds based on the sorted labels.
Instead one should probably do an implementation that performs individual dependency preserving KFold on for each possible label value and aggregate the folds to get the StratifiedKFold final folds.
This might incur a refactoring to get rid of the _BaseKFold base class. It might also make it easier to implement a shuffle=True option for StratifiedKFold.
