https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py#L758 shows that if the vocabulary size is larger than 65535, it will throw overflow exception, because it uses "i" when it makes array. https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html
Is there any reason behind this design? I feel like with modern hardware it should be able to support a much larger vocabulary. Not sure why we still keep this code.
