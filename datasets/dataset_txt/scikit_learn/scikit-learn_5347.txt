Running SGDRegressor.partial_fit multiple times on certain data sometimes causes an underflow error. This error should be handled internally by SGDRegressor.
e.g.
from datetime import date
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier, SGDRegressor

clf = SGDRegressor()

s = date(2010,1,1)
i = 0
training = []
for _ in xrange(12):
    i += 1
    training.append([[date(2012,1,i).toordinal()], i])

clf.partial_fit(X=[X for X,_ in training], y=[y for _,y in training])
clf.partial_fit(X=[X for X,_ in training], y=[y for _,y in training])
clf.partial_fit(X=[X for X,_ in training], y=[y for _,y in training])
