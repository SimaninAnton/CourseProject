Hello sklearn-Community!
I think I found a minor issue. If I only want to use externals I get an error:
>>> from sklearn import externals
>>> externals.joblib
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'joblib'
If I import another module along with externals it works like expected:
>>> from sklearn import utils, externals
>>> externals.joblib
<module 'sklearn.externals.joblib' from '/Users/frank/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/__init__.pyc'>
I use 0.17.dev0 version on Enthought Canopy Python 2.7.6.
Thanks a lot for sklearn!
Best,
Frank
