The documentation for this example contains a broken sentence (both in master and 0.17.1).
Steps/Code to Reproduce
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_outlier_detection_housing.html
The sentence "The One-Class SVM algorithm" hangs at the end of this paragraph:
"Although the robust covariance estimate is able to focus on the main mode of the data distribution, it sticks to the assumption that the data should be Gaussian distributed, yielding some biased estimation of the data structure, but yet accurate to some extent. The One-Class SVM algorithm[...followed by next section title]"
Possibly this sentence is starting to explain how the OneClass SVM is different to the robust covariance estimate. I have no domain knowledge here so I can't suggest a fix.
Sidenote - in 0.17.1 the second plot's labels are broken (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/plot_outlier_detection_housing_002.png) however this is fixed in master.
