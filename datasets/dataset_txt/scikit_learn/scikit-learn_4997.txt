I'm having problems with CountVectorizer() when processing character digrams.
text = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'
vect = CountVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(2,2) )
X = vect.fit_transform(text)
==> ValueError: empty vocabulary; training set may have contained only stop words or min_df (resp. max_df) may be too high (resp. too low).
What I'm expecting from the code above is a frequency count of character digrams - eg "th", "he", "qu", "ui",....
Is this a user error or have I found a bug?
