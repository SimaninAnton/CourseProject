Description
I would say there is an error in Stochastic Gradient Descent - Mathematical formulation.
It says that features x goes from 1 to n and than that each feature x is n-element vector. Plus than it would be multiplied by w which is m-element vector - so yea "does not compute" :)
Expected Results
IMO - x should be m-element vector in n-feature feature set.
Versions
I saw it in master - if I read it correctly:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/doc/modules/sgd.rst#mathematical-formulation
should be 1-character change so even I could handle it :D , but I wanted to verify that I read it correctly :)
