Once import sklearn worked fine in my ubuntu 14.04.4 version. Then I upgraded to ubuntu 16.04LTS.
Importing numpy, scipy and matplotlib are still fine, but when I import sklearn, I got the error:
RuntimeError: module compiled against API version a but this version of numpy is 9
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
Here is the module version:
python: 2.7.12
numpy: 1.9.2
scipy: 0.17.0
matplotlib: 1.5.1
scikit-learn: 0.17.1 (by pip show scikit-learn)
I tried the suggestion from @matthew-brett at
#3537 (comment)
pip uninstall numpy
apt-get install --reinstall python-numpy
but the problem is still same.
