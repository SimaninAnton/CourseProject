I tried to run a k-means clustering on 144 .csv data files that contains 30,000 simple (x, y) coordinates each. I jammed all of .csv together into a numPy array named X and tried to feed it into However, this seemed to fail with this error message.

    % (array.ndim, estimator_name))
ValueError: Found array with dim 3. Estimator expected <= 2.
Here is my source code:
# zipped_list contains the (x, y) coordinates for the 144 files
#  breakdown: 144 individual lists within list -> each list contains 30,000 (x, y) tuples
X = np.array(zipped_list)

# number of clusters*****************
k = 2

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = k)
kmeans.fit(X)
y_kmeans = kmeans.predict(X)
