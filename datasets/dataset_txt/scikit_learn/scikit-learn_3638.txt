Pre-requisitions:
Ubuntu 15.10 and 15.04
Reproduce steps:
Enter into "doc" folder by type cmd: cd scikit-learn/doc
Type cmd: make latexpdf
When building, following error will be pop up and the building process will halt to waiting users' input:
Error Information:

and if I just type "return", then build process can be continued, however, at last, build will fail:
Last Error Information:
Output written on user_guide.pdf (2144 pages, 61192593 bytes).
Transcript written on user_guide.log.
Makefile:54: recipe for target 'user_guide.pdf' failed
make[1]: *** [user_guide.pdf] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/kevin/research/openSource/scikit-learn/doc/_build/latex'
Makefile:74: recipe for target 'latexpdf' failed
make: *** [latexpdf] Error 2
I tried to find user_guide.log but did not find it anywhere.
And the strange thing is: although error message notify me that the build was fail, the user_guide.pdf still generated in the _build folder.
