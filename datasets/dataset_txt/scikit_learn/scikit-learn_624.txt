This shows a link for the current stable (as it should) and a link to the 0.16 documentation, because back then we had the gridsearch module, so telling google that the standard link is our current version doesn't help because the page doesn't exist in our current version.
The same is probably true for train_test_split etc. Might be worth fixing by messing with the old website?
