I'm teaching a class where students are learning about PCA, so I pointed them to scikit-learn's implementation of PCA. However, reading the docstring, I realized that some information was missing:
Are the components in pca.components_ sorted by eiganvalues?
How do you obtain the eiganvalues corresponding to each of the components?
It turns out that this SO post answered my questions, but it might be helpful to mention these answers in the docstring.
