ParameterGrid's current implementation yields parameter combinations deterministically (up to an ordering of dict keys), meaning that for small parameter sets it's necessary to call list() followed by some shuffle() method in order to iterate randomly over parameter settings, while for large parameter spaces it's impossible to build the combinatorially-large list of parameter combinations in memory before shuffling them. It seems like ParameterGrid should be able to iterate over a random ordering of parameter combinations by simply choosing, independently and randomly, a member of the sequence provided for each parameter.
I'm new around these parts, so if something like this exists, please point me to it! Otherwise, I'm happy to take a first crack :)
