I have noticed in many places to calculate the square of an array the following idiom is used:
a **= 2
this will fail if a is a matrix, more robust (in this case) is to use:
np.exp2(a)
but when calculating sums worse occurs for matrices:
np.sum(a, axis=1).shape != np.sum(m, axis=1)
this breaks (at least) the euclideanmetric which expects (1, n) shaped normsquares
So none of this is matrix safe. Are matrices not then array-like?
