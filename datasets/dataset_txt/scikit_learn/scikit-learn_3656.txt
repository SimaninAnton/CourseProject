Hello,
I can provide a IPython notebook where I test the accuracy calculation via three methods for a MultinomialNB.
1/ .score method
2/ .predict method and then computing the mean of predictions being equal to y
3/.predict_proba and the computing of preditcions with argmax and then computing the mean of predictions being equal to y
All three are equals (as expected!) when I fitted the MultinomialNB model with .partial_fit method.
The 3/ seems to be inconsistent when I fitted the MultinomialNB model with .fit method.
Best regards
