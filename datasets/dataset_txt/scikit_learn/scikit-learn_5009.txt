Google doesn't seem to index the website very well.
Try: "random forest" or "decision tree". I would have expected the reference pages to be the top results, but it actually appears they don't even show up in the results! This makes it quite useless in my opinion.
Any way to fix this?
I think it we would be best to use Sphinx search engine instead, wouldn't it? (Like for the Python, Numpy, Scipy, etc official documentation)
