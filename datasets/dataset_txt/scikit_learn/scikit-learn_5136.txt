In this section of the documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/tree.html#classification,
there is the following code:
>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> out = StringIO()
>>> out = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=out)
for exporting the tree to Graphviz format.
I think it is unclear and doesn't give the reader the information he wanted: How to get a PDF (or PNG) with his tree.
I suggest to replace it with the following code:
>>> import StringIO, pydot
>>> dot_data = StringIO.StringIO()
>>> tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=dot_data)
>>> graph = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())
>>> graph.write_pdf("iris.pdf")
I can send a pull request, but I have two more questions:
Does scikit-learn already have a dependency on pydot?
How are the iris.svg and iris.pdf files in doc/images generated and where in the code?
