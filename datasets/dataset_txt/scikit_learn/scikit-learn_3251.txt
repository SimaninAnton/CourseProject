we currently have "n_clusters" as a criterion, and a single way to cut the tree (I'm not sure what our strategy is called). scipy implements many more strategies, in particular "distance": http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster.html#scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster
@GaelVaroquaux do we have the "inconsistent" in this nomenclature?
