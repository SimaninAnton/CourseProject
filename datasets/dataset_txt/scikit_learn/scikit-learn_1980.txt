I ran into this because I've been experimenting with a smoothed quantile loss function and was testing it against the scikit-learn implementation. It looks like there is a bug in the sklearn version. I believe the + sign here should be a -, as well as the one here. I don't believe this affects fitting, but it would potentially affect scoring.
