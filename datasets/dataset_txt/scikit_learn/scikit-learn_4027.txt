When computing roc_auc_score, I found the following code
581         if len(np.unique(y_true)) != 2:
582             raise ValueError("ROC AUC score is not defined")
I wonder does y_true have to contain 2 labels? In some case, test examples could come from only one class. In that case it should be len(np.unique(y_true)) <= 2. Of course, it might cause division of zero when compute the ROC curve. Any thoughts about this?
