The OneClassSVM is documented in the user guide twice: in the the SVM section and the outlier detection section.
The "See the user guide" link in the class is actually pointing to the SVM module docs, which is the less complete one. The SVM module docs point to the outlier detection, but not the other way around.
I'd say we should reduce the section in the SVM module to a simple "see outlier detection for one-class svm" and have the OneClassSVM docstring link to the outlier detection part of the user guide.
I think @aishgrt1 might want to take this?
