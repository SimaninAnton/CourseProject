I am not sure if I do understand the result of
g = mixture.GMM(n_components=1).fit(X)
logProb, _ = g.score_samples(X)
where the first one (logProb) should be Log probabilities of each data point in X so applying exponent I should get back probabilities as prob = numpy.exp( logProb ), right?
In this case while I have only single component I would expect that the probabilities will be in range (0,1) but some are much higher then 1. What am I doing wrong?
