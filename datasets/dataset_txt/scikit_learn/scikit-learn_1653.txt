Hello,
Thanks for your great library. I am training a model with cross_val_score and after that i execute cross_val_predict to predict unknown labels, but it returns me an error that i didn't set the optional y variable.
   scores = cross_validate(algorithm, train_x, train_y, scoring=scoring,
                               cv=10, return_train_score=True)
   cross_val_predict(algorithm, test_x)
Error message:
    TypeError: fit() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'
    Process finished with exit code 1
