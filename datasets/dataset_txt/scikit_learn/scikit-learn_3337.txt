Dear experts,
I have just started working with sklearn using simple decision trees algorithms and it looks like the training data are stored together with the classifier, as the pickle file size grows three times when training on three times more data.
Is there a way to store the bare decision tree(s) without storing the data too?
Thank you!
training and saving snippet
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, n_jobs = 5, verbose = 1)
clf.fit(X, y,weights)

training_file = './training_file/%s.pkl' % args.out
print 'Dumping training file in: ' + training_file
joblib.dump(clf, training_file, compress=True)
