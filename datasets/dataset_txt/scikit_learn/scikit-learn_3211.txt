I guess that the TSNE needs to apply dimensionality reduction on the whole data to consider the relation among all the high-dimensional vectors. If this is right, even with multiple core processors it is not sensible to parallelise by splitting the data.
Since TSNE is commonly applied on large number of high-dimensional vectors, there should be some way that multiple cores could be made use of. Or am I missing something ?. Is there any workaround internally or using some external libraries (maybe like Spark) to make use of the resources ?.
