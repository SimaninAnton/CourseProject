There should be one or two images linking to the pictures of the MLP examples
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/index.html#neural-networks
Maybe http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/index.html#neural-networks and/or http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/neural_networks/plot_mnist_filters.html
The "topic" box in the example page linking to the examples is not complete (only one listed) and the link is incorrect
There needs a big warning sign (in red, using the "warning" directive) that says that this MLP is not appliable for deep architectures or convnets, or any serious neural nets, and that points to other packages for that.
