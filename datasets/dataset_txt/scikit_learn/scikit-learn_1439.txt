In the docstring of the RobustScaler class we state that:
Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature (or each
sample, depending on the axis argument) by computing the relevant
statistics on the samples in the training set.
I can't see an axis argument in RobustScaler. In general I see that we provide an axis parameter on all scaling shortcut functions but not to their corresponding classes. Not a big deal though.
