I have a Pipeline set up very similar to the FeatureUnion with heterogeneous data sources example (http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/hetero_feature_union.html), but I'm attempting to grid-search over the different ways of weighting the transformers in the FeatureUnion:
parameters = {
    'features__transformer_weights': [{'summary_stats': 1.0, 'vocab': 0.5},
                                      {'summary_stats': 1.0, 'vocab': 1.0},
                                      {'summary_stats': 1.0, 'vocab': 0.1}]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(full_clf_with_length, parameters, n_jobs=1, verbose=1, scoring='roc_auc')
However, it looks like parameters of FeatureUnion objects aren't accessible from within a GridSearch. This would be a useful feature for me, and I'd be happy to contribute a PR if someone could point me in the right direction.
