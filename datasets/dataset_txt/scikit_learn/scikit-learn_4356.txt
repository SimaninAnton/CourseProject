The nudge_dataset function would benefit from being extracted as a helper function with an additional parameter to configure the shape. It should probably be renamed to nudge_samples_2d to highlight the fact that it interprets samples as 2D images.
This function will then be reusable to build examples for instance for the upcoming MLP class on a larger versions of the digits without having to download a large dataset such as MNIST.
