plot_sparse_coding.py:91: FutureWarning: rcond parameter will change to the default of machine precision times max(M, N) where M and N are the input matrix dimensions.
To use the future default and silence this warning we advise to pass rcond=None, to keep using the old, explicitly pass rcond=-1.
x[0, idx], _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(D[idx, :].T, y)
I have no idea where this comes from. We should investigate. It's not a parameter or SparseCoding. We shouldn't surface internal deprecations to users.
