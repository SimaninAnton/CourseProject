Running the tests highlights that we do not close file object explicitly in many places of the code. In Python 3.4+ this raises warnings such as:
scikit-learn/sklearn/datasets/base.py:1: ResourceWarning: unclosed file [...]
This is probably a matter of wrapping the code that manipulates such recently opened file objects in a with statement:
f = open(some_filename)
# do something with f
by:
with open(some_filename) as f:
    # do something with f
Run the tests with nosetests -v sklearn to find them all.
