Since we're making lots of files private, I think we can make use of this chance to get rid of some files with trailing underscore.
./covariance/_empirical_covariance_.py
./covariance/_graph_lasso_.py
./covariance/_shrunk_covariance_.py
./cross_decomposition/_cca_.py
./cross_decomposition/_pls_.py
./manifold/_spectral_embedding_.py
OK with this? @thomasjpfan
