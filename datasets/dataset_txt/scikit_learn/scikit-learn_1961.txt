I think that there is an issue with the consistency at least between the doc and the code regarding the preprocessing (scaler/normalizer)
As an example, I wanted to use StandardScaler for a 1D transform since it is stated that it should work:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#scaling-data-with-outliers (section "Scaling target variables in regression"). However, only scale is accepting a 1D.
Checking a bit more in the code, it seems that some of the object always requires 2D and sometimes, some of the functions can handle 1D.
Accept 1D:
scale
min_max_scale
max_abs_scale
Accept 2D:
functions:
robust_scale
normalize
binarize
objects:
MinMaxScaler
StandardScaler
MaxAbsScaler
RobustScaler
Normalizer
KernelCenterer
Binarizer
RobustScaler
Is it making sense to support 1D transform for: robust_scale and binarize supposing that we are provided a single feature and normalize supposing that we are given a single sample.
I also think that the documentation should be updated by modifying the section "Scaling target variables in regression" mentioning that all functions will accept 1D (if this is the case) and 2D for the objects. Additionally, i think that I could linked with #9041 to mention that we can use TransformTargetRegressor in conjunction with these functions objects (edit: this is not true, we need an estimator which will take care of the 1D to 2D transform. Sill worth mentioning that you can get a transformer + regressor out-of-the-box) (This should be added in the #9041, thought).
So it is a bit verbose, but if @jnothman @amueller @ogrisel could give their insights regarding those functions and if it is worth adding 1D transform support to them.
