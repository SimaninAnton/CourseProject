Running
pip install --pre scikit-learn
in a docker container with
docker pull giodegas/pypy-jupyter:scipy
The error:
/usr/local/site-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/externals/loky/backend/compat.py in <module>()
     10 if sys.version_info[:2] >= (3, 3):
     11     import queue

     13 else:
     14     import Queue as queue

ImportError: No module named '_pickle' 
shows up.
(you may not get the latest updated container from the docker hub site, since it is slow, I am working with a local copy).
