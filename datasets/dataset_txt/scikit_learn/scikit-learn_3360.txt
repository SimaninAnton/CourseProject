From http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
We donâ€™t recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on linux, as this will involve a lengthy build-process with many dependencies. Without careful configuration, building numpy yourself can lead to an installation that is much slower than it should be.
Is this about the installation process? That it will take longer as you need to compile everything thus will take more time? Or it's about how numpy will run after you installed? As in it will run slower due to some missing configuration on compile?
