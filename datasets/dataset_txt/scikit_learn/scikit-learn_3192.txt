Hi,
I hope you don't mind such an ask, but could you implement the following paper under scikit-learn?
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.4051&rep=rep1&type=pdf
"A complete fuzzy decision tree technique" by Cristina Olaru and Louis Wehenkel from 2003
It would be really nice as an alternative or extension for current decision tree and random forest implementations. I'm a capital letter USER (not a programmer), so I have to apologise that I can't give help.
thanks
