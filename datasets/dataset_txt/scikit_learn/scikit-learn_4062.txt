I'm trying to whiten a large dataset, but I don't want to remove any of the features as I need to reshape it afterwards. When I try to set the components to the same number as the features, IncrementalPCA returns an n_examples x n_examples transform.
X_train is a 1200 x 16521 matrix, but the transform returns a 1200 x 1200.
pca = IncrementalPCA(n_components=X_train.shape[1])
pca.fit(X_train)
X_train = pca.transform(X_train)
X_valid = pca.transform(X_valid)
