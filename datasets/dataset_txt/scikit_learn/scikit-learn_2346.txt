This needs some fixes:
http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#python-3-x-support
we don't support 2.6 3.2 or 3.3 any more
It should not read as if "Python 3 support" is a feature. It's the default. So we should probably change the title to something like "Python versions supported" or something like that. I'm ok with leaving in the hints on print and // for now.
We might consider removing this section in the future, but for now I think we should just reformulate.
