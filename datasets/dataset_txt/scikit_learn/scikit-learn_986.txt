Description
I am trying to train and save the model in a little-endian system, pickle it and load it in big-endian machine, but I am facing issues with loading it.
Digging deeper into pickle formatting revealed that pickle is independent of byte ordering for inbuilt python data types, but for 3rd party data types like sklearn pipeline, picking is done differently. Can you help me on how to save the model such that it can be trained and saved on little endian and loaded on big-endian
