Description
Vising the scikit-learn website using https is not possible and gives an error. Github pages now allows custom domains to use https so this error can be resolved. See https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/ on how to set this up.
Steps/Code to Reproduce
Manually type in "https://scikit-learn.org" into a web browser.
Expected Results
I should be able to visit the website using HTTPS without an error.
Actual Results
Going to https://scikit-learn.org generates the following error page and does not direct me to the scikit learn website (this message's wording comes from Firefox specifically):
"""
Your connection is not secure
The owner of scikit-learn.org has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website.
scikit-learn.org uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is only valid for the following names: *.github.com, github.com, *.github.io, github.io Error code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN
"""
A similar error is shown in Chromium.
