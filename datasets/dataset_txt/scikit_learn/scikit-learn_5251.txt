(This is slightly related to #857)
As part of the developer workflow, we often need to run (cd doc; make html) and scan that horrible horrible output to see if anything fails or prints nasty stuff. Not even redirecting stdout to /dev/null helps too much, since stderr is also polluted by sphinx.
Does anybody know of a precedent, or if not, can we hack together a way to run the examples as if they were a test suite, so we can have an output like .....E..?
Maybe we can do this with nose itself.
