In b500e3e and e6a464b (not yet released) we made input validation optional for pairwise_distances_argmin_min and pairwise_distances_argmin. I'm not sure I agree with that decision. I would much rather refactor the current code into private (leading _) and public functions, where the private one is the fast one. Making input validation optional makes the API heavier and is inconsistent with what we do everywhere else.
