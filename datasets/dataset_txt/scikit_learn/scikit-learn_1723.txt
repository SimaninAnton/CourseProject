In #9012 and #9041 we have found that it is hard to find a good module to make ColumnTransformer and TransformedTargetRegressor home. We also have the potential to hinge the updating of Pipeline's interface as per #8350 upon the creation of a new module (deprecating sklearn.pipeline very slowly!).
Firstly, we should discuss whether this is the right thing to do. Secondly, I and others can create some proposals for names below and the comments can get thumbs up from contributors and spectators who have an opinion! (Not that we intend to be democratic about it, but can get some idea of consensus.)
