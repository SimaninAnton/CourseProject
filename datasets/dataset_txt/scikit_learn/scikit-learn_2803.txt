Remove the california housing dataset from ~/scikit_learn_data and then:
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
fetch_california_housing()
It looks like this link works:
http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/houses.zip
and corresponds to the old format so we may just need to revert 3daab8a.
