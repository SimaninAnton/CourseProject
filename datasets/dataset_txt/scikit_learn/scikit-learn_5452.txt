I was writing a simple classifier using GP (one vs all)
Using the iris data set.
iris=load_iris()
Y=np.array(iris.target)
x=np.array(iris.data)
y1=np.copy(Y)
y1[:50]=np.ones(50) #For the first one vs all
y1[50:]=np.zeros(100) 
gp = GaussianProcess(theta0=5e-1)
gp.fit(x,y1)
If you run this, you'll get the exception
Exception: Multiple X are not allowed
It took me a while to figure out it refers to the fact that multiple X's have the same value (the iris data set has only one significant digit, thus multiple inputs have the same value)
Unless you go into the code, you don't even figure if X refers to the features or the classes.
I think the notation could be improved to something like:
"Multiple input features cannot have the same value"
Thanks
