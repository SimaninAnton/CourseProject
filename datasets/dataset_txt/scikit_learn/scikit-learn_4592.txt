Example behavior:
>>> X = np.array(['No', 'Yes'], dtype=np.dtype('O'))
>>> utils.multiclass.type_of_target(X)
'unknown'
It does this because of explicit rule y.dtype == object that means type is unknown. Is there is a reason for that? Character variable can be used successfully to build a model (tested with RandomForest / GradientBoosting) but then score fails because of this behaviour.
