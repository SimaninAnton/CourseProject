Follow up on #11190:
It would be great to provide built-in ways to select different types of columns, particularly categorical and continuous ones.
It's a bit tricky how to detect that, but we could add some factory functions, for example with an argument on how to interpret integers.
Btw, I'm also working on a preprocessing tool that tries to do this very automagically but I haven't had time to finish / publish it.
