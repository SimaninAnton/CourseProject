Hi!
As the title says, the Bernoulli RBM doesn't work with sparse input when verbose = True.
To see this, just do:
from sklearn.neural_network import BernoulliRBM
from scipy.sparse import csc_matrix
rbm = BernoulliRBM(n_components=2, batch_size=2, verbose=True)
X = csc_matrix([[0.], [1.]])
rbm.fit(X)
