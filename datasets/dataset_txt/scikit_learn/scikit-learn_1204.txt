Was looking at commit ( a52053d ) recently where check_array calls were added in sparse_encode for the dictionary and X. Assuming I'm not missing anything, which I could be, these checks are unnecessary.
In the case of X, this is taken from X_train, which already meets the requirements (i.e. double precision and C-ordered). The dictionary similarly should meet these requirements (i.e. double precision and Fortran-ordered, but we pass its transpose so C-ordered).
Given this, would it make sense to drop those checks? Or am I missing something?
