Sometimes input validation is expensive and consumes a major portion of the time.
It might be helpful to have private methods that do not do any input validation with the public methods doing input_validation and wrappers around these private methods.
Example:
If we find check_X_y is consuming a major portion of time in A and is being used in B. It might be helpful to do this.
def _A(X, y):
    # do stuff
    return

def A(X, y):
    check_X_y(X, y)
    _A(X, y)

def B(X, y):
    check_X_y(X, y)
    for i in range(10):
        _A(X, y)
instead of validating input multiple times.
