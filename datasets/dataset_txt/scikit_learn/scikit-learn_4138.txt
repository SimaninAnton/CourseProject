I think it is worth adjusting the DBSCAN documentation to note that if you ask DBSCAN to calculate pairwise distances for you, then it will do so using only one core.
If you want to take advantage of multiple cores, you should pre-calculate a distance matrix using pairwise_distances(n_jobs=) and then run DBSCAN with your pre-calculated distance matrix.
