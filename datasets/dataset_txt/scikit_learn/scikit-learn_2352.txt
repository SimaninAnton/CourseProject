There are currently plenty of deprecation warnings in the tests, in particular on newer numpy, as you can see in the travis output.
We should fix these issues whenever possible by not using deprecated behavior, or by catching the deprecation warning (if it's something that we deprecated, and not a third-party library that we're using).
