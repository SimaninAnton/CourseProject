Description
Documentation for utility functions check_array() and check_X_y() is outdated, stating that they convert input to a 2d array. This is not the case for 1D to 2D conversion since sklearn 0.19. Those functions instead raise an exception requiring that conversion to 2D be carried out manually. Only check_array() argument description reflects the new behaviour.
check_array() docs:
By default, the input is converted to an at least 2D numpy array.
Parameters:
  ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
    Whether to raise a value error if X is not 2d.
check_X_y() docs:
Checks X and y for consistent length, enforces X 2d and y 1d.
Parameters:
  ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
    Whether to make X at least 2d.
Utilities for Developers:
check_array: convert input to 2d array, raise error on sparse matrices. Allowed
sparse matrix formats can be given optionally, as well as allowing 1d or nd arrays.
