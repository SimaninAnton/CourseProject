The RadiusNeighborClassifier outlier_label parameter is set to None by default. The predict method checks if an outlier_label is provided using:
if self.outlier_label:
This evaluates to False if the outlier_label is set to 0. As far as I know 0 is generally used as label, so the test should probably check if self.outlier is not None.
