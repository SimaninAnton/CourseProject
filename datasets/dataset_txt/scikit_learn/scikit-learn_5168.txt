In certain situations, ExtraTrees behave differently from RandomForests.
When no progress can be made on a dataset using a single split, ExtraTrees don't grow at all (at least this is my diagnosis at the moment).
This gist illustrates the problem.
I'd really prefer the ExtraTrees to just pick a random split (which I guess is what the random forests do).
I am not terribly familiar with the tree building code.
Could someone else maybe have a look?
