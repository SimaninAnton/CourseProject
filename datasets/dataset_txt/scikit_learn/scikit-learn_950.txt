Could someone with admin rights please disable LGTM.com comments on PRs? Cf section "Configuring pull request integration" in https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-pr-integration
Maybe there was an earlier issue about this, but searching for LGTM.com in issues just produces noise at this point (because of automated LGTM.com comments).
These repeated comments in WIP PRs are quite annoying. #12319 includes ~2 dozen of them and I remember @amueller also complaining about it in some other PR.
IMO CI status is enough.
