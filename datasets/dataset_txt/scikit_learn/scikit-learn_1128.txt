I have looked through the docs, but cannot find instructions on the best way to generate cython c source when installing sklearn from source.
What to do:
Download sklearn source and untar it to sklearn_dir.
Edit some .pyx file or another
$ cd sklearn_dir
$ pip3 install --user -U .
Observe that the related .c files are unchanged, and that the scikit learn installation does not reflect your changes.
Possibly an instruction for this should be included in the "building from source" docs?
