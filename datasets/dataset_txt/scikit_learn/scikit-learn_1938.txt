    stats = []
    for ii in range(0, len(statistics)-1):
        stats.append((data[ii] - data[ii+1], statistics[ii] - statistics[ii+1]))
    x = np.reshape(stats, (-1,1))
    km = KMeans()
    km.fit(stats)
when data do not change
k means label change from one row to next row, this change is also change in every run
can not believe in result
