In the readme, the link for "releases" points to https://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/. It doesn't seem to be updated for 17.1, and I find it a bit odd since we also have releases on github here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/releases.
Additionally, sourceforge has a pretty shady history of bundling malware with downloads. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-plus-plus-leaves-sf.html.
Is there a reason that the readme links to sourceforge, or have we switched over to github? If its the latter case, I'd be happy to open a PR to amend the error.
