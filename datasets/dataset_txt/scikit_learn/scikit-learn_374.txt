For _get_missing_features_info's docstring:
scikit-learn/sklearn/impute/_base.py
Lines 513 to 527 in 0104487
         Parameters 
         ---------- 
         X : {ndarray or sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples, n_features) 
             The input data with missing values. Note that ``X`` has been 
             checked in ``fit`` and ``transform`` before to call this function. 
            Returns 
         ------- 
         imputer_mask : {ndarray or sparse matrix}, shape \ 
 (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_features_with_missing) 
             The imputer mask of the original data. 
            features_with_missing : ndarray, shape (n_features_with_missing) 
             The features containing missing values. 
   The imputer_mask will always have the shape of X.
features_with_missing will have the shape of either be n_features or n_features_with_missing.
