The properties for accessing attributes on Tree return arrays which don't own their data, and which are malloced and freed by the tree. Therefore:
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
c = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit([[1,2]], [1])
cl = c.tree_.children_left
print(cl)
del c
print(cl)
cl[0] = 1
outputs
[-1]
[-849416680]
