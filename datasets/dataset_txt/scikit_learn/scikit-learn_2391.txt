Description
I got this warning in a gridSearchCV task and it is a regression task, the "only-1-member-label" may should not display in the regression mode.
/Users/fupeng/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:516: Warning: The least populated class in y has only 1 members, which is too few. The minimum number of labels for any class cannot be less than n_folds=3.
