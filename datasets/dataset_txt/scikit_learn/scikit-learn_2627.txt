Currently AdaBoost* requires X to be an array or sparse matrix of numerics. However, since the data is not processed directly by AdaBoost* but by its base estimator (on which fit, predict_proba and predict may be called), we should not need to constrain the data that much, allowing for X to be a list of text blobs or similar.
Similar may apply to other ensemble methods.
