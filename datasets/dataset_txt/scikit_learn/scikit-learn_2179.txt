In order to learn the details of the one class model, I want to know how to reprogram the decision function in sklearn. I checked the decision function here[https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/svm/base.py#L419]. Followed by the function, I found svm_csr_predict_values[https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f65d144e3966113d3daec836e443c6d7a5b/sklearn/svm/src/libsvm/svm.h], but there is no definition in this repository.
I also checked the libsvm source code [https://github.com/arnaudsj/libsvm/blob/master/svm.cpp], but got nothing. Also there are no strong relations between these two repositories.
I also tried to rebuild the decision function like this:
model = OneClassSVM(kernel='rbf', nu=0.1, gamma=0.1)
model.fit(X)
ssum = model.intercept_[0]
for i in range(len(model.dual_coef_.toarray()[0])):
    ssum += model.dual_coef_.toarray()[0][i] * ((35-model.support_vectors_[i,0])**2 + (40-model.support_vectors_[i,1])**2)
print math.exp(0.1*ssum-.1)
where the number 35 and 40 are picked to test the result.
Is there any mistakes within the codes??
Or have this code not been uploaded?
Many Thanks!
