binary_roc_auc_score has a misleading error message. "Is not defined" sounds like it is not implemented or something similar, where actually it's a data problem, namely that there is less or more than 2 distinct labels in the y. The error message should say this.
    def _binary_roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score, sample_weight=None):
        if len(np.unique(y_true)) != 2:
            raise ValueError("ROC AUC score is not defined")
