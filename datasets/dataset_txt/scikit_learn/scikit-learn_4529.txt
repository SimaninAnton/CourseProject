I was trying to train a RandomForest on a float64 matrix. This matrix contains items too large to be represented by float32. I pass this matrix to the RandomForest.fit function, and it falls with a NaN/inf error because the matrix gets recast as a float32 matrix.
There is currently no parameter support to allow for 64bit random forests or something like that. I'm on a 64bit platform (Mac 10.9), so I'm minorly surprised it's not float64 default anyway...
