VotingClassifier provides named_estimators which is a dict of constituent estimators before fitting (i.e. the estimators are cloned and individually fit when the VotingClassifier is fit). These are already accessible through get_params(). More useful would be a named_estimators_ or similar containing the fitted estimators from estimators_.
