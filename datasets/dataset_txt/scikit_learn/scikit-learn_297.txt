I want to use LocalOutlierFactor.fit_predict to collect an array of labels (-1 for anomalous and +1 for normal instances). I want to use labels array in silhouette_score () to evaluate the model performance. However, scikit-learn is complaining like this:
"ValueError: Number of labels is 1. Valid values are 2 to n_samples - 1 (inclusive)"
This shows that it can not produce array of labels instead it is combining all/unsigned ones(1) as a single-element array.
Could someone help with a few tips on how to resolve this issue?
Thank you in advance!
It is about identifying anomalous consumption records in a bunch of datasets
def silFunction(3d-numpyArray):
X = 3d-numpyArray[:, subS_, :]
labels = localOutlierFactor.fit_predict(X)
silhouette = silhouette_score(X, labels, metric='euclidean')
return silhouette
I was expecting the mean silhouette score, but it is producing an error message
"ValueError: Number of labels is 1. Valid values are 2 to n_samples - 1 (inclusive)"
