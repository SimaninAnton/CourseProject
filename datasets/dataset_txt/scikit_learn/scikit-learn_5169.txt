In recent versions of nose, the options NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE and ELLIPSIS can be set globally. That would be awesome.
This is only available in nose 1.2, though. As removing the flags inline would break them on older versions, I'm not sure we can ever make the switch :-/
Should we try to monkey-patch?
