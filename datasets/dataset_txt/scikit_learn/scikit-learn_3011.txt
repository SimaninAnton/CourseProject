Try pip install scikit-learn. First reaction: yay, there are Linux wheels! Second reaction: boooo, they don't work:
>>> import sklearn
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sklearn/__init__.py", line 57, in <module>
    from .base import clone
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sklearn/base.py", line 8, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ImportError: No module named 'numpy'
Also:
>>> import sklearn.externals
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sklearn/__init__.py", line 56, in <module>
    from . import __check_build
ImportError: cannot import name '__check_build'
If people are installing wheels, then you shouldn't assume that they have numpy or scipy installed already (I'm seeing this particularly in a Docker build). It is 2016: why do we still have totally broken Python packages?!
