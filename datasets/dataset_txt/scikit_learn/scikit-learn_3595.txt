I got a mistake when I rebuilding the scikit-learn after fetch the upstream.
It returns message like this:
rm -f tags
python setup.py clean
Partial import of sklearn during the build process.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "setup.py", line 247, in
setup_package()
File "setup.py", line 201, in setup_package
from setuptools import setup

packaging = pkg_resources.packaging
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'packaging'
make: *** [clean] mistake 1
Anyone can help?
Thx
