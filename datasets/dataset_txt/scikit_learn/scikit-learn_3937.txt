They say "LogisticRegressionCV implements Logistic Regression with builtin cross-validation to find out the optimal C parameter. In general the “newton-cg” and “lbfgs” solvers are found to be faster due to warm-starting. "
Looking into the PR, I think what it should say is "are faster for high-dimensional dense data" not "in general".
