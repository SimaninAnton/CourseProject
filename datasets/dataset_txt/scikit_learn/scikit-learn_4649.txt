Hi,
the fit method from ElasticNet in coordinate_descent.py got it's coef_init parameter removed. The warning suggests to look at enet_path, although this is odd since this method does not allow to specifying a start point either. Manually setting ElasticNet.coef_ prior to fitting does not help either, the array is set to zero.
Additionally, the constructor of ElasticNet has a warm start parameter (False by default) which is completely unused, which is confusing.
It seems like the option to use warm start and elasticnets was lost in the refactoring process. Was this done accidentally or on purpose?
