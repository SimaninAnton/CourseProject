I read in the documentation that sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier uses an optimized version of the CART algorithm, but according to Wikipedia, there are several variants of CART. In fact, as far as I understand, one could argue that RandomForests (which has it's own method in sklearn).
It would be helpful to know which type of CART sklearn uses. For example, Random Forests directly consider the out of bag error, reducing the need for cross validation. Is this the case for sklearn's CART as well?
