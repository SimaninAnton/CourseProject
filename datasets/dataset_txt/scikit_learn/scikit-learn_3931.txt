We've discussed at various points our opposition to a ragbag of algorithms being included either in scikit-learn or in a monolithic contrib/extras package. We have also discussed facilitating this by making some of sklearn.utils explicitly public (and hence with compatibility assurances), and perhaps by making it easy to bootstrap creation of addon projects in terms of cloning a repository that enables a common testing and documentation framework.
I thought this deserved an issue to track ideas and progress (feel free to note related issues and PRs).
I think this would be a great candidate for a GSoC project, although it missed 2015. The project can be further extended to include reengineering existing extensions to be compatible with the toolkit, and making a gallery of addon estimators on scikit-learn.org via their compiled examples.
