I'm trying to run TSNE with a custom metric function. My data is represented a list of numpy arrays of different length (which my metric function is perfectly capable of handling). However, TSNE throws a ValueError at me from line 693 of t_sne.py because my data cannot be made into a numpy array with dtype np.float32 of np.float64.
I don't see any fundamental reason for this requirement, as it excludes valid use cases such as mine. Can this be modified so that more general cases are allowed?
