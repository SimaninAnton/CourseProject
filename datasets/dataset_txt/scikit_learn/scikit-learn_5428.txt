I found that the pickle file of sparse linearSVC became irrational larger after shifting the index of features.
I had trained a series of models using window of tokens in natural language processing. The pickle files are less than 10M with 20,000~50,000 dense features. In order to create a flexible approach, I shifted the index of features to left by 9 bits, and all the new pickle files have the same size 582M. It seems that all the void feature weights were saved. Can we just save the useful data?
