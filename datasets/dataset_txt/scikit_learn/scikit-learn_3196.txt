When training a classifier, in my case a simplesvm.SVCclassifier, we can use strings as class labels instead of +1/-1 or 1/0. This seems to work just fine - when applying the predict method, a list of string class labels are returned. However, using strings for class labels fails when using metrics.roc_curve, for example, which requires an int to be used as class labels.
Would it be advantageous to allow for strings to be used in metric and other methods?
