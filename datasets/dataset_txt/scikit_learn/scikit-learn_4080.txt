Numpy has split off their docstring processing into a separate project at https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc. Scikit-learn has a local copy which has diverged, due to stylistic fixes as well as some new feature or data checking needs.
Our copy should be re-synced with the numpydoc project, such that we benefit from any cleaning there, so that our changes contribute back to that project, allowing other numpydoc-using projects to benefit from our enhancements.
