See SO.
Setting intercept_scaling=0 changes the shape of coef_ so the estimator can not be used.
I am a bit surprised that the coef_ is reduced by two features, but that seems to be the case. One fore each class? I'm not sure what is happening in liblinear here. I guess the easiest would be to raise on our side, as the combination with fit_intercept=True is nonsensical.
