Quoting from Breiman's web-page:
"the raw importance score for variable m ... If the values of this score from tree to tree are independent, then the standard error can be computed by a standard computation. The correlations of these scores between trees have been computed for a number of data sets and proved to be quite low, therefore we compute standard errors in the classical way, divide the raw score by its standard error to get a z-score, and assign a significance level to the z-score assuming normality"
See here: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#varimp
It seems like an easy addition and it can be very useful, when assessing which features are more important than others, a confidence interval can be quite handy.
Thanks!
