Hi,
I'm curious for IDF calculations (sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py) line 978
In 0.9, the formula for calculating IDF is log(n_samples/ (df + 1)), then in 16.0 the formula become log((n_samples + 1) / (df + 1)) + 1.
According to the Cornell SMART system, the formula of IDF is log((n_samples + 1) / (df + 1)). So, may I know the reason or reference paper for adding another +1 at the end of formula?
*smooth_idf = True
