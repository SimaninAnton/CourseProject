As emphasized by this question on stackoverflow RandomizedPCA.explained_variance_ratio_ is false as it cannot cheaply estimate the total variance of the input data.
I did a notebook to check that this is actually a bug.
I think we should:
1- plainly remove explained_variance_ratio_ from the RandomizedPCA class (and document the removal in whats_new.rst)
2- write an example that demonstrates how to compute the explained variance empirically for PCA, RandomizedPCA, TruncatedSVD with plots similar to my notebook
3- add a new section to the narrative documentation of the TruncatedSVD model to explain that and include the plot.
Let me put that as Easy fix suitable for first time contributor.
