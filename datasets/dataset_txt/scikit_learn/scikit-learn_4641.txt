A change in April (eae18a3) seems to have caused partial_fit in MultinomialNB to stop resolving. That change was made in reference to issue 1829.
from sklearn import naive_bayes
naive_bayes.MultinomialNB().partial_fit(X, Y, classes=[0,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
AttributeError: 'MultinomialNB' object has no attribute 'partial_fit'
If I change line 36 in sklearn/naive_bayes.py from
class BaseNB(six.with_metaclass(ABCMeta, BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin)):
to
class BaseNB(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
The function can be found.
