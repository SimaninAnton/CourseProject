Building failed on a Solaris system with the following error:
sklearn/utils/src/cholesky_delete.c:55:13: error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before numeric constant
There's also same error reported for Cygwin:

It turns out in cholesky_delete.c it has a variable named _L, but the _L is defined somewhere as a macro, put a #undef _L fixes the build error. But a proper fix should be rename the _L to something else..
