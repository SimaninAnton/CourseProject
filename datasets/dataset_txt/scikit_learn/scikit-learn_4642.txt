SGDClassifier.fit calls set_coef which transforms the coef array into fortran layout for faster prediction time. Partial fit does not do this (thus slower at prediction).
Partial fit does not transform from fortran to c in the first place which leads to an exception if you call partial_fit after fit for a multi-class problem.
Fixes: Either transform fortran back to c at the beginning of partial_fit or don't assume c-style arrays in plain_sgd but rather memory views.
