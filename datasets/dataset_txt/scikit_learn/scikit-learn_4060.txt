The signature of MDS is
fit_transform(self, X, init=None, y=None)
which messes a bit with pipelines and automatic testing.
Pipelines assume that the second parameter to fit is y. As MDS doesn't have atransform, I guess it is useless with pipelines anyhow.
Still that seems to be a slightly tricky issue, which might come up again in the future.
