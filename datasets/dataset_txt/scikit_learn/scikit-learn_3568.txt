Hello,
I realize scikitlearn is focused on machine learning/prediction and not inference, but has there been thought of providing some facilities for the latter?
For example, the inclusion of a generic TMLE module can provide statistical paremeters/ causal inference for scikitlearn models hopefully without too much extra machinery.

It might have a high payoff for scikitlearn to support this unification of stats and ml.
