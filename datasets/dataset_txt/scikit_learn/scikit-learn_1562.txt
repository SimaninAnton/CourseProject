I'm wondering it it would be worth compiling Cython code with the annotate -a flag in Circle CI and storing the resulting html files as artefacts. This way one could directly view the generated C code in a PR for changed files, without the need to compile locally as it's currently done for the docs thanks to @lesteve 's plugin. This could be useful to see parts of the code that should be typed etc.
This could be done by setting,
import Cython.Compiler.Options
Cython.Compiler.Options.annotate = True
in setup.py if some environment variable is present. What do you think?
