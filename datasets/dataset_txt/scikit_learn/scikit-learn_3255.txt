I guess I'm hitting some boundary case, but I'm a bit confused by this:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_lfw_people
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
people = fetch_lfw_people(min_faces_per_person=20, resize=0.7)

mask = np.zeros(people.target.shape, dtype=np.bool)
for target in np.unique(people.target):
    mask[np.where(people.target == target)[0][:50]] = 1

X_people = people.data[mask]
y_people = people.target[mask]

X_people = X_people / 255.

dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=10, min_samples=5)
labels = dbscan.fit_predict(X_people)
print(np.bincount(labels + 1))
[ 894 1168 1]
The second cluster has only one sample, but min_samples=5. Doesn't that mean that the cluster should have at least 5 samples?
