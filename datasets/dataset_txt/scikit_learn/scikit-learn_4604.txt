In [1]: from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

In [2]: recall_score([0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0])
/Users/mblondel/Desktop/projects/scikit-learn/sklearn/metrics/metrics.py:1550: UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 due to no predicted samples
Out[2]: 0.0
recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Here TP = 0 and FN = 2 so the result should be 0 without warning.
