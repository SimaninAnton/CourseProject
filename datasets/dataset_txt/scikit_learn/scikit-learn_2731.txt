Running HashingVectorizer().fit_transform('hello world') does not raise an exception. It should. The user is likely to be misled to think that it is processing the words, but in fact it's treating each character as a separate document, tokenizing with the criterion that each token should have at least two chars, and hence returning an empty matrix.
While CountVectorizer().fit_transform('hello world') raises an error, it is an "Empty vocabulary" error, which seems a bit of a strange way to tell the user what they did wrong.
Please raise a ValueError and test for an appropriate error message in fit, fit_transform and transform
