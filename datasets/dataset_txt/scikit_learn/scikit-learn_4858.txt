Thank you for providing this great python machine learning program.
I installed scikit-learn today on
Ubuntu 13.04 desktop 64bit
by following this command:
apt-get install python-sklearn
However, the test command nosetests sklearn --exe gave an error:
ERROR: Check that primal coef modification are not silently ignored
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nose/case.py", line 197, in runTest

Please give me some advise. Thanks.
