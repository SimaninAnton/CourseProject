So, why does scrapy raise ValueError when you gave <a> tag without href to response.follow(), why not just ignore those?
As far as my understanding goes a tags without href is still completely valid, so this behaviour looks strange to me.
The href attribute on a and area elements is not required; when those elements do not have href attributes they do not create hyperlinks.
