I rewrote the start_requests method, such as :
def start_requests(self):
for (click_type, url, css_path) in self.start_urls:
print (url)
yield Request(url, callback=self.loop_parse, dont_filter=True)
The effect of execution under Python 2.7 is as follows:
"
http://www.flyme.cn
https://cloud.flyme.cn
http://www.meizu.com
http://open.flyme.cn
https://member.meizu.com/uc/webjsp/member/detail
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
http://app.meizu.com/apps/public/index
"
But it got stuck behind http://www.flyme.cn at Python 3.6 , Only one request can be sent at a time
