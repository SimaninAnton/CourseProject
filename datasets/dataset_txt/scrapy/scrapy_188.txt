https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcache does let readers know they could implement custom HTTP cache storage backend and cache policy, but provides no information about the API. I would like to work on documenting it. Should I go ahead?
