I would like to use Rule to track the Splash rendering Response!
But using SplashRequest, Rule does not take effect.
Then use the rule of the process_request, re-set the Request object URL, written into the Splash HTTP API request.
`class MySpider(CrawlSpider):
name = 'innda'

def start_requests(self):
    yield Request(url)
    

rules = (
    Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=('node_\d+\.htm',)), process_request='splash_request', follow=True),
    Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=('content_\d+\.htm',)), callback="one_parse")
)


def splash_request(self, request):
    request = request.replace(url=RENDER_HTML_URL + request.url)
    return request
`
But the relative path URL is replaced by the Splash url.
What is the solution
