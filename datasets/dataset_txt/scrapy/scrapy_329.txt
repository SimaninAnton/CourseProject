I was curious as to why the documentation explicitely suggests Learn Python The Hard Way in the tutorial-section, especially since it links to the Python 2 version of the book.
I certainly don't want to discredit the book as a learning resource, but since it has received quite some criticism before (and after) its Python 3 edition, I am skeptical of endorsing only this book in the tutorial.
Without cluttering the documentation and enabling some sort paralysis by analysis I would suggest adding either or both of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python or How To Think Like a Computer Scientist from the list of Python resources for non-programmers to the documentation directly instead of only through the link to the Python resources.
