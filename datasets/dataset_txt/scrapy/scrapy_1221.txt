I am trying to use telnet for scrapy, and I type in:
telnet localhost 6023
and I have the following results coming from terminal:
Trying ::1...
telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Then it stucks here, can anyone help me?
