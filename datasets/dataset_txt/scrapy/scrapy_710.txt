Hello,
I followed https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#custom-project-commands to add my custom command. I've set COMMANDS_MODULE=linkedin_scraper.commands. Unfortunately no new commands are present in scrapy -h output nor in scrapy commands.
I've done some debugging and it seems that in _get_commands_dict function custom settings are not available yet so Scrapy does not know anything about my custom commands module.
I have this project structure:
.

├── docker-compose.yml

│   ├── __pycache__

I tired with Scrapy 1.3.0 and 1.2.2.
