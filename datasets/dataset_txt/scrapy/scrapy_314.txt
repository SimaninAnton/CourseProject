Test suite under windows fails to remove a file at https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3315/files#diff-0f004a6e06393cc5e29012b83956eed2L245 because FeedExporter instances keeps an open file descriptor created for the test case.
We need to find the leak and close the file descriptor properly on close_spider signal.
