I am not sure, how to user signals API. For example, I have a spider
from scrapy.xlib.pydispatch import dispatcher

class PageSpider(CrawlSpider):

    def __init__(self):
        dispatcher.connect(self.spider_closed, signals.spider_closed)
        # some code

    def spider_closed(self, spider):
        # some code
And I have a control script
s = get_project_settings()
process = CrawlerProcess(s)
for spider in spider_list:
    process.crawl(spider)
process.start()
Can I use SignalManager to catch if spider is closed? Or this is impossible?
