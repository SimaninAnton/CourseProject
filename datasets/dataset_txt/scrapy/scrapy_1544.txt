The process_request(self, request, spider) method of DownloaderMiddleware document that:
      "If it returns a Request object, the returned request will be rescheduled (in the Scheduler) to 
be downloaded in the future. The callback of the original request will always be called. If the new
 request has a callback it will be called with the response downloaded, and the output of that 
callback will then be passed to the original callback. If the new request doesnâ€™t have a callback, the 
response downloaded will be just passed to the original request callback."
But actually is that if it returns a Request object,then the original request will be dropped, so you must make sure that the new request object's callback is the original callback.
