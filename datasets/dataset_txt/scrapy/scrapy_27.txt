Some settings, like LOG_FORMATTER, expect a import string as value.
I think it would be great if they also allowed the corresponding object itself.
For example, let users that are doing this:
    class LogFormatter:
        pass

    class MySpider:
        custom_settings = {'LOG_FORMATTER': 'my_project.spiders.my_spider.LogFormatter'}
To do this instead:
    class LogFormatter:
        pass

    class MySpider:
        custom_settings = {'LOG_FORMATTER': LogFormatter}
