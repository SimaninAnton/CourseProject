Every now and then the Travis build fails on tests.test_crawler.CrawlerRunnerTestCase.test_deprecated_attribute_spiders, I'm not sure why.
Some examples:
https://travis-ci.org/scrapy/scrapy/jobs/582184413#L407
https://travis-ci.org/scrapy/scrapy/jobs/580207692#L419
https://travis-ci.org/scrapy/scrapy/jobs/584701732#L415
https://travis-ci.org/scrapy/scrapy/jobs/584762868#L418
PS: Sorry, I feel bad for ignoring the bug report template, but I felt like it didn't apply in this case.
