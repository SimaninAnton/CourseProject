Hi
Before I was use scrapy version "Scrapy v 0.24" and use the below method for collect the spider status
    def insertStats(self,spider,spider_stats):
        d = self.dbpool.runInteraction(self.stats_spider_closed, spider, spider_stats)
        return d

    def stats_spider_closed(self,conn, spider, spider_stats):
But now i updated to Scrapy v 1.0 , and now i receive the error like this, how can resolve it.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/internet/defer.py", line 150, in maybeDeferred
    result = f(*args, **kw)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scrapy/xlib/pydispatch/robustapply.py", line 57, in robustApply
    return receiver(*arguments, **named)
TypeError: insertStats() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)
