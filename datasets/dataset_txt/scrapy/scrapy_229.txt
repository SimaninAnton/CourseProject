Hello Mentors and Developers,
I am Manav Mehta, a student at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. I went through the Scrapy GSoC ideas page and found all the projects to be very interesting.
I would love to contribute to Scrapy and participate in GSoC 2019.
I do have some open source experience and I would like to try my hand by implementing a small new feature and/or resolving bugs.
I will be extremely thankful if someone could guide me regarding the same.
Thanking you.
Regards,
Manav Mehta.
