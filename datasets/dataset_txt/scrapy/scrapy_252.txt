I have created one scrapy project it is working well, I wanted it to host on the server to run it daily and it is working, But my server has two Network Card one is specially added for scrapy, still project is working but I wanted to use only one Network Card for scrapy or python and that I can specify that this Network card Python or Scrapy can use.
Server: Windows 10
Python: 3.6
Scrapy: 1.5
I was looking for the solution and found this Python sends an HTTP request using the specified network card on the internet but actually, I did not understand how it can be used.
Please help me to solve this solution may be like assign Network Card to python or assign Network card to socket or core library that scrapy used to request the website.
