Though the wisdom of this functionality is unclear,
it would make sense if setting DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT to zero, or None would in fact mean 'infinite' in accordance with other settings such as CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT, CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT et cetera.
The current ScrapyAgent source reads
timeout = request.meta.get('download_timeout') or self._connectTimeout
where zero and None are false and invoke self._connectTimeout instead.
Aside from this, reactor.callLater(0, ...) would mean "asap" instead of "never", so this would need a different codepath.
