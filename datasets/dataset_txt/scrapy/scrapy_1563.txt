I am using scrapy to downlaod the images from site using image pipeline.
The images are downloaded but animated gif have become static gif . those images are not animated any more.
how can i retain the animated gif after downloading
This is my pipeline
class MyImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):

    # name download version
    def image_key(self, url):
        image_guid = url.split('/')[-1]
        return 'full/%s' % (image_guid)

    def get_media_requests(self, item, info):
        if item['image_urls']:
        for image_url in item['image_urls']:
            yield Request(image_url)
