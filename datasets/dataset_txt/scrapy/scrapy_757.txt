This param (CLOSESPIDER_ERRORCOUNT) only works for exceptions in spider's callbacks, but doesn't work for item pipelines, downloader middlewares etc.
Could you mention this (expected?) behavior in docs?
Also I'm wondering, what is a conventional way to stop spider on any exception in middlewares/pipelines?
