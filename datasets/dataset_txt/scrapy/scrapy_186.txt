Hello guys,
as the title says, scrapy returns wrong datetime, I have run scrapy shell into my project and checked datetime there.
In [222]: from datetime import datetime
In [224]: datetime.now()
Out[224]: datetime.datetime(2019, 3, 22, 17, 55, 29, 265411)
and when I check the machine time, it returns the correct time
$ date
Fri Mar 22 18:55:30 CET 2019
and when I check python shell
datetime.datetime(2019, 3, 22, 18, 57, 4, 58497)
as you can see the Scrapy datetime returns -1h
My Environment:
Scrapy 1.5.1
Python 2.7.6
Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr
