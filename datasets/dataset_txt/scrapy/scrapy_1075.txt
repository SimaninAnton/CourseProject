Outsourcing a discussion from #1605 here: Should from_settings() constructors in pipelines/extensions/middlewares be deprecated?
With the exception of spider loaders, Scrapy only instantiates components when the crawler object is already available. from_settings() constructors are not really documented, besides for the spider loader API and the MailSender extension, and their support is inconsistent (e.g. spiders cannot provide from_settings() constructors).
Are there use cases where middlewares etc. need to be instantiated with settings, but without a crawler?
