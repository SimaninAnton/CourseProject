When a Request subclass (e.g. FormRequest) is sent to a disk queue a bare Request is what you get back.
This is inconvenient for scrapy-splash: Splash requests all have Splash URL as request.url, but for logging it is nice to display the requested URL, not only Splash URL. In scrapy-splash this is implemented by changing __repr__ in a Request subclass, but it works only when request is kept in memory.
