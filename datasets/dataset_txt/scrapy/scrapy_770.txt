Hi,everyone
I need scrapy a website,and It used aspx,
at first ,I used selenium,and it works fine,but too slow
,so I analysis the request head in chrome dev,
and I found how to structure the head to get the content I need,but it need post both data and cookies,
I used requests and it works fine,but I need to do it in scrapy
I googled before,but it seems if you use Request(...),it can't post data, on the other hand ,if you use Formrequest,it can't have cookies
Now,I'm confused,and don't know what to do
Is that I misunderstood the meaning of these two method?
Help please!
