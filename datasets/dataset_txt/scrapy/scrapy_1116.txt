What about removing --lsprof option and the bundled lsprofcalltree.py library? They are untested (see #1417), undocumented, don't work in Python 3, and there are easier to setup profiler UIs than KCacheGrind (e.g. https://github.com/jiffyclub/snakeviz) which work with .prof files directly.
I think we don't even have to deprecate it because removing this feature can't break user code.
