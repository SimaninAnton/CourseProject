I think the main issue with existing tutorial is that it doesn't show how to follow links and how start_requests work, relying on parse convention instead. The "under the hood" explanation is not enough IMHO. Users may think the only (or the blessed) way to write spiders that need to follow links is a CrawlSpider, and Spider is just for scraping data from a single webpage or from a static list of webpages (start_urls).
What do you think about extending the example with some link following code?
