I am using Scrapy to deep copy some content on one page, to crawl the content and download the images in that content and update the image original value accordingly.
For example I have:
<div class="A">
    <img original="example1.com/1/1.png"></img>
</div>
I need to download the image and update the new image original value（for example to mysite.com/1/1.png）, then save the content.
what I will have finally is:
<div class="A">
    <img original="mysite.com/1/1.png"></img>
</div>
and image on my disk.
Is it possible to modify the value through Selector?
Or must I download the image first and update the "original" value separately? any better solution?
