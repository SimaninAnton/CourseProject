Web servers should use encoded URLs in their "Location" headers, but they don't always do.
This website for example, for this URL http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/
redirects to www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/اعزام-كوهنوردان-ايراني-به-كيليمانجارو
but the bytes received are UTF-8 encoded, and not percent-escaped:
'Location': ['/fa/news/1815565/\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb2\xd8\xa7\xd9\x85-\xd9\x83\xd9\x88\xd9\x87\xd9\x86\xd9\x88\xd8\xb1\xd8\xaf\xd8\xa7\xd9\x86-\xd8\xa7\xd9\x8a\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa7\xd9\x86\xd9\x8a-\xd8\xa8\xd9\x87-\xd9\x83\xd9\x8a\xd9\x84\xd9\x8a\xd9\x85\xd8\xa7\xd9\x86\xd8\xac\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd9\x88']
RedirectMiddleware decodes the header as "latin1" (this is new in Scrapy 1.1) and issues a request to http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%B9%C3%98%C2%B2%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%85-%C3%99%C2%83%C3%99%C2%88%C3%99%C2%87%C3%99%C2%86%C3%99%C2%88%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%98%C2%AF%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%86-%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%8A%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%86%C3%99%C2%8A-%C3%98%C2%A8%C3%99%C2%87-%C3%99%C2%83%C3%99%C2%8A%C3%99%C2%84%C3%99%C2%8A%C3%99%C2%85%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%86%C3%98%C2%AC%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%99%C2%88
which is not correct.
curl -i "http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/" and wget http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/ handle it just fine and correctly follow http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/1815565/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%83%D9%88%D9%87%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88
(curl fixed the issue not too long ago )
Thanks @stav for reporting!
