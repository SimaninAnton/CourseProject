I have wrote new delete function to delete existing model item if commit=False, but its not working, not showing any error. How can I achieve this? because I want to implement dynamic custom crawler as all scraping sites are dynamic, its updating contents at each specific time.
Help me please....
class SaveItem(DjangoItem):
django_model = ThinData
def save(self, commit=True):
    if not commit:
        self.delete(self.instance)       

def delete(self, item):
    """

    :param item:
    :return:
    """

    item.delete()
