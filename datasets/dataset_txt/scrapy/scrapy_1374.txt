I've made a classifier-based pipeline system for scrapy, and I was wondering if it could be featured as an extension. I'd appreciate any feedback:

My next step will be integrating it with the command system for scrapy. That seems like the most reasonable way to make it a viable extension. The packaging and unit-tests will come last.
