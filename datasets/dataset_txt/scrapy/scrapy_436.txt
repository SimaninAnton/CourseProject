I'm running Scrapy in Docker with an .env file where I define the SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE to decide which settings file I want to load. This throws ModuleNotFoundError, even if you point to the existing settings.py file and use the default value which will be myproject.settings.
I have replicated it with a brand new 1.5.0 project.
