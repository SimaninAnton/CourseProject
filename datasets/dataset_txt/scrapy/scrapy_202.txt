Hi everyone,
i am trying to get the title and the price from every div that has the class product-shop. The problem with my code now is that when I run it I am only having the information from the last div. This is my code:
class FiyoSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'fiyo'
    allowed_domains = ['fiyo.nl']
    start_urls = ['https://www.fiyo.nl/stofzuiger/stofzuigerborstel/kierenzuigmond/-siemens?device_brand=624']

    def parse(self, response):
        for vacuumCleaner in response.css('div.product-shop'):
            vacuumCleanerMounth = {
            'product name': vacuumCleaner.css('h2.product-name::text').extract_first(),
            'price': vacuumCleaner.css('span.price::text').extract_first(),
        }
        yield vacuumCleanerMounth
