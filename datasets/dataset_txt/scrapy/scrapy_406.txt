is it possible to make a new request method that can be added to scrapy schedule queue by scrapy engine?
situation: there's a page that contains all information, and a small part(is not at the bottom of page) of it are returned by an ajax whose url is available(seeable) in network developer tool
solution: so the simplest way is to use requests.get() of requests module to get that url, but how to achieve this with only scrapy that can also handle the same cookies of the site.
discuss: that add one more callback and pass all result/items to it by meta is possible, but is it also redundancy?
thanks
