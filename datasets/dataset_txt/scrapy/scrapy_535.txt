The version of IPython in tests/requirements.txt is not fixed to less then 6.0, so when testing is running under python 2.7, there will be an error on the requirement installing stage.
Please refer to Installation â€” IPython 6.2.0 documentation:
This documentation covers IPython versions 6.0 and higher. Beginning with version 6.0, IPython stopped supporting compatibility with Python versions lower than 3.3 including all versions of Python 2.7.
If you are looking for an IPython version compatible with Python 2.7, please use the IPython 5.x LTS release and refer to its documentation (LTS is the long term support release).
So it should be like this in tests/requirements.txt:
ipython<6.0
