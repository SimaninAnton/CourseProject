I'm trying to write a web view to track my crawler tasks and the logs as well
So, I write a simple Queue-based threaded log handler to save the log to a capped mongo collection.
Then I found the Spider and Request leaking.
As I debuged, I found that Spider and Request objects were passed into the logging Record many times.
So I sugguest you guys may add some docs or fix this in the future.
