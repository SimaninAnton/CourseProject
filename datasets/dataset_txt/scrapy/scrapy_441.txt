So i have a site that is made using ASP.NET (WebForms).
I was able to log in and even load a page by filtering a comboBox but when i try to paginate i receive:
179|error|500|The page is performing an async postback but the ScriptManager.SupportsPartialRendering property is set to false. Ensure that the property is set to true during an async postback.|
Is there any workaround to crawl this type of site? I see many params on requests i even try send them all but without success. Is scrapy capable of scrapy this? Or is better i will try with Selenium?
