Hi there, I recently upgraded to the latest scrapy and on some sites SSL enabled sites I get an exception when trying to make requests to it, while on previous scrapy versions I didn't have this issue.
The issue can be seen by making a request with scrapy shell:
scrapy shell "https://www.gohastings.com/"
The error I get is:
Retrying <GET https://www.gohastings.com/> (failed 1 times): <twisted.python.failure.Failure OpenSSL.SSL.Error: ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'sslv3 alert handshake failure'), ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_WRITE_BYTES', 'ssl handshake failure')>
