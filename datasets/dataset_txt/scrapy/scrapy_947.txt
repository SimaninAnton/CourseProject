Here I got an upset problem. When I use -o file option, I find the text in file just display as below:
{"title": "Docker \u5b9e\u6218\u7cfb\u5217 \u2014 \u8fd0\u884c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb9\u5668", "short_desc": "\u5f53\u4f60\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u6df1\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\n\n", "time": "07 Apr 2015"},
while I run file outputfile command in terminal, it shows blog.json: ASCII text, with very long lines. I can't understand, really confused. I just want the file display with my local language. And I know write utf-8 string to file will work correctly. So I added encode('utf-8') before assigning to Item['key'], but still no any change. Please help me, thx
