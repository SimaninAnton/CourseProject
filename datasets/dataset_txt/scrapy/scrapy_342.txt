Hello. I specify FEED_URI:FEED_URI = "file://feeds/%(name)s/%(time)s.json" and running the scrapy project with root user. But the feed file saved in "/%(name)s/%(time)s.json"
I found this and I try it in Python Shell.
scrapy/scrapy/extensions/feedexport.py
Line 82 in dfe6d3d
 self.path = file_uri_to_path(uri) 
In [1]: from w3lib.url import file_uri_to_path
In [2]: file_uri_to_path("file://test/file.txt")
Out[2]: '/file.txt'
By the way, my w3lib module is v1.18.0.
Although, I can write without 'file://' prefix like this to avoid that problem.
FEED_URI = "test/file.txt"
I'm so sorry. My English is pool.
