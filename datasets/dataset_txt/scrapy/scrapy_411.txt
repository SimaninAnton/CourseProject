In Scrapy Tutorial we read:
Remember to always enclose urls in quotes when running Scrapy shell from command-line, otherwise urls containing arguments (ie. & character) will not work.
later in Using Selectors we see:
scrapy shell https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/_static/selectors-sample1.html
As you see in above command, there is no sign of single/double quotes. so I think it might be a good idea to change this to:
scrapy shell 'https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/_static/selectors-sample1.html'
Thanks.
