Hi,
Feed storages should be able to access settings the new way.
For instance, S3FeedStorage uses both AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from the settings. Currently they're gotten from scrapy.conf but this is now deprecated: this cause the build of PR #1559 to fail.
What about adding settings to the constructor of storages?
