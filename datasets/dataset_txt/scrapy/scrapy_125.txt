I am encountering the following type of markup:
<p>Noting the presence of a footnote<sup>1</sup> is one common way for superscripts to be used.</p>
Test page:
https://html.com/tags/sup/
Test query:
response.css('div.render p::text')[0].extract()
Test results:
Noting the presence of a footnote
Test expected:
Noting the presence of a footnote is one common way for superscripts to be used.
Question:
How can I get the full text of the paragraph, ignoring the child tag?
