Hi,
when working with the itemLoader() to populate items from a created list in python. Here I have attached a working of the suspected bug.
This appears to be present when the loader.get_output_value method has been executed. Once that executes then, the populated list initially created would have one of the items missing. This appears to be a malfunction bug within the software presented. If we only have loader.load_item, the values are presented, however loder.get_output_value() fails to display the value/s in the data set as tested.
loader.get_output_value causes the items value to be missing from School:
