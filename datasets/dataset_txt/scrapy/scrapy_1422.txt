The following documentation is incorrect:
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#templates-dir
The following command line does not work:
scrapy startproject -s TEMPLATES_DIR=../lib/python2.7/sitepackages/mypackage/templates test_projectA
The same command line for "gendspider" does work. So the -s option appears to be working. It appears that the code in startproject.py does not check for overridden settings:
TEMPLATES_PATH = join(scrapy.path[0], 'templates', 'project')
as opposed to genspider.py which checks:
    _templates_base_dir = self.settings['TEMPLATES_DIR'] or \
        join(scrapy.__path__[0], 'templates')
    return join(_templates_base_dir, 'spiders')
At minimum, the documentation is incorrect and needs to be updated.
