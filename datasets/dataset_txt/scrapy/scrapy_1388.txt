This ticket is to track the work needed to remove the following deprecation warning introduced in Twisted 14.0.0 while still be compatible with older Twisted versions
lib/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py:160: DeprecationWarning: <scrapy.core.downloader.contextfactory.ScrapyClientContextFactory instance at 0x10a441b48> was passed as the HTTPS policy for an Agent, but it does not provide IPolicyForHTTPS.  Since Twisted 14.0, you must pass a provider of IPolicyForHTTPS.
  connectTimeout=timeout, bindAddress=bindaddress, pool=self._pool)
