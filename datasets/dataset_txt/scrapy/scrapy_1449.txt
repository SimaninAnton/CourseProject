I think about suggestion to improve scrapy Selector. I've seen this construction in many projects:
result = sel.xpath('//div/text()').extract()[0]
And what about if result: and else:, or try: and except:, which should be always there?
When we don't want ItemLoaders, the most common use of selector is retrieving only single element.
Maybe there should be method xpath1 or xpath_one or xpath_first that returns first matched element or None?
