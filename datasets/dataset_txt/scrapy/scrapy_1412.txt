I see a lot of StackOverflow questions and problems with CrawlSpider and overriden parse methods. (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23511230)
I'd like to see a new implementation, called CrawlSpider2 or CrawlingSpider or something, that uses another internal method with another name than parse,
so that user could define their own parse method.
Then, the question is if users will expect this parse method to be used by default for each downloaded page (is addition to being parsed for links with Rules),
or if the reference to parse should be explicit.
Thoughts?
