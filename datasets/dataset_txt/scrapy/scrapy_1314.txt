I have tried to get the file to export with a pipeline and with Feed Export. Both of these ways work when I run scrapy from the command line, but neither work when I run scrapy from a script.
After I run scrapy from the script the log says: "Stored csv feed (341 items) in: output.csv", but there is no output.csv to be found.
