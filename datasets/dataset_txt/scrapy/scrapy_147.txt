Hi everyone! I'm new here and want to know if scrapy can get multiples PDF from a site what resolve every request with PHP, the URL where I can get each file is:
http://extranet.domain.com/?p=downloads&did=1
The files are referenced whit numbers, in this case, the URL get the file with the id 1, I have 3800 files for downloads...
Hope someone knows how to solve my issue, thanks in advance.
And for the login request I use something like this..
from scrapy.http import FormRequest
request=FormRequest(url='http://extranet.domain.com/index.php',formdata={'username': 'theUserName','password':'thePassword',})
