I noticed that when a website spits out HTML with newlines in tag attributes scrapy's xpath selector doesn't match attributes anymore. I.e., something like
<div class="the_class

"> .. </div>
won't match xpath query "//div[@class='the_class']".
What I do now to work around this is:
selector = scrapy.Selector(text=response.body.replace('\n', ''))
This seems to work just fine, but maybe there is a better way to go about handling this?
