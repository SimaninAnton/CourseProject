The Scrapy Tutorial contain links to two pages,
Using Firebug for scraping and Using Firefox for scraping, that are outdated. Firebug isn't around any more, and the Firefox-page is full of references to outdated plugins. As the tutorial page is a starting point for Scrapy-beginners, an update is fairly important.
