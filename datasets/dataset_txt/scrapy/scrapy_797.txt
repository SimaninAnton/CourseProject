Almost every time I use the genspider command, I end up removing the www prefix from the value that this command generates for start_urls.
For example, this command:
$ scrapy genspider quotes quotes.toscrape.com
generates this spider:
class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes"
    allowed_domains = ["quotes.toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = (
        'http://www.quotes.toscrape.com/',
    )
    ...
IMHO, there's no need to add www to the start_urls, because it might be more annoying than helpful to people using genspider.
Thoughts on it?
