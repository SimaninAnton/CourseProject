While tracing the error that lead to #2555 I tried the workaround mentioned in the documentation without success.
This code lives incontextfactory.py but was not reachable as the import was failing on my system due to #2555.
This file is a large try/except block with many potential points of failure and it's likely to trip other users in the future.
That said, could this be refactored to provide a fallback for BrowserLikeContextFactory or otherwise reduce the scope of the try/except to avoid breaking the API?
