Hi, I am trying to use a method parse of Spider in a source.
The following is an ideal code, though it does not work.
url = 'http://www.foo.com'
responce = Response(url)
myitem = MySpider().parse(response)

return myitem
where MySpider implements some parse method to yield an Item instance.
The reason might be that the response in the above downloads nothing.
I think Request must be utilized to realize that, but I do not know how to do.
thanks.
