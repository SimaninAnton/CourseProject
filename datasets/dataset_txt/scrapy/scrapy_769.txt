This is a web page for a paper. There're some useful information to extract.
I want to extract title, author and abstract of this paper. So I wrote following code:
class PublicationSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "publications"
    start_urls = [
        'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15721472',
    ]

    def parse(self, response):
        for publication in response.css('div.rprt.abstract'):
            yield {
                'title': publication.css('h1::text').extract_first(),
                'author': publication.css('div.auths > a::text').extract(),
                'abstract': publication.css('div.abstr abstracttext::text').extract(),
                'doi': publication.css('div.aux a::text').extract_first(),
            }
Unfortunately, the code above could not return the right content. It seems that the abstracttext element cannot be recognized by Scrapy.
I tried to replace abstracttext with h4, and the script went well.
So how can I extract the content in abstracttext?
