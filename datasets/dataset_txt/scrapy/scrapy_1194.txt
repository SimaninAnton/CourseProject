I don't know if this qualifies as an issue, but I've noticed that Scrapy uses PIL rather than Pillow for its image manipulations. For example, for the ImagesPipeline. Development in PIL stopped in 2009, but Pillow, a fork of PIL, is now the new standard. This seems to be what I've gathered from the Intertubes and Wikipedia.
This isn't a huge deal, but I have been having some issues with PIL. They are fixable, but will get worse as time progresses.
