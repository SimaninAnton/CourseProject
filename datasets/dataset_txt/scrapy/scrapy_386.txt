Hi,
I am trying to use the -s flag according to this:
https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#command-line-options
But when I try it like this, the setting does not take effect: scrapy crawl spider.quotes.toscrape.com -s ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=False
It works if I manually edit settings.py and set ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED to False.
Why is this?
