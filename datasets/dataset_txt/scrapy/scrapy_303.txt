This concerns the meta attribute of requests and responses which allows to store additional data and configuration of plugins.
I noticed that all settings for all plugins are stored directly under the meta attribute. If one wants to store custom data, they first need to make sure not to overwrite/shadow existing keys using this list, but there are also other keys like splash (for the splash plugin) which are not listed.
So, a question/suggestion:
How about having another attribute (like spider_meta or self_meta or whatever) in requests/responses where the programmer can store custom values, thus avoiding collision with special keys?
An alternative could also be having a special key in meta (like user or spider or whatever) with the same purpose as above.
Or something entirely different: Move all current special keys and plugin-keys to a special key inside meta and the user just has to avoid this special key.
