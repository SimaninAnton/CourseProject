The policy here
scrapy/scrapy/pipelines/files.py
Line 83 in 4158839
 POLICY = 'public-read' 
is public-read - this means that even though the bucket is private, uploaded item will be public and accessible if you know the URL (at least that is what I get from direct tests, and I don't see where it could be overridden).
Probably this should be changed to private, and noted as a backwards incompatible security fix.
