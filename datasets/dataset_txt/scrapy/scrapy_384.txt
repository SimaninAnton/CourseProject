Or the only way today to rotate logs is to implement a handle on spiders?
I configured:
LOG_FILE = 'log.txt'
LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'
File name and log level, but unfortunately on doc i can't find anything related to rotate the logs, the only way i see that is possible is to add another handler on spiders, i want to know if is possible to change to change this on settings.py.
If is not possible i think this will be a great feature.
