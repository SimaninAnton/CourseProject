Documentation on Selectors says:
extract()
Serialize and return the matched nodes as a list of unicode strings. Percent encoded content is unquoted.
re(regex)
Apply the given regex and return a list of unicode strings with the matches.
regex can be either a compiled regular expression or a string which will be compiled to a regular expression using re.compile(regex)
but it doesn't say that .re() (and .re_first()) also perform HTML-entities decoding (except &lt; and &amp;)
See #1700
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34887730/how-to-extract-raw-html-from-a-scrapy-selector#comment57542664_34897754
parsel documentation is even less verbose.
