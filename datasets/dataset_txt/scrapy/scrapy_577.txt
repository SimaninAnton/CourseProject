Cloudflare is being used widely, which has has introduced its non-standard HTTP status codes. E.g.
Error 522: Connection timed out
Error 524: A timeout occurred
In practice, I've seen several occurrences of 522 and/or 524 status codes generated by Cloudflare. Usually a user may simply override setting RETRY_HTTP_CODES to include these values.
Here I suppose it might be good to include these two codes into scrapy.settings.default_settings.RETRY_HTTP_CODES.
