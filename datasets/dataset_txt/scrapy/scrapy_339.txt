I'd like to use the built-in email notification service for when a scraper exceeds a certain memory limit (MEMUSAGE_NOTIFY_MAIL setting), but it looks like it's not possible to specify the MailSender class to use to send the email. I don't want to use SMTP, I'd like to use a third-party mail sender (e.g. sendgrid).
Is there a way around this?
Thanks
