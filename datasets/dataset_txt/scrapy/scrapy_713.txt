I created some Scrapy crawler with Selenium to paginate the Google Reviews window. My code works well on my machine (Mac OS) but when I send to my Linux AWS instance the behavior of pagination is not the same. I guess that scrapy are missing the ajax requests of each pagination.
The pagination loads in a intermitted way, loading some pages but not all like in my machine. Do you guys have any idea what is happening?
