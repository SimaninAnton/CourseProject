I use scrapy startproject XXXX to init a project and build my spider.
And then everything is fine but blocked at a random step:
 2016-10-20 15:49:54 [scrapy] DEBUG: Crawled (200) <GET http://xxx.xxx.com/thread-2109141-1-27.html> (referer: http://xxx.xxx.com/forum-1286-27.html) ['partial']
Then it's totally blocked and no information output. Especially, when I tried to use double Ctrl+C to cancel the program, it doesn't work.
