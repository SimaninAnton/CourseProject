Follow the doc I write this code with shell :
scrapy shell http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/_static/selectors-sample1.html response.selector.xpath('//title/text()')
however:
is suggested:
[<Selector xpath='//title/text()' data=u'301 Moved Permanently'>]
but i can open :http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/_static/selectors-sample1.html
with my brower.
why ?
