If I use a local file in a request (e.g.
def start_requests(self):
    yield Request(path_to_file_uri(filename))

def parse(self, response):
    for url in json.loads(response.text):
        yield Request(url)
and then make a HTTP request in the callback, scrapy uses the file URL as the referer in the HTTP header.
I think file:// URL should be avoided from being used as the referer value (or generally any protocol other than http/s) because
it is not part of the normal hyperlink navigation
it exposes the local file structure to the remote site
