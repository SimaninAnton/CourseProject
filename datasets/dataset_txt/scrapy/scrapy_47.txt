Hi, everyone
 I want to download some firmware images. My snippet code in the get_media_request is as follows:
 url='http://luyou.dl.qihucdn.com/luyou/360P4C/360-P4C-V2.0.4.59512.bin'
 return scrapy.http.Request(url, meta={"vendor": item["vendor"]})

 However, error happens as follows:
 [(False, <twisted.python.failure.Failure builtins.TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing>)]

 Does some know how to deal with this?
 Thanks for any help.
