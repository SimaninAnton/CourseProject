Hello,
I run a ubuntu 14 LTS machine.
I get a conflict error with every scrapy command.
For instance:
When I try :
scrapy startproject store_name
I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/scrapy", line 5, in
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

pkg_resources.ContextualVersionConflict: (pyasn1 0.1.7 (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('pyasn1>=0.1.8'), set(['pyasn1-modules']))

Can someone help me ?
