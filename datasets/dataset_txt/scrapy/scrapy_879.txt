Hello,
Cuuld someone help with a website where the informations appears in the source page and the browser but get vanish as soon as I use "scrapy shell" or "scrapy crawl".
I am not banned for sure and the whole page appears correctly but not the div containing the data I need.
Here is picture of the below link (french website property auction) with a regular browser like mozilla :
http://www.licitor.com/ventes-judiciaires-immobilieres/tgi-fontainebleau/mercredi-15-juin-2016.html
I encircled the data I target, BUT let us do it with the view(response) from scrapy shell:
scrapy shell http://www.licitor.com/ventes-judiciaires-immobilieres/tgi-fontainebleau/mercredi-15-juin-2016.html
and here is the result: a whole div disappeared !!!
I have some error in my terminal:
To give you more information, I first tried on a scrapy project and I had to add DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS: {'s3': None} in my settings in order to get rid of an ERROR message...it did not work also, then by debugging I just tried with the shell and I noticed the response body was missing a part of the HTML.
I am running on ubuntu 14 and I have anaconda installed on it with scrapy 1.03.
Where do I miss the point please people ?
Thanks in advance for your help, I spent the whole afternoon on it !!
