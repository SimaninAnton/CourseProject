Currently EXPIRES in FilesPipeline and ImagesPipeline is defined as a class attribute. When running more than one spider with CrawlerProcess it is impossible to have different expires values for different spiders. Changing the EXPIRES attribute to an instance attribute solves the problem.
(I would do a pull request, but I have no idea how to properly update the tests.)
