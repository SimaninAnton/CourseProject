Python3.5 with latest Scrapy
I was trying to set the bindaddress with Request.meta , whatever (host, port) I chose, the program always complained about
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ld/.virtualenvs/scrapy/lib/python3.5/site-packages/twisted/internet/defer.py", line 1126, in _inlineCallbacks
    result = result.throwExceptionIntoGenerator(g)
  File "/Users/ld/.virtualenvs/scrapy/lib/python3.5/site-packages/twisted/python/failure.py", line 389, in throwExceptionIntoGenerator
    return g.throw(self.type, self.value, self.tb)
  File "/Users/ld/.virtualenvs/scrapy/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scrapy/core/downloader/middleware.py", line 43, in process_request
    defer.returnValue((yield download_func(request=request,spider=spider)))
twisted.internet.error.ConnectBindError: Couldn't bind: 48: Address already in use.
Is there any approach to that?
