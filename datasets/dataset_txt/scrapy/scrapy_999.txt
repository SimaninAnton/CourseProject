i have two spiders in one project,and only run one spider at a time but the varis shows in another spider when one spider runs .
IE.
class spider1(scrapy.spider):
name='spiderone'
print 'hello'
def parse:
class spider2(scrapy.spider):
name='spidertwo'
def parse:
when i run spidertwo,it will print 'hello'. but why? I only run one spider at a time
I'm really confused about it. how to deal with mutiple spiders ...the official dont show.
thanks a lot!!! from a scrapy beginner
