Hello,
My code aims to scrape a webpage (the one in start_urls) to retrieve a number in a "Show More" button.
This number will then be used as a parameter to request a URL that will return a JSON that contains data + a number. This last number will be used as a parameter to request the URL that will return a JSON that contains data + a number, etc.. The process goes on until the JSON return empty data + a number. When the data is empty, the scraper should stop.
Could you give me an example of a code that does a similar thing ?
