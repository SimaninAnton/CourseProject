This functionality was added here: #360
According to this https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/spiders/sitemap.py#L46 sitemap_alternate_links used for sitemap type sitemapindex, but not urlset, which is common use case for rel="alternate".
I don't think this is as expected, because that issue, docs and tests (which in fact tests xml parser, but not sitemap parser) in PR talks about urlset.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. Otherwise - I will prepare PR.
