I want to get the related question info in this stackoverflow link
Here is the relate question:

And here is my result by css selector
As you see in the pic I get the res like Firebug-like debugger for Google Chrome and Black Bar at top of website when using Google Chrome which can't be found in the web page.
But I can't find the Firebug-like or Black Bar
Then I search in the web source code and I can't find the Firebug, too
So, why I get the extra info here ?
