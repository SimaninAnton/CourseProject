Would anyone be interested in accepting a pull request which adds the following flag:
$ scrapy runspider spider.py --dc=Dev
Where --dc is the django-configurations (inspired by pytest-django) settings environment.
This would then do the necessary:
import configurations
configurations.setup()
And allow django-configurations users to do something in django like:
class Scrapy:
    # scrapy options ...

class Dev(Scrapy, Configuration):
    pass
