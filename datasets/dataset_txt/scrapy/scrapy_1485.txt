Currently not having https support with proxy are really hurting getting info that is based on ip address location. Some site use ip address geo location deliver content. Example Google or Kobobooks.com uses this method.
If you can give us some insight our staff is willing to write this section for you so you can add this back to the active development. We are using older version of scrapy 0.16.5. We would like to add the fix to the 0.16.X branch.
