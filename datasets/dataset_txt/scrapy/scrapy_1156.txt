Hi,
I tried the example spider with the url https://scholar.google.com and it didn't work.
I just had copied the spider file and removed unwanted things (for me). Mine version of spider file is as shown below:
import scrapy
class ScholarlySpider(scrapy.Spider):
name = "scholar"
allowed_domains = ["scholar.google.com"]
baseURL="https://scholar.google.com"
start_urls = [baseURL]
def parse(self, response):
        #nothing specific in this method right now
        print response
Mine items.py looks like this:
import scrapy
class ScholarlycrawlItem(scrapy.Item):
# define the fields for your item here like:
# name = scrapy.Field()
title = scrapy.Field()
link = scrapy.Field()
desc = scrapy.Field()
I have other files - pipelines.py and settings.py as the default one when creating the new scrapy project.
Sorry, I couldn't figure out how to format the code section in this bug tracking system, but I hope it is still clear as I dont have that much code section. The screenshot of the program execution is included in three images - error1 - error3.jpg because I couldnot grab the whole screen in a single image.
Thanks.
