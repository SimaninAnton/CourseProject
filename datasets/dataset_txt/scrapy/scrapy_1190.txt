I am trying to use scrapy to build a web crawler. I am using it on Mac OS yosemite and after installing scrapy I tried to run the program given on the scrapy website. But when I try to run it, terminal says scarpy: command not found. I really need help and quick help! Please. I think my scrapy is installed in a different path but I don't know how to change it so that it works.
