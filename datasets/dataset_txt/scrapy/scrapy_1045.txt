I would like to access settings.py from spider to do some customization like the following:
class BarSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "bar"
    allowed_domains = ["bar.com"]
    start_urls = (
        'http://www.bar.com/',
    )

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(BarSpider, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        print self.settings
        self.foo = settings.get('foo')

    def parse(self, response):
        pass
Is this possible?
