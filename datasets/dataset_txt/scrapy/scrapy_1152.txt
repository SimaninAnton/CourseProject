I understand this is a support question, but i've got no proper solutions after a lot of searching on sites like stackoverflow.com
My query is for the CrawlSpider
I understand rules is a static variable,
Can i change the rules in runtime say, like
@classmethod
def set_rules(cls,rules):
 cls.rules = rules
by
self.set_rules(rules)

Is this the acceptable practice for the `CrawlSpider` ? if not please suggest the appropriate method
My use case,
I'm using scrapy to crawl certain categories A,B,C....Z of a particular website. each category has 1000 links spread over 10 pages
and when scrapy hits a link in a some category which is "too old". I'd like the crawler to stop following the remainder of the 10 pages ONLY for that category alone and thus my requirement of dynamic rule changes.
Please point me out on the right direction.
Thanks!
