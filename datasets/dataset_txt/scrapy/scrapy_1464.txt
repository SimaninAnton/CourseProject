Hi all.
I just started using Scrapy and things were working fine until I tried moving from items to ItemLoaders.
I get an error that ItemLoader doesn´t have an 'add_xpath' attribute which makes no sense since it´s a method.
Here is my bPaste, hopefully you can look at it:

I´m parsing Facebook events from public fan pages (yes, my IP will probably get blocked one day).
