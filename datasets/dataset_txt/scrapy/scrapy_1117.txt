What about making a "boring" Scrapy 1.1 release, without much new features? User-facing improvements are small (deferreds in downloader middlewares, small scrapy shell improvements, AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY, docs improvements, loader.nested_xpath/nested_css, this kind of things), but internal changes are big: parsel, Python 3 porting progress. This makes backporting fixes to 1.0.x harder. By making 1.1 release weâ€™ll be able to forget about 1.0.x codebase and let all the internal changes settle down.
