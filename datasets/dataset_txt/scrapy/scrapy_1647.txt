In [10]: fetch('http://www.last.fm/music/AC%252FDC/+images')
In [11]: lx = SgmlLinkExtractor(restrict_xpaths=('//a[@class="nextlink"]'))

In [12]: lx.extract_links(response)
Out[12]: [<Link url='http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/+images?page=2' text=u'Next' >]
the found link gets mangled to have "AC%2FDC" but it should be "AC%252FDC"
