Problem
Both response.css and response.xpath ignored a lot of element after a special div element
How to re-trigger the problem
scrapy shell "https://redsea.com/en/apple-iphone-x-64gb-silver.html"
response.css(".page-title") or response.xpath("""/html/body/div[2]/div[2]""") both returns an empty array
What I found is wrong
I tried to extract the body element using response.css("body")
This is what it extracted
* This is the original html
* Where had the elements below the highlighted line gone?
