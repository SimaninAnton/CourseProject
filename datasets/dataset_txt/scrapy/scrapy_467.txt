I have tried to bundle my spider .py into .exe, but weeks pasted, I didn't make it. It pointed that some modules were missing. Even I used --hidden-import to put the missing modules into my bundled exe, it still didn't work. It's amazing that I can see the modules in the HTML document under build file. Pls help me ,Thks!
