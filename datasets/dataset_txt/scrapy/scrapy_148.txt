I just wanted to check what issues and their direction are really actual now, but I found tons of issues not closed.
They are already answered with "Please, ask your question through StackOverflow." from @Gallaecio or other contributors, but still not closed. This is a real-time loss if somebody just browsing to search interesting topic for self-checking/debugging/fixing. Maybe such persons just do not have additional issues moderation rights?
I expect the same thing in PRs.
