I am fairly new to scrapy and i am trying to crawl a page but the final item is not showing correctly all characters.
The site header:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
I try:
scrapy shell "https://olx.pt/anuncio/t4-excelente-preo-centro-almada-IDyKPJd.html#c49d3d94cf;promoted"
My response:
response.encoding: 'utf-8'
response._headers_encoding: 'utf-8'
What am i doing wrong?
