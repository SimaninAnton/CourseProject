Documentation states that boto must be installed if Amazon S3 is to be used. However, I was wondering what version(s) is/are supported.
Also, while setting up an S3 bucket with a private policy, the FilesPipeline fails since the key's contents are set with 'public-read' per (
scrapy/scrapy/contrib/pipeline/files.py
Line 76 in f6b1e9b
 POLICY = 'public-read' 
)
I'd like to propose a configuration which defaults to 'public-read'
scrapy version -v
