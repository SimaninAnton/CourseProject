Sorry for asking here but I could not find help anywhere else.
Usually to delete cache I just delete .scrapy folder in project directory.
But now I have a spider for which this doesn't work. Somehow I get the cached responses (I tested by turning off the internet so I am 100% sure). But I don't understand where they are coming from since my .scrapy folder is deleted.
P.S. I NEED to delete cache , I can't just deactivate it or set it to expire because of the way I build my spiders.
