I want to download pdf files from the pdf web links crawled by scrapy spiders, but when I use scrapy.Request (pdf_url) in filespipeline to crawl the pdf web, eventually it downloaded incomplete pdf files. all the pdf files was 1 KB Other than the first few files( which are complete). I had to use requests.get(pdf_url, stream=True) to download all the pdf files completely, but it is too slow. I want to know if scrapy filespipelines has similar method like this ?
