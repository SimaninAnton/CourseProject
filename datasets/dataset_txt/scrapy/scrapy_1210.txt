hello,all, I use scrapy 1.00rc1 from pip ,my pc is win7x64,python is 2.7.9(x64),
when I start my project
scrapy crawl imzx
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 859, in emit
    msg = self.format(record)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 732, in format
    return fmt.format(record)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 474, in format
    s = self._fmt % record.__dict__
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd6 in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)
Logged from file log.py, line 108
Then I find utils/log.py ,line 108 ,I commented-out the code as you can see
#logger.info("Scrapy %(version)s started (bot: %(bot)s)",
                #{'version': scrapy.__version__, 'bot': settings['BOT_NAME']})
And I restart my project,it's OK ,but something about logging error still:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 859, in emit
    msg = self.format(record)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 732, in format
    return fmt.format(record)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\logging\__init__.py", line 474, in format
    s = self._fmt % record.__dict__
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd6 in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)

It's to much in my screen,though too many logging Traceback , my code work fine ,I get all data I need, But I confused,my code work fine in scrapy 0.24 without any above logging Traceback,so I think it's maybe scrapy bug
