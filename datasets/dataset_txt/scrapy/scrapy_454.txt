I'm running multiple CrawlerRunner to crawl parallel sites, each CrawlerRunner has configured a different LOG_FILE.
When I run it, all the files just have logged the initialization of the Spider, until the line [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Spider opened
then all log into the same file.
I expect that each Spider logs into his configured file.
