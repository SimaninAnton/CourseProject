rustjson commented on Jul 29, 2016
Using the code in the doc:
 logging.basicConfig(
     filename='/home/jason/scrapyd/logs/scrapy.log',
     format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s',
     level=logging.ERROR
 )
But in the file scrapy.log, I can still see INFO DEBUG etc
ERROR: this is an error
INFO: please
ERROR: this is an error
DEBUG: Scraped from <200 http://www.xxxx.com>
I did not specify any log level in my settings.py, Which part could be wrong?
Thanks
