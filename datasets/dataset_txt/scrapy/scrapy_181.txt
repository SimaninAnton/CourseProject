I have a crawlspider which crawls given site upto certain dept and download the pdfs on that site. Everything works fine but along with link of pdf, i also need text inside anchor tag.
for eg:
<a href='../some/pdf/url/pdfname.pdf'>Project Report</a>
consider this anchor tag, in callback i get response object and along with this object i need text inside that tag for eg 'Project Report'.
Is there any way to get this information along with the response object. i have gone through https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html link but it not something that i am looking for.
