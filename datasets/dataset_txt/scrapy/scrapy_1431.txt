I think Request.meta['proxy'] should be documented. It is not documented now, see http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#request-meta-special-keys.
The only reference for scrapy+proxies is http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html?#module-scrapy.contrib.downloadermiddleware.httpproxy, and it is quite confusing.
