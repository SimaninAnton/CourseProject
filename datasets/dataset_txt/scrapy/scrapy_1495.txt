When creating a new project with the command 'startproject' and setting the name of the project to 'test', the project is created but it will cause future errors, such as the error below (reported in issue #54):
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/max/testscrapy/venv/bin/scrapy", line 8, in 
    execfile(__file__)
  File "/home/max/workspace/scrapy/bin/scrapy", line 4, in 
    execute()
  File "/home/max/workspace/scrapy/scrapy/cmdline.py", line 108, in execute
    settings = get_project_settings()
  File "/home/max/workspace/scrapy/scrapy/utils/project.py", line 57, in get_project_settings
    settings_module = __import__(settings_module_path, {}, {}, [''])
ImportError: No module named settings
In this case test is the name of a python library, and as such there is no settings module.
To avoid this problem we would like to add a validation, at least for 'test'. Is this something worth doing? We took some time before realizing, but on the other hand we can't cover all cases (i.e. project named 're'). What do you think?
