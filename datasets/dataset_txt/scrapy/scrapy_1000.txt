A follow-up to #1835. For the record, in my last project I had to also add the following extensions to ignored:
{
    '7z', '7zip', 'xz', 'gz', 'tar', 'bz2',   # archives
    'cdr',  # Corel Draw files
    'apk', # Android packages
}
cdr and apk look safe; I wonder if we can add .gz: Scrapy decompresses gz responses automatically, so if we add .gz to IGNORED_EXTENSIONS spider may stop following e.g. sitemap.xml.gz links.
On the other hand, for broad crawls most .gz files are archives, and we're filtering out .zip files already.
