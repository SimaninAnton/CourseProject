i am trying to call the spiders from one directory and save the output files to another in the windows cmd.
"scrapy crawl spidername -o c:/some/abs/path/results.csv -t csv" failed, but
"scrapy crawl spidername --output=open('c:/some/abs/path/results.csv' -t csv" succeeded.
why it works under open parentheses?
why it doesn't work for direct supply of abs path?
I tried but could not find where the related codes were written...
