Using version 0.16.4
Currently, if an invalid format is passed to the -t or --output-format options, the spider will proceed with its crawling operation, but no output will be saved or produced. This could be seen as frustrating on large scrape runs, in the event the user running it passed a mistyped format to the option and assumed their operation was saving output only to find later the scraped data has only been logged to stdout.
Should we make the output format option raise or fail+exit if an invalid or unknown format is passed?
