I wanted to extract links like '/questions/tagged/postgresql?page=3&sort=frequent&pagesize=50' from this page:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/postgresql?sort=frequent&pageSize=50
so I wrote the following LinkExtractor:
rules = [
Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=r'questions/tagged/postgresql?page=[0-9]&sort=frequent&pagesize=50'),
callback='parse_item', follow=True)
]
it didn't work.
after I changed it to:
rules = [
Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=r'questions/tagged/postgresql?page=[0-9]&sort=frequent.*?'),
callback='parse_item', follow=True)
]
miracle happened! it worked
so I thought there might be a bug in the LinkExtractor
