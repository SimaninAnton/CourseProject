Can someone tell me how to use scrapy-jsonrpc?I want to use the webservice to control scrapy.(https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-jsonrp) I modified the configuration according to the document, but I could not access http://localhost:6080/crawler....
a part of "setting.py":
JSONRPC_ENABLED = True
EXTENSIONS = {
'scrapy_jsonrpc.webservice.WebService': 500,
}
i use python3.5,and scrapy 1.3.2
if you know the problem,could you please answer me?Thank you very much...
