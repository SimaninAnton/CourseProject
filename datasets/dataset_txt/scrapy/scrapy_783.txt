Hello,
Thank you for all the work on this library.
We recently started to scrape some website using https using proxies (crawlera & proxymesh) but with proxymesh we always get the following error:
[('SSL routines', 'ssl3_read_bytes', 'tlsv1 alert internal error'), ('SSL routines', 'ssl3_write_bytes', 'ssl handshake failure')]
When using no proxy or crawlera, we are getting a correct response.
Using curl with proxymesh also seems to work...
Do you have any idea on what's happening ? I can provide the url website in private if need be.
scrapy version: 1.0.5
