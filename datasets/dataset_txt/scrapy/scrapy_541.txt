Consider the two log messages:
2017-09-17 10:52:27 [scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http11] WARNING: Expected response size (42276161) larger than download warn size (33554432).
2017-09-17 10:54:18 [scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http11] WARNING: Received more bytes than download warn size (33554432) in request <GET https://example.com>.
While the second one can be useful, the first one is not helpful at all because there is no info about which request it is about. The first message should indicate the request it refers to in the same way the second message does.
