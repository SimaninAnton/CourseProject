After compiling the scrapy documentation, make htmlview does not open the web browser.
>>> webbrowser.open('build/html/index.html') # does not work
>>> webbrowser.open('file:///path/to/the/index.html') # works
It works when I give the full path to the build/html/index.html file.
I have tested this using Python 2.7 and 3.6 on MacOS.
I believe this is an issue specific to MacOS. A minor change to the webbrowser.open() command in the Makefile should fix this bug. Shall I go ahead and fix this?
