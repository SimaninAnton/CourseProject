Following from scrapinghub/shub#293 (comment).
I'm trying to find the right place to show a warning for new users where they have not set the SPIDER_MODULES settings and cannot figure out how to run their spider (or get it registered on Scrapy Cloud).
For context, I wrote my spider from scratch without the startproject command.
