There is some issue with Twisted Package while installing Scrapy in Virtual Env, It stucks and raise Errors and raise error of Python.h not found, some suggested to update python3-dev. I did but the python3-dev is already updated, I am using ubuntu 18.04 and Pip3 for virtualenv. If i try to install globally It get installed perfectly, but i need it as depemdency for one of my Project
