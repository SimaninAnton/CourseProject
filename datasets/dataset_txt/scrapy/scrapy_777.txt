I tried lots of way to use the ERROR level, but still all information was wrote into log file
python 3.5 + scrapy 1.2
dmoz_spider.py

configure_logging(install_root_handler=False)
logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt', format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s', level=logging.ERROR)
settings.py

...................
LOG_LEVEL = "ERROR"
