Hello - this is a paste of how I got scrapy to successfully install on Fedora 23. It may be of use to other RHEL based distros as well. It's a bit tricky now that Python3 is the default.
(sorry about the cut and paste - it's late)
Pre-Reqs;
python-devel, python-rpm-macros, libffi-devel, redhat-rpm-config, openssl-devel, libxml2-devel, libxml-devel, python-lxml, python-libxml2, python-cffi, glib2-devel gnet2-devel libxslt-devel
and then finally
python2 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
(in a virtualenv)
I might've missed something, but hope this helps.
