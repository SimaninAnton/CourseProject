I have a special case where a script tag is placed outside the html tag :
<html>
....
</html>

<script>data</script>
both css and xpath selectors are not finding this script tag, the only way I found is using response.text , but that responds with a giant string and I can not make regex operations on it with selector re() function.
Is there a way to CSS or Xpath tags outside html tag?
I tried with
response.css('script')
But only consider script tags inside html tag
Thanks
