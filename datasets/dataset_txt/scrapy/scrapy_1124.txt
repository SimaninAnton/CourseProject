I used to access settings in my custom exporter using "from scrapy.conf import settings" which is now depreciated. 'from_settings' and 'from_crawler' don't work there what should i do?
class CustomCsvItemExporter(CsvItemExporter):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomCsvItemExporter, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    @classmethod
    def from_settings(cls, settings):
        print ('from_settings ran')
        return cls(settings)
