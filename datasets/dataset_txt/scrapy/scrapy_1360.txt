When no items are scraped, the corresponding file is created none the less, because it is created in by the storage.open call in FeedExporter.open_spider. This behavior ignores the the setting of FEED_STORE_EMPTY when using file export.
My proposal for this would be to add a cleanup method to the IFeedStorage interface. Then FeedExporter.close_spider can call that method before returning in case slot.itemcount is zero and self.store_empty is False. cleanup could also be called internally from the store methods of the IFeedStorage implementations.
