When using the following to extract all of the links from a response:
self.link_extractor = LinkExtractor()
...
links = self.link_extractor.extract_links(response)
On rare occasions, the following error is thrown:

I was able to find some information concerning the error from here.
My question is: What is the best way to handle this? Even if there is one bad link in the response, I'd want all of the other good links to be extracted.
