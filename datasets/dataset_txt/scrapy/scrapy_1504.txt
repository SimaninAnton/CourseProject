Example case (requires registration at example site, and even then would be hard to use as a use-case; modify to suit your needs): http://pastebin.com/GT8N893q
In the above example, the response.meta printout in after_submit callback does not match that within the inspect_response shell on the second iteration (the first is correct). It appears that inspect_response has a stale response the second time.
