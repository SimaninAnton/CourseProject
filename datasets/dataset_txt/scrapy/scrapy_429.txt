Hi everyone,
In order to start a scrapy project, I just set an ubuntu 16.04 VM. I installed ST3, anaconda 3, smartgit and chrome. That's all.
Since that, I tried to install scrapy by typing a simple:
conda install scrapy
and it gives me an error that I could not troubleshoot:
Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: failed
ERROR conda.core.link:_execute(481): An error occurred while installing package 'defaults::constantly-15.1.0-py36_0'.
PermissionError(13, 'Permission denied')
Attempting to roll back.
Rolling back transaction: done
PermissionError(13, 'Permission denied')
I did not find that much on this error. But the strangest part, is that I've done this installation a thousand time and I never experience this error.
Anyone here had this issue before ?
Regards,
Mic
