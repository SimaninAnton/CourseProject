Got this error while pip installing scrapy on windows:
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools": http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
I had to install the software and then it worked. The installation took about 20min so I would recommand to try another way.
