I am having issue with using Scrapy on windows. I use Anaconda on my Windows and installed scrapy following the instructions on documentation. When I tried to use scrapy on the cmd its failed as it could not import etree. I am not sure if the issue is with my paths or something else. Would appreciate any advice!
