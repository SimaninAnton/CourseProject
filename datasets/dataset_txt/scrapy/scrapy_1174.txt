I am using Scrapy 0.25 with Portia to scrape sites.
I enabled the ImagesPipeline in my project
After deploying to scrapyd, I have been able to save the images to my specified directory.
According to the documentation, the ImagesPipeline will update the 'item' with an attribute 'images' indicating the file name of the saved image. The issue is that when I inspect my items scraped from the scrapyd UI, there is no 'images' attribute.So there is no way to link the downloaded images to my items.
