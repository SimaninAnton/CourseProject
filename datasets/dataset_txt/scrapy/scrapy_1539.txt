It would be nice to also test for the values of the parsed item, not only their keys. For the moment, I use a yaml description for the item in a separate file. I call the contract using:
"""Comment for a spider callback
@contain_item filename.yaml
"""
In the contract, I check for the equivalence of the item in the output structure of the post_process method.
Is there a better approach for this ? if not I would promptly propose this code for a pull request.
