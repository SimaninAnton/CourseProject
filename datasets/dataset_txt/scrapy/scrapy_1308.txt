I wonder if it's possible to get the meta and response.url when errback is called. Here is my code:
class CdDvdSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    ...
    ...

    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        return Request(url, dont_filter=True, meta={'foo': 'foo'},
                       callback=self.parse, errback=self.error_handler)

    def error_handler(self, response):    # FIXME: argument is not response
        # print response.url
        # print response.meta['foo']
        pass
What I got is:
exceptions.AttributeError: Failure instance has no attribute 'meta'
I found a related post here on SO. It seems the latest Scrapy (0.24.4 as of this post) still doesn't provide relevant API. If this is true, is it possible to add this feature?
