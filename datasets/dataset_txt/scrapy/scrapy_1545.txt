There is an issue in XPathSelector, on selector.select('xpath') we have a list of selectors without response in them.
test:
selectors = hxs.select('//body')
assert(selectors[0].response, 'response is undefined')
fix: to add response=self.response as argument
#XPathSelector.select#line 52
        result = [self.__class__(_root=x, _expr=xpath, namespaces=self.namespaces, response=self.response)
                  for x in result]
