I've run pip install scrapy, but it doesn't seem that this has been installed properly.
Now when I ran scrapy on CLI, it ends up in the following message.
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: No module named configparser
I googled configparser, and apparently this used to be called ConfigParser.
Has anyone seen this issue?
Any advice will be appreciated.
