Hello all, i use scrapy to parse some prices, but search result is empty.
scrapy fetch https://market.yandex.ru/product/11168521/offers?how=aprice
and
wget https://market.yandex.ru/product/11168521/offers?how=aprice
have different results. Also. if I use browser with proxy, i see search results. If I use scrapy i see message "No result for this filter, try change it"
If HttpProxyMiddleware disable, itsl worked.
Scrapy 0.24.5
Thank you.
