The text currently says:
Now, let’s extract title, author and the tags from that quote using the quote object we just created:
>>> title = quote.css("span.text::text").get()
>>>title
'“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”'
Thetitle should be changed to text. In fact, if you scroll down slightly down in the for-loop, text is used instead of title.
