Hi, I installed scrapy using pip and virtualenv.
Everything seems to go fine, but as I try to do anything I get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: dlopen(/Users/seb/stuff/scrapy/scrapy/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lxml/etree.so, 2): Library not loaded: libxml2.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/seb/stuff/scrapy/scrapy/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lxml/etree.so
  Reason: Incompatible library version: etree.so requires version 12.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 10.0.0
I tried updating lxml using pip, but I already have the latest version. Why is this happening?
