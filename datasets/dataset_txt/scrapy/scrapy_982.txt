Regrets - Novice to python.
Is it possible to install Scrapy in a shared hosting environment with shell access.
'pip install scrapy' does run -- and results in various warnings and errors, including:
error: could not create '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scrapy': Permission denied
Can the package be placed in my user account area?
The complete log is attached.
Thanks, and sorry for the rather basic questions.
