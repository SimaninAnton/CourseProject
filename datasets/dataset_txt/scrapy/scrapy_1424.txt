I'm using scrapy to crawl a forum. I found that the mechanisms to transfer information to callback function of Request and Rule objects differ. Within my knowledge, in Rule i'm using cb_kwargs to transfer while in Request i'm using meta to pass information.
I'm not sure if I'm doing it the RIGHT way. If I'm, i think maybe this is not a good API design? In my opinion, using meta as well in Rule is a feasible design.
