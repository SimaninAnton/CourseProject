I am following the tutorial and when I ran the scrapy crawl lyric_spider, there is an error:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Filed'
This is my items.py code:
import scrapy
class LyricItem(scrapy.Item):
singer = scrapy.Field()
title = scrapy.Filed()
publish_date = scrapy.Filed()
word = scrapy.Filed()
And this is my lyric_spider:
import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractor import LinkExtractor
from scrapy.selector import HtmlXPathSelector
from lyric.items import LyricItem
class LyricSpider(scrapy.Spider):
name = "lyric_spider"
allowed_domains = ["littleoslo.com"]
start_urls = [
"http://www.littleoslo.com/lyc/home/category/style/rap/"
]
rules = (
Rule(LinkExtractor(allow = (r'page/\d+')), follow = True),
)
def parse(self, response):
    for href in response.css("div > div > a::attr('href')"):
        url = response.urljoin(href.extract())
        yield scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_dir_contents)

def parse_dir_contents(self, response):
    for sel in response.xpath('//div/h3/a'):
        item = LyricItem()
        link = sel.xpath('@href').extract()
        yield item
And my directory is exactly as the tutorial and the version of scrapy is 1.0.3
Anyone can help me? Thanks a lot!!!
