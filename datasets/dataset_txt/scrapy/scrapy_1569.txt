Due to this openssl bug:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/965371
Scrapy is failing to retrieve some pages via https such as this one:
https://www.onekingslane.com/login
More information about client/server version compatibility can be found here:
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/ssl.html#ssl.wrap_socket
Other pages that talk about this issue:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/116020/python-https-requests-urllib2-to-some-sites-fail-on-ubuntu-12-04-without-proxy
The error goes like this:
