Hello. I'm beginner of scrapy package.
Thank you for developing useful scrapy package. I am exciting in using it!!
[About my environment]
I have a trouble in use of scrapy shell from Jupyter Notebook and for each tools I updated to latest version(October, 30, 2018). I operate scrapy shell from Windows10. When I installed scrapy package, I used conda install command from Anaconda prompt.
[What I had tried to use scrapy shell]
①While reffering to official document of scrapy shell, I wrote command like [!scrapy shell "URL" ] on JupyterNotebook cell, but I can't get any response. The cell is running continuously with showing mark of [*] , until I interrupt JupyterNotebook Kernel.
③I had tried same code written in avobe on IPython kernel which I open with magic command "%qtconsole", but running cell respond nothing as well as former one.
③In part of arbitrary URL after scrapy shell command, I tried to change some URLs from lots of sites. But nothing is changed in returning.
④As an additional trial, I tried to use scrapy shell as root authority. As soon as Ithe shell window opened, it goes down and close.
[purpose of this question]
Would you mind if I ask you any solution in this problem? I can't specify causes .
What action should I take?
Thank you for your kind!!
