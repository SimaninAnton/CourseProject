I try to iterate with Selector, and i wan't index within the loop :
    def parseTopicTable(self, response):
        table = response.xpath('//*[@id="Main"]/div[2]')
        cells = table.xpath('//div[@class="cell item"]')
        for cell in cells:
            yield self.parseTopic(cell, `i need index here`)
and i try this, but i got an error
        for index, cell in cells:
            yield self.parseTopic(cell, index)  # got error here ~
so what's the right way to get index when loop the Selector
