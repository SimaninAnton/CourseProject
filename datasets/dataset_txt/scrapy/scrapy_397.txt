I can't seem to run the scrapy startproject tutorial command successfully (though I've been to in the past).
I'm using macOS High Sierra, 10.13.4 (recently updated)
I created a fresh conda environment with conda create --name scrape python=3.6 and source activate scrape
I ran conda install -c conda-forge scrapy then scrapy startproject tutorial
I get this error:
