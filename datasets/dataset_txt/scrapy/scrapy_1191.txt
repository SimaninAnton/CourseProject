I want to make a benchmark tools. But before I do this, I want to use existing scrapy tools or service to do it. I found "scrapy bench", and it is interesting. Can anybody kindly tell me how it works and where is the source? If I want to make such a benchmarking script where I should start and what are best practices?
Thank you very much!!!
