Hi,
I'm trying to scrap HTTPS site through HTTPS proxy that requires Basic authentication, the connection is established but scrapy does not issue client hello, and then does not get any data from the web site.
I can do the same using curl for example
curl -U user:password -x https://proxy:8443 -v https://icanhazip.com
it works without any problem.
Scrapy works with the HTTPS proxy if I change the target site from https to http
