I can't get an item to have a constructor that takes arguments because scrapy.item always ends up calling getattr(self, name) which throws. Are items not meant to have constructors, or am I not doing it right (good possibility, I am a Python novice).
My item class has the form shown below:
class TestItem(Item):
f1 = Field()
f2 = Field()
def init(self, f1=None, f2=None):
self['f1'] = f1
self['f2'] = f2
is there something that I'm leaving out, or is this not a proper way to subclass Item?
