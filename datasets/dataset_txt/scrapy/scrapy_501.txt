So, I spent the last 6 hours trying to get through a website only to find out the problem was with scrapy.
There is this website( I can't name the url) that checks for a special csrftoken in the header. Well to my surprise Scrapy has hard-coded the headers so it always titles them.
So my specific header is this one:
"X-csrftoken" but scrapy titles it to X-Csrftoken so the website cannot detect it.
We should allow in a setting to be able to remove this bug/feature because at the moment the only way I can edit it is by going into Scrapy source code.
