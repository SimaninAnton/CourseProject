Hi,
I'm installing Scrapy on Windows, and got this error when trying to do pip install Scrapy:
build\temp.win-amd64-2.7\Release_openssl.c(429) : fatal error C1083: Cannot
open include file: 'openssl/opensslv.h': No such file or directory
I've checked that I got the file mentioned in "C:\OpenSSL-Win64\include\openssl", and I've added to path C:\openssl-win64\include\ in user variable. But I'm still getting the error. Can someone please help out, thanks!
