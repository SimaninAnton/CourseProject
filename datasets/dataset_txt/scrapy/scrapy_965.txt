Hello :)
I've recently working with scrapy, and I got the idea to automatically dump the body of a gotten response to a file when an exception was raised inside a callback. A log would be printed saying where to find the file and the user can inspect what maybe has gone wrong :)
As I implemented an own little "crash dump system" (which works completely manually, meaning you need to catch and dump everything yourself), I thought of an integrated version.
Let me know what you think about this idea :)
Thanks in advance üëç
