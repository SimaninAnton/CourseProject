I often have problems with the SgmlLinkExtractor. Lets try:
scrapy shell "http://www.dachser.com/de/de/"
# in the shell
from scrapy.contrib.linkextractors.sgml import SgmlLinkExtractor
link_extractor = SgmlLinkExtractor()
link_extractor.extract_links(response)
This will raise an exception with SGMLParseError: expected name token at '<!/IoRangeRedDotMode'. Whats happening here?
