I think it's a bug, not a feature.
The proxy provider give the demo code:
r = requests.get("https://www.baidu.com/", headers=headers, proxies=proxy, verify=False, allow_redirects=False)
It works fine, It will fail when remove "verify=False".
Now I have to use the proxy in my scrapy project, There is no way to add "verify=False" in Scrapy unless I write my own HTTPDownloadHandler.
HEW, what a huge work......
