Hi All, After some tinkering on my Centos VPN I've finally got scrapy to be installed.
However when I tried to run scrapy on the console. It says
Scrapy 1.2.2 requires Python 2.7
However you can see below that I've installed Python 2,7 already and I've added alias to my
bashrc file to use Python 2,7 as the default version for python.
Why am I still getting that error ?
Please help... Thanks.
[root@vnode01 dhermanus]# python -V
Python 2.7.8
[root@vnode01 dhermanus]# scrapy
Scrapy 1.2.2 requires Python 2.7
