for example, the page source is bellow:
<img src="http://www1.pcbaby.com.cn/images/blank.gif" #src="http://img0.pcbaby.com.cn/pcbaby/1603/10/2799244_yunzaoqi0310-11.jpg" />
But I get next in scrapy:
<img src="http://www1.pcbaby.com.cn/images/blank.gif" />
I can't get the attribute "#src" in scrapy.
How can I get that? please help me! Hope your reply! thanks!
