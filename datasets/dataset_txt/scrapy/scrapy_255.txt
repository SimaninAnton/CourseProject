This is a minor enhancement when dealing with JSON requests.
Right now to do a json request we have to do something like this,
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
yield Request(url, method='POST', body=json.loads(data), headers=headers)
I'm proposing a new Request subclass that can save a few keystrokes.
yield JSONRequest(url, data=data)
Will be sending a PR for this.
