i got this problem when i use the ImagesPipeline to download some image（but some image can be download）...such as this image url:
http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/NmpHEAE5bXl1WYvWBOQBhDeB7Dar8JhIr4tHxouT9AbhZJO7wF1lv2bCUU1UX0YPtU70OUF7RRfnMQpubRJYpA/0?wx_fmt=png
this image can`t be download.
i think it is because the image type is JFIF，and the ImagesPipeline is not support .
i dont know how to Solve this problem, please help me
