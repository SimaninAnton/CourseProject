I recently upgraded scrapy to version 1.0.1. When I tried:
scrapy shell http://baywindows.com/my-very-gay-straight-cruise-123436
In [1]: from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor
In [2]: link_extractor = LinkExtractor()
In [3]: link_extractor.extract_links(response)
I got this exception: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 9-18: character maps to
Is it a bug or Scrapy version 1.0.1 has a few changes that I was not aware of?
thanks in advance,
