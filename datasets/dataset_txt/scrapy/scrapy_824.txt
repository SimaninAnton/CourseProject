dmoz.org changed layout a few months ago, breaking scrapy's tutorial badly.
We have lots of open issues or PRs from the community to fix it: #2023, #2032, #2090, #2130, #2180, not to mention the broken dirbot https://github.com/scrapy/dirbot/issues/19). Thanks to all of you for this.
The thing is dmoz.org may change layout again in the future and we need a more stable scraping-friendly website to serve scrapy tutorial's educational purpose.
Scrapinghub maintains a couple of fake-but-realistic websites that can be used for web scraping training, and scrapy know-how in particular: http://books.toscrape.com/ and http://quotes.toscrape.com/ (see http://sites.toscrape.com/)
/cc @eliasdorneles and @stummjr already working on this
