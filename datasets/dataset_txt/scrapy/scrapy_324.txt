I think https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/firebug.html should be replaced with something else, maybe an example of scraping http://toscrape.com using SelectorGadget. Or maybe a rewritten version of this tutorial can become a part of CrawlSpider docs.
Firebug no longer works (https://getfirebug.com/), example website no longer works, and this particular tutorial got very little love over the years - e.g. there is a junk text in the bottom of the page, this junk is introduced 9 years ago, and nobody took care of it.
