When I use scrapy crawl xxx -o xxx.json -t json to export a JSON file, it just give me some Unicode like u'H\ufffd\ufffdftsitz'. It defaults to export with Unicode, And I can't change it.
I found this method [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9181214/scrapy-text-encoding](scrape text encoding), But it does not work in Scrapy with Python3.
