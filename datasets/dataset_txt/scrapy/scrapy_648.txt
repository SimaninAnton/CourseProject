I installed scrapy. Tried to run the first sample program from here. I am getting the following error every time I run the command.
bozzmob$ scrapy runspider quotes-scraper.py -o quotes-output.json

I tried lot of solutions on stackoverflow(one, two, etc.,) and other github issues(one, two, etc.,). None of them helped. Please let me know how to fix this.
