I used scrapy to write a spider,now I want to run in server,so I use pyinstaller to package it.I add a setup.py
from scrapy import cmdline
cmdline.execute("scrapy crawl Spiderl".split())
use
pyinstaller -F setup.py
succeed get a exe,but run it get a error "Unknown command: crawl". the document said "crawl must run in the root of project directory". So how can I package a scrapy-program with out copy the source code of project to server
