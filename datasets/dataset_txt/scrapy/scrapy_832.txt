Scrapy parser is different from common browsers parser. For example :
<li>
    one
    <div>
</li>
<li>
    two
</li>
Scrapy will see this :
<li>
    one
    <div>
        <li>
            two
        </li>
    </div>
</li>
While common browsers would see this :
<li>
    one
    <div>
    </div>
</li>
<li>
    two
</li>
This issue can be avoided with BeautifulSoup, because BeautifulSoup can use different parsers : html.parser, lxml, html5lib... Is it possible to do the same with Scrapy ?
