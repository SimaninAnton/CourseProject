Would it make sense to add something to the top of scrapy.utils.request.request_fingerprint like:
if 'fingerprint' in request.meta:
    return request.meta['fingerprint']
This is useful, for example, if you consider two pages to be identical if they share the same productID query parameter:
def parse(self, response):
    ...
    request = Request(url)
    m = re.search(r'productID=([^&]+)', url)
    if m:
        request.meta['fingerprint'] = m.group(1)
I'm currently handling this with a custom duplicate filter, but it seems like it would be broadly useful.
