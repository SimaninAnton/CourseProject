Hey @lopuhin , I have some questions relating to the GSoC proposal.
Right now I am about to finish the proposal for the project Scrapy performance improvement and the draft is ready. I am just wondering if it is possible for one of the mentors (I noticed that you are one of the mentors for the project) to review it for me? The deadline is in one week so I just want to make sure everything is ready early :)
Please let me know when you have a chance :)
