For example, from this doc page: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exporters.html
clicking the "Edit on Github" link in the upper-right corner leads to a 404 error page (tested in Firefox and Safari):
https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/origin/1.6/docs/topics/exporters.rst
This has happened on every doc page I tried the link from.
I would like to help with some small grammatical edits in the docs (I'm new to Scrapy so I wouldn't make any technical edits). Would a pull request be appropriate for this type of doc edit?
Also, specifying which files certain code snippets belong in would be very helpful for beginners.
