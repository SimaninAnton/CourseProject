#1794 should make TLS/SSL connections work better in most cases, but there are 2 main points to be aware of:
default method is now OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv23_METHOD instead of OpenSSL.SSL.TLSv1_METHOD: it allows protocol negotiation (from TLS 1.2 -- when supported by platform -- to SSLv3) ;
custom DOWNLOADER_CLIENTCONTEXTFACTORY setting classes should accept an OpenSSL.SSL method param at init ; HTTP11 downloader handler instantiates the factory in backward compatible way though
