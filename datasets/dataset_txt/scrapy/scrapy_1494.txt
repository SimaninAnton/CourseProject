To me it seems pretty tedious to have to do log.msg(something, logging.DEBUG) all of the time.
It would be very useful if there would be specific logging methods for the different levels.
This could be as simple as:
debug = lambda message: msg(message, DEBUG)
info = lambda message: msg(message, INFO)
Or a bit more complex like this:
def debug(message, *args, **kwargs):
    assert not (args and kwargs), 'Cannot use named and unnamed parameters at the same time'
    return msg(message % args or kwargs, DEBUG)
If desired I can create a pull request.
