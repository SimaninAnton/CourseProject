I'm extracting js data using .re_first() and later converting it to python native data. The problem is extract/re method don't seem to provide a way to not unquote html, i.e.
original html:
{my_fields:['O&#\39;Connor Park'], } (ignore the slashes..)
re_first() output
{my_fields:['O'Connor Park'], }
turning this output into json won't work.
Is there an easy way around it?
EDIT:
re.search(r'exp', extract_first()) actually works, keeping the raw quoted html
extract_first() outputs {my_fields:['O&#\39;Connor Park'],
is it intentional that extract_first() and re_first() deal with quoting differently?
