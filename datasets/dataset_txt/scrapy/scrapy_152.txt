Hi,
I want to use scrapy.Items in my scraper, but I ran into some trouble.
I created two items with the same data inside each of them.
Is it possible to override __hash__ and __eq__ method for Link class below?
Code for reproduce issue:
import scrapy

class Link(scrapy.Item):
    link = scrapy.Field()
    domain = scrapy.Field()

all_links = set()

href = "https://google.com"
link1 = Link(link=href, domain=href)
link2 = Link(link=href, domain=href)
print(link1 == link2) # print True

all_links.add(link1)
all_links.add(link2)
print(len(all_links)) # should be 1, but 2 was printed out
