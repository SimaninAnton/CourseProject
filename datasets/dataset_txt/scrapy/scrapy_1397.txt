I think it is a good time to start providing wheels on pypi. There is not too many advantages for pure-python packages, but it is not hard to provide a wheel, and it makes installation faster (3.5s vs 2.6s in my local tests, with all data cached locally and without installing deps). Also, for some reason wheels are smaller than tar.gz archives - for Scrapy 0.23 it is 673K vs 744K, so downloading will also become a bit faster.
To create a wheel there is no need to add anything to setup.cfg now; pip install wheel; python setup.py bdist_wheel should do the right thing (until we gain Python 3 support).
