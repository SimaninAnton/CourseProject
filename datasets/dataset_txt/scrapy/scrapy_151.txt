When running scrapy crawl xxxspider, it starts ABCspider and throws an exception. I fixed the exception (caused by fake_useragent, it will be fine after uninstalling it)
Now there is a new "error". When running xxx spider, the printout is the custom_settings information of ABC spider.
From the picture, the sohuAppSpider is running, but the custom_settings information is the custom_settings of weixinxxxspider.
