I created a spider with command
scrapy genspider my_crawler1 http://smrafiq.com
and when i see file of spiders/my_crawler1 there was start_urls and allowed_domains value like this
allowed_domains = ['http://smrafiq.com']
start_urls = ['http://http://smrafiq.com/']
why http:// is again in start_urls? can't we solve this issue, if we can what files should I watch to repair it?
