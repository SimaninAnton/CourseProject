Currently, the log level of a root logger is always automatically re-set to NOTSET level in install_scrapy_root_handler function call if I add handlers to root logger:
scrapy/scrapy/utils/log.py
Line 110 in 108f8c4
 logging.root.setLevel(logging.NOTSET) 
Can anybody explain why this level reset is required?
This issue is relevant to issue #2352, #2149, I think.
