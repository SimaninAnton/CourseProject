Searching the documentation in Firefox 25 is busted (returns no results for any query), with the following error in the console:
Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #rtd-search-form input[name='q' @ https://media.readthedocs.org/javascript/jquery/jquery-2.0.3.min.js:4
Example URL that doesn't work: http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/search.html?q=duplication&check_keywords=yes&area=default
It seems to be working fine in Chromium 30.
