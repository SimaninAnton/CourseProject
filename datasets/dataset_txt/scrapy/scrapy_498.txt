I wanted to set CONCURRENT_REQUESTS to 1 but only for a spider to process request one by one with the correct order. But it's not worked when I defined it in spider.
Then, I found an option that seems to work in my case : max_concurrent_requests (present in scrapy code but not in documentation).
Is there Any reason why this option is not present in documentation ?
Is there another solution to limit concurrent requests of a spider or a domain ?
