Is there a reason why middlewares cannot return deferreds?
It could be used to fix the limitation mentioned in the documentation of RobotsTxtMiddleware.
The change is simple enough I could make a pull request for it myself, but I thought I would ask first if there is any reason for it to be the way it is.
