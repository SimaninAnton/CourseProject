I used the manual to install scrapy on ubuntu 16.04, but it failed because it was not able to install python-support (>= 0.90.0). Other sources report that this package is not part of the new ubuntu xenial anymore.
Quick&Dirty-Workaround:
wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/109052632/python-support_1.0.15_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i python-support_1.0.15_all.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install scrapy
