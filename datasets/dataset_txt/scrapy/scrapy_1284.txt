What do you think about getting rid of contrib and contrib_exp? Most of contrib is enabled by default anyways, it is not really contrib.
For example, we can do the following:
scrapy.contrib.downloadermiddleware -> scrapy.downloadermiddleware;
scrapy.contrib.exporter -> scrapy.exporter;
scrapy.contrib.linkextractors -> scrapy.linkextractors;
scrapy.contrib.loader -> scrapy.loader;
scrapy.contrib.pipeline -> scrapy.pipeline;
scrapy.contrib.spidermiddleware -> scrapy.spidermiddleware;
scrapy.contrib.spiders -> scrapy.spiders;
files from scrapy.contrib top-level folder -> scrapy.extensions;
contrib_exp - should we just remove it, or move contrib_exp.iterators to scrapy.util.iterators and contrib_exp.downloadermiddleware to scrapy.downloadermiddleware?
Also, @dangra or @pablohoffman said something about moving scrapy.core to scrapy.http or to a separate scrapy-core package.
I think we should also move scrapy.contrib.djangoitem to a separate repo, something like scrapy-django.
We are also inconsistent in singular-plural names (pipeline and loader, but spiders and linkextractors). I'm not sure if it worths fixing, but maybe it worths.
