Hello!
My team (created in a lecture called 'open source software' which I take in) is very interested in scrapy, but necessarily files need to be read (like README and LICENSE) are written only in English. We thought if these files are translated, more people like us can contribute to this project.
So I'm just wondering if we can join here:)
