I pip installed scrapy, but it does not appear to have installed the startup script.
As a result, when i use the command $ scrapy
i see the error: --bash: scrapy: command not found
I am able to import the file inside a python session with
import scrapy
so i am pretty sure it's installed. can someone please help?
