Hello Mentors and Developers,
I am Viral Mehta, a student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I went through the Scrapy GSoC 2018 ideas page and found all the projects to be very interesting.
I found the projects Scrapy performance improvement and Scrapy spider autorepair, particularly interesting.
I would love to contribute to Scrapy and participate in GSoC 2018.
You can know more about me on:

I do have some open source experience and I would like to try my hand by implementing a small new feature and/or resolving bugs.
I will be extremely thankful if someone could guide me regarding the same.
Thanking you.
Regards,
Viral Mehta.
