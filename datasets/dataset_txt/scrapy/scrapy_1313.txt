Thought that may be interesting for you. I couldn't get Scrapy working for existing project - Scrapy was unable to find my projects settings file. The only way that I got it working was hardcoding my app's settings in ~/.virtualenvs/myproject/bin/scrapy:
#!/home/eimantas/.virtualenvs/myproject/bin/python

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys
import os

from scrapy.cmdline import execute

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "myapp.settings")
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(execute())
