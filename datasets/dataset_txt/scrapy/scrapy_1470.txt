Hey,
I think that @redapple is right in #488 that base spider template needs more imports by default, but IMHO introducing more code generation is not a solution.
Scrapy top-level namespace is a bit funky now:
>>> import scrapy
>>> dir(scrapy)
['__builtins__',
 '__doc__',
 '__file__',
 '__name__',
 '__package__',
 '__path__',
 '__version__',
 '_txv',
 'boto',
 'django',
 'optional_features',
 'os',
 'pkgutil',
 'print_function',
 'sys',
 'twisted_version',
 'urlparse_monkeypatches',
 'version_info',
 'warnings',
 'xlib']
it contains boto and django, but doesn't contain shortcuts like Request, Selector and BaseSpider. What do you think about making them available as scrapy.Request etc and removing unintended exports?
Currently to write a basic spider user has to remember a lot of import locations. Scrapy docs omit imports sometimes (see #493), this also doesn't help.
My current list is BaseSpider (why isn't it named Spider, by the way?), Request, FormRequest and Selector, but I don't see much downsides in being more generous (Item? Field?).
