Hi,
Currently Travis CI is run only for master and release branches (see 79cb031). It doesn't run on pull requests/feature branches so contributors are not notified when their pull request is breaking tests.
Why was this change made? What do you think about restoring CI for pull requests by removing "branches" section from travis.yml?
