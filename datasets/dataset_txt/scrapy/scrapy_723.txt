I set proxy by this code:
class HttpProxyMiddleware(object):
    def process_request(self, request, spider):
        request.meta['proxy'] = 'https://127.0.0.1:8787'
It's error is:
scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http11.TunnelError: Could not open CONNECT tunnel with proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
Then I test the proxy by requests:
resp = requests.get('https://......', proxies={'https': 'https://127.0.0.1:8787'})
It' work!
So, what is it happen?
