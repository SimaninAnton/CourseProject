Are there plans to provide a package for Saucy?
The latest install docs currently suggest:-
"Donâ€™t use thepython-scrapy package provided by Ubuntu, they are typically too old and slow to catch up with latest Scrapy."
But the most recent version of Ubuntu isn't yet supported in the official Ubuntu Packages.
