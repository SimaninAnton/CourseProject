Okay, Basically
Scrapy has to follow 10 pages & each page has ---> 100 links
While scraping data from each link (Request Object created per link) I compute the TIMESTAMP and if it's "too old" (according to a program-pre-defined variable) It must STOP following links(pages). However it must NOT stop the program, but rather STOP following links and finish up scraping the "Request" objects it had previously created untill that point, and in doing so it will eventually come to a halt (it runs out links to scrape)
Is there anyway i can do this in scrapy?
I tried raising a CloseSpider Exception, but scrapy would not complete scraping all the "Request" objects it had already created.
