The scrapy parse command is a wonderful tool for debugging spiders. However in my project I pass information in the requests meta attribute that is expected by the parse commands. It would be nice if it was possible to include this data in the parse command, so that testing is possible without modifying the code to not expect the meta information (and risking to forget to change everything back afterwards).
proposed syntax would be something like:
scrapy parse --spider myspider -c parse -m meta1=a -m meta2=b
which would create dictionary entries { meta1:a, meta2:b } in the meta attribute of the Request.
