Just an idea.
I'm dealing with lots of json so very often I have to write code like this:
loader = SomeLoader()
data = json.loads(response.body)
data_i_need = data["some_key"]
loader.add_value("something", data_i_need.get("some_other_key"))
loader.add_value("another_value", data_i_need.get('something_else"))
this can go on for many lines and can be repetitve.
Would be really nice to have all this done in loader, so that I could write
loader = SomeLoader(json=response.body, json_key="some_key")
loader.add_json("something", "some_other_key")
don't know how difficult to implement this would be, just suggesting this as possible improvement.
