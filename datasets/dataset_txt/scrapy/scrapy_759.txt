I am using the following settings:
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.useragent.UserAgentMiddleware': None,
    'scrapy_fake_useragent.middleware.RandomUserAgentMiddleware': 400,
    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect.RedirectMiddleware': 500,
}

ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    'scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline': 1,
}
image_urls contains a link that further redirect to a different url
File (code: 302): Error downloading file from <GET 
http://xxx.xxx/1023019-01.jpg> referred in <None>
The Location header as well as status code are present.
