umrashrf commented on May 8, 2016
I made some tests and I found out this comment is not completely true.
Also, if some code uses issubclass(sub, OldName) or isinstance(sub(), OldName) checks they'll still return True if sub is a subclass of NewName instead of OldName.
I think this is always the case even without using create_deprecated_class. Can someone else check and confirm if that's right?
