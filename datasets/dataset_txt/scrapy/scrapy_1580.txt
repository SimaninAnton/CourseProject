I recently installed Python 2.7 on Mountain Lion. However, my Scrapy version is referencing another folder or something because when I cd into the directory and type scrapy list - the outputted list is an older version of my project.
Is there something I am missing?
Similarly when I do scrapy crawl <spider_name>.py I get spider not found i.e. scrapy crawl groupy.py however the spider does exist.
If its an older spider (from previous revisions) it loads the spider - however changes to the file in spiders/ is not seen.
I even updated BOT_VERSION to 1.5 in settings.py and when I run scrapy settings --get BOT_VERSION I returns 1.0
Running Scrapy 0.14
