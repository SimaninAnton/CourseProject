PEP8 is recommended in the docs but is not strictly enforced.
Some violations:
Multiple imports in one line
Two blank lines not maintained between class definitions.
Unused imports
Lines longer than 80 characters everywhere
I believe we should strictly enforce PEP8 and also edit our CI configurations to test for these violations.
I would love to submit a patch for this if the idea sounds good to everyone.
