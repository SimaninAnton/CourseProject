Hi,
I'm trying to learn how to work with splash for scrapy. I'm doing this tutorial: https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash.
I've created a scrapy project which I added to this post. When I run $ scrapy crawl spider1 everything works fine. However, when I add: DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = { 'scrapy_splash.SplashCookiesMiddleware': 723, 'scrapy_splash.SplashMiddleware': 725, 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcompression.HttpCompressionMiddleware': 810, }
I get a message saying: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scrapy_splash'. I've checked whether I have scrapy_splash installed with:
$ User-MacBook-Air:tScraper username$ pip3 show scrapy_splash
Name: scrapy-splash
Version: 0.7.1
Summary: JavaScript support for Scrapy using Splash

I've tried to import scrapy_splash into my spider script and into my settings script. If I do so, I get a message saying:
raise KeyError("Spider not found: {}".format(spider_name))
KeyError: 'Spider not found: spider1'
My script: tScraper.zip
Does anyone know how to fix this issue?
