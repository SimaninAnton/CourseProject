I have an issue where my crawler is ignoring images from a specific host. It does not download any images and it does not throw any error or log messages. If I replace the image path with any other image path from any other source, it works fine with exactly the same config and code.
I put up a public repo here that reproduce it:
https://github.com/marcuslind90/scrapy_error
As you can see in the example spider, I hardcode 2 paths like this:
loader.add_value('image_urls', ['https://media.fastighetsbyran.se/22943836.jpg', 'http://hemmon.com/house.jpg'])
The first image is ignored (and any other images on that host) while the second image is downloaded.
Anyone recognize this issue? Could it have something to do with headers? Also, I believe that the host is programmatically generating the images because you can append a ?Bredd=<pixels> parameter that will automatically resize the picture. Perhaps this could be part of it as well.
