The docs define class scrapy.contrib.spiders.CrawlSpider
But in Scrapy, updated to the latest version, I'm getting nothing. What's the deal?
>>> import scrapy
>>> scrapy.contrib.spiders
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'contrib'
