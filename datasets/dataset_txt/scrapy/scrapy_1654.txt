In link extractor reference we see passages like
"allow (str or list) â€“ a single regular expression (or list of regular expressions) that the (absolute) urls must match in order to be extracted. If not given (or empty), it will match all links."
There's two quite different methods for working with regexps: matching and searching. A quick look in sources reveals that in this case we deal with searching, not matching:
_matches = lambda url, regexs: any((r.search(url) for r in regexs))
So documentation is clearly misleading and should be corrected.
