We've recently added a badge to highlight progress on Python 3 port. I suggest to simplify the Python 3 support badge to just show a percentage. If you look at the other badges we have in the scrapy project you'll see that the value of them is usually simple (a number, percentage, or short text).
Showing just the percentage 54% would not only be more consistent with the rest but also easier to understand (what's "633 / 1153" anyway? which even comes before the percentage!)
