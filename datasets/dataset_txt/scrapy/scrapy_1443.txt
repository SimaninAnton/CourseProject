The Scrapy short description says:
Scrapy, a fast high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework.
I think would be better:
Scrapy, a fast high-level web crawling and screen scraping framework.
Because it highlights first its difference with simple screen scraping tools (i.e. Nokogiri. Mechanize, etc).
Screen scraping can be done even with curl and grep, but I don't think you could do web crawling with such simple tools.
Perhaps this can be an alternative:
Scrapy, a fast and scalable web crawling and screen scraping framework.
Also the term "web data mining" can be a good fit for Scrapy (along with Scrapely and similar tools) and help to shape its roadmap.
