Hi, I'm facing an AssertionError when set errback and not callback in Request, is that expected? :
...
    def start_requests(self):
        yield Request(
            self.start_url,
            # callback=self.parse,
            errback=self.parse_error,
            meta={
                'dont_redirect': True,
            },
        )
...
trigger this :
