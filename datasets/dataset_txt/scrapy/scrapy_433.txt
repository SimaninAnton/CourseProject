Hello, I opened this issue, regarding some discussions of unittests. I am planning to participate in Gsoc , and while I am going through the code base, I am getting hang of most of the code, except unittests. This is not something that there are issues with the codebase ; my main issue is that testing for asynchronous programming is something new for me, so I wanted some advices : 1. How to go about learning unittests ? 2. How do I apply my learning in writing code so that it is utilised with unittests ? 3. While applying Test Driven Development( which is quite new for me), how do I go about bringing new features, if I need to rewrite the previous tests and test-suites from scratch ?
EDIT : I am planning for the Asyncio Project of GSoC, so if specific comments for this project are there, you are most welcome.
