How do I make Scrapy to not follow links there go to a url with lower depth than the one I defined in start_urls
Example
if I wanna follow all links from the position example.com/shop/
Link Follow
example.com no
example.com/shop/32 yes
example.com/shop/32/54 yes
example.com/about no
example.com/someting/else no
