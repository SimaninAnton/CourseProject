Hi
I'm trying to install Scarpy in Mac OSX High Sierra after install python by Homebrew but always start with this warning:
"The directory '/Users/kintela/Library/Caches/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag."
I have checked that the current user "Kintela" is owner and has read/write permissons in that folders.
After the process i get this error
Installing collected packages: six, w3lib, cssselect, lxml, parsel, attrs, pyasn1, pyasn1-modules, service-identity, queuelib, PyDispatcher, constantly, incremental, hyperlink, Automat, Twisted, scrapy
Found existing installation: six 1.4.1
DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (six) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.
Uninstalling six-1.4.1:
