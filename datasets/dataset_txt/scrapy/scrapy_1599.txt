Many Web site's Open API limits the maximum number of requests in a certain interval from an IP address, Like 40 requests per minute.
How ever, the current arguments are CONCURRENT_REQUESTS,CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP, and DOWNLOAD_DELAY. Which depend on the duration of completing requests, so I feel difficult to adjust according to the threshold in API.
To achieve high performance and don't exceed the threshold of API, I suggests adding arguments like MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE.
Thanks!
