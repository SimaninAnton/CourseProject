I am unable to build one of my projects written few months ago using Scrapy. Its showing following dependency error -
Downloading/unpacking cryptography>=2.1.4 (from pyOpenSSL->Scrapy==1.4.0->-r /app/requirements.txt (line 3))
  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip_build_root/cryptography/setup.py) egg_info for package cryptography
    error in cryptography setup command: Invalid environment marker: platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    error in cryptography setup command: Invalid environment marker: platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'
As I have no control over Scrapy's dependencies and I have been using Scrapy 1.4.0, latest release, alongwith Python 3, I am not sure what are my options now?
Following is the command I use to install the dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Following is what my requirements.txt looks like
lxml==3.8.0
psycopg2==2.7.3.1
Scrapy==1.4.0
Twisted==17.5.0
validators==0.12.0
tweepy==3.5.0
I also posted the same on Stackoverflow.
