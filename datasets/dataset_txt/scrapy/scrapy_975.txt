I was trying to use the re_first() described on the Selector documentation page:
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html
I am testing it on scrapy shell, and I got the error:
from scrapy.selector import Selector
>>> body = '<html><body><span>good</span></body></html>'
>>> Selector(text=body).re_first
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Selector' object has no attribute 're_first'
What am I missing?
