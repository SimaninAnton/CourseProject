I think it would be great if scrapy embedded a tool like scrapy parseor scrapy shell to dump all the setting of the current project after bootstrap (at the time it reach the spider code).
I think this tool could be used in the future to post relevant information while opening an issue on github.
Is there anything like it already implemented in scrapy?
