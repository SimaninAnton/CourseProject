I think the architecture overview in Scrapy master docs doesn't explain correctly the difference between URLs and Requests. It says that spider returns URLs, and Engine converts them to Requests, but this is confusing - spider returns Requests. There are also "URLs" on the chart, but Scrapy passes Request instances almost everywhere, not URLs.
Old explanation (before #2165) didn't have this issue; as it is a regression I added '1.2' milestone.
