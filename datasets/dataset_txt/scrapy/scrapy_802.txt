I would like to try my spider but I am redefining the start-Requests method to route the request to my splash server to run the js
    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield SplashRequest(url, self.parse, args={'wait': 0.5})
but parse does not run this hook
I tried adding the callback option -c but it does not do
scrapy parse --pipelines -c start_requests -c parse -d 2 -v --spider aaa http://example.com
How can I run parse (to test a page) while being able to run the js hook?
