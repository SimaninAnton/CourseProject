I have a project using Scrapy 1.0.3. Everything was running fine, and after no considerable changes, spiders are taking at least 30 minutes to execute. Here are some logs from the prod environment:
0:  2015-11-13 12:00:50 INFO    Log opened.
1:  2015-11-13 12:00:50 INFO    [scrapy.log] Scrapy 1.0.3.post6+g2d688cd started
2:  2015-11-13 12:39:26 INFO    [scrapy.utils.log] Scrapy 1.0.3.post6+g2d688cd started (bot: fancy)
3:  2015-11-13 12:39:26 INFO    [scrapy.utils.log] Optional features available: ssl, http11, boto
As you can see from the logs, it took ~40 minutes to even start.
From my console if I run scrapy bench, scrapy list or scrapy check I get the same problem.
Does anyone have any ideas?
I've checked this on our dev and prod environment and having the same issue.
I thought it could be code related, but if it's effecting just basic scrapy commands, I am a bit confused as to what this could be.
Normal python scripts execute without issue.
Thanks
