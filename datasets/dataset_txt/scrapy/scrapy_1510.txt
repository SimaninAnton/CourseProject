I'm new to scrapy, and when I was trying to use the command 'scrapy shell' to crawl a url like this:
scrapy shell http://www.cuyoo.com/home/portal.php?mod=view_both&aid=18984
I found the second parameter after '&' lost in the information displayed, and it failed to get the page. It took me quite a while to realize that '&' is a special character for shell, then I tried:
scrapy shell 'http://www.cuyoo.com/home/portal.php?mod=view_both&aid=18984'
And it works! This is just a little problem, but would you please mention about it somewhere in the toutorial, I believe other rookies like me would appreciate it!
