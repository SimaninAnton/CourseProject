I am using scrapy script to load URL using "yield".
MyUrl = "www.example.com"
request = Request(MyUrl, callback=self.mydetail)
yield request
def jobdetail(self, response):
item['Description'] = response.xpath(".//table[@Class='list']//text()").extract()
return item
The URL seems to take minimum 5 seconds to load in browser because of javascript. So I want Scrapy to render javascript. I tried splash with scrapy but getting output as empty. I tried DOWNLOAD_DELAY also but not working.
