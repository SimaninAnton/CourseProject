For example:
Imagine on this page http://www.example.co.uk/?post=123 we have this markup:
<a href=" http://test.example.co.uk/">Test</a>
It's subtle but there's a preceding space before the URL in the href.
Instead of crawling to the URL http://test.example.co.uk/ it crawls this:
http://www.example.co.uk/?post=123%20http://test.example.co.uk/
Further more, if this page exists, then it may likely contain the same link, which means there's a link like this:
http://www.example.co.uk/?post=123%20http://test.example.co.uk/%20http://test.example.co.uk/
This causes an infinite loop.
Essentially, the solution is to trim URLs before crawling them.
