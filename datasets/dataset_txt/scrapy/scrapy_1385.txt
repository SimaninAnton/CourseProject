Scrapy 0.23.0-340-g4bb0989 - no active project

the version is inferred from git tags, the tag for 0.25.0 is missing and that's why it picks 0.23.0, but tagging 0.25.0 will trigger pypi deployment in travis-ci.
That's why I didn't fix yet, have to find a condition in .travis.yml to skip odd minor versions at https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/.travis.yml#L35. The condition is supposed to be a bash-like expression

travis docs are a bit scarse in this topic, and travis source code doesn't help too much to me. the only way to find a working condition is by trial and error but that takes time because you have to wait for travis on every commit
