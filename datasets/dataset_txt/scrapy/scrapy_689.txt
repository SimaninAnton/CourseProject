Hi, I'm using scrapy to scrape a few historical HTML documents, which are ordered by date. later, I want to order the documents by their publication date and them in pairs of 2 for similarity. Is there an elegant way to do this in scrapy?
Currently I'm trying to do this in my item pipeline (open the exported csv file in the close_spider method, parse it again, sort it, do the comparison). This feels rather clumsy. Is there a better way?
