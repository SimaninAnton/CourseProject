This has been troubling me for some time now but I would like this project to support a more powerful XML/HTML processing engine as an alternative to Lxml. The only contender for lxml in Python: Zorba. But why?
Zorba supports XQuery technology as well as JSONiq.
Zorba has Python bindings. I know they are not precisely the best bindings ever but at least they exist.
I think XPath 1.0 is very limited for more complex structures.
Lxml extensions are ok but not that much when compared to XQuery capabilities by default.
Zorba can be hosted as a service.
