before 12:54:43, one thread meets an exception, and the others threads run as usual, this is ok.
But the errors after 12:57:28 is due to the scrapy still running, and canot create a new instance.
I wait for one day, and the scrapy just don't stop. There must have some wrongs.
Lacking essential process after one thread happens an excepetion?
But why? and maybe this bug need to be fixed.
