I have noticed that few classes ( such as Spider class in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/spiders/__init__.py ) lacks docstring inside the source code. Instead, the documentation is provided in the project documentation files. If the developers and maintainers permit, I would like to work on moving the api docs to the source code. I will use autodoc to link it inside the project documentation files. I would love some suggestions on it, should I move ahead?
