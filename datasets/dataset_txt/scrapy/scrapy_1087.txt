It's implemented in scrapy/core/scheduler.py#L31 and not mentioned anywhere in docs. I think it's really useful, could be mentioned at least in http://scrapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html#request-serialization.
Since it isn't documented we could take the chance and rename it as well, this kind of settings are usually named <something>_DEBUG.
