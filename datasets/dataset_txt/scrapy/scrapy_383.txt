I'm not sure if it's right place to post this issue, but what I've just noticed is that CSVItemExporter creates multiple files for some reason with the same name (they have a number as the suffix though), so they look like
myspider_2018-04-26_15.09.06.231201 (26).csv
myspider_2018-04-26_15.09.06.231201 (27).csv
I use docker to run scrapy and it happens only on my Ubuntu machine. Again, I'm not sure if it's scrapy issue...
