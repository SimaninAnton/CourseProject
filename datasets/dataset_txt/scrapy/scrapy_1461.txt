SgmlLinkExtractor can choke on some pages that lxml is fine with.

Currently, LxmlParserLinkExtractor doesnt have some of SgmlLinkExtractor's useful constructor parameters like allow, deny etc.
Also, as lxml is already used for the Selector implementation, it would make sense to reuse the same lxml-parsed document (LxmlParserLinkExtractor doesnt use `LxmlDocument``at the moment)
