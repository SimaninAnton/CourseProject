Hello!
I have trying installing scrapy using both the 'pip' method and installing directly from the source code and keep running into the same error.
When I attempt to run any 'scrapy' based command in the terminal I receive the following output:
bash: /usr/bin/scrapy: No such file or directory
This error is very much correct as all python packages on my machine would be stored in the directory below and I have confirmed that the scrapy modules are indeed present.
/usr/local/bin/
Any ideas on how to resolve this issue? I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
