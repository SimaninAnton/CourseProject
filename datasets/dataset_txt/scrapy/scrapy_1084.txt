When <input> element has no type attribute browsers use default input type ('text'). See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#attr-input-type:
The missing value default is the Text state.
FormRequest doesn't submit such fields at all. Likely adding or not(@type) somewhere to xpaths can fix it.
