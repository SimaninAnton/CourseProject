Hi, there,
I tried to crawl some data using scrapy. And I did this.
for i in range(1,last+1): link = re.sub('pn=(\d+)', 'pn=%s' %i, respurl, re.S) log.msg(link, log.DEBUG) yield scrapy.Request(url=link, headers=self.headers, meta={'keyword': response.meta['keyword']}, dont_filter=True, callback=self.parse_single)
I changed the parameter 'pn' in the url to crawl the data. I can see all the urls are generated successfully from the 'log.Debug'. BUT!!! lots of urls are ignored (I don't know if 'ignored' is the right way to describe), these urls just don't enter the parse_single function. I have tried to search for the solution for such a long time, but in vain.
do you guys have any idea? thanks!
