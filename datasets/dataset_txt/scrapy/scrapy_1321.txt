Adding items to scrapy can be a tedious work when there are lot of fields to create and at the and all items are same type scrapy.Field(). I think creating a command like Ruby on Rails have, like:
rails generate model ad name:string description:text price:decimal seller_id:integer email:string img_url:string
In our case it can be like this:
scrapy genitem Product name url price brand image
This will help a lot to focus on writing spiders itself and simplify the task of defining data items.
What do you think?? @pablohoffman
