I installed the Scrapy-0.25.1 in crunch bang. The first time I start it. There is an error message said:
in crawler.py 22 line , global name: SignalMadnager (which should be SignalManager) undefined. After I changed the source code then everything goes fine. But I can not see the same error in the github code. So it is a typo ?
