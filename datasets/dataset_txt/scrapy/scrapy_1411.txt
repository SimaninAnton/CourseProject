I've been pondering this some time.
What is the recommended practice on middlewares here, explicitly including signals and binding to spider_opened|closed or defining open|close_spider which get called by the middleware manager on those signals?
SEP13 says:
remove methods: open_spider, close_spider. They should be replaced by using the spider_opened, spider_closed signals, but they weren't before because of a chicken-egg problem when open spiders (because of scheduler auto-open feature).
SEP18 mentions open|close_spider() as part of a/the new spider API, nothing on deprecation here.
