I am using scrapyd and a FEED_URI to save in a ftp endpoint.
Everything works fine but I would like the items to be also saved locally using the default scrapyd file location: eg. items='file:///var/lib/scrapyd/items/properties/distr/ca3636168d4711e69d740242ac110007.jl'
Right now, all the links to the items on the scrapyd webUI return a 404.
