I use splash plugin to render html in CrawlerSpider, but seems the rendered response type is SplashTextResponse, but in CrawlerSpider implementation _requests_to_follow only
allow HtmlResponse
this is the code link
So can I just remove the condition?
if not isinstance(response, HtmlResponse):
            return
