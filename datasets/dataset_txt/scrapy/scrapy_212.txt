I am trying to pass two argument to scrapy as per the docs, like this:
scrapy crawl myspider -a product_id=BEHEH -a last_update='01 January 1990' -s LOG_FILE=scrapy.log
but get the error:
crawl: error: running 'scrapy crawl' with more than one spider is no longer supported
Is this a known behavior or am I missing something?
I am on Mac OSX 10.14.2 with Scrapy 1.5.1
