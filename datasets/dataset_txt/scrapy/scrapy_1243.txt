http://scrapy.org/ lists the "latest version" as 0.24.
http://scrapy.org/doc/ lists the "latest version" as 0.24.
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/ contains documentation for version 0.24.
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/stable/ contains documentation for version 0.25.
I am confused by the inconsistency. What is the difference between "latest version" and "stable version" and why do they refer to different versions? This seems like a documentation bug.
