I am using Scrapy from almost 1 years I started it in a very naive way but now I started building up queues for different crawling request, but the biggest challenge I am facing is its lack of scalability it can only run on one machine with 32 threads. Does anyone implemented a solution which could scale Scrapy to multiple machines with one machine act as a master node.
I am writing a script to integrate MPI library on top of Scrapy so that it could be run on cluster. If you guys are aware with any of the existing solution please share.
Thanks
