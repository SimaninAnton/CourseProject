Hi there,
I've installed Python 2.7.2 on Windows 7 (32-bit), easyinstall and pip, as well as Scrapy using pip.
When I open a command prompt and issue "scrapy" I am met with this error:
'scrapy' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I've checked my %PATH% which has both the Python27 directory and the Python27 Scripts directory which is where the scrapy "binary" resides.
C:\>echo %PATH%
C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\system32\wbem;C:\Program Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Windows Live;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;C

This is not the first instance of this issue I've seen:

Yes the scrapy file exists:

Yes I'm using a normal windows command line prompt:

I can't put my finger on what I'm missing here...
