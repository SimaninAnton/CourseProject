I set the LOG_LEVEL setting to INFO in the Spider class via the custom_settings attribute but I still see the DEBUG messages in the console.
When I set it on the settings.py file or via the command line option --loglevel, it works.
I thought any settings could be set via the custom_settings attribute. Is that a bug? (Scrapy 1.0.3 and python 2.7.10)
class TestSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "Test"
    ...
    custom_settings = {
        'LOG_LEVEL': 'INFO',
    }
