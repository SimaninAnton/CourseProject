I have a suggestion for an improvement. I've added this to my local scrapy installation. Im sure it can be done more elegant, but its a start :)
The adress to bind to the socket needs to be passed to reactor.connectTCP in core.downloader.handlers.http._connect as bindAddress
See the diff file for an example.
Just add ip_bind = (ip-number, port-number) to your spider if you want to override the default.
see http://dev.scrapy.org/ticket/153 for more info
