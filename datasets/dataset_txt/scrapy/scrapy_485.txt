Scrapy still supports py3.3 (at least according to its trove classifiers in setup.py and the CI conf)
but some of its dependencies dropped support some time ago.
https://github.com/pyca/service_identity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#backward-incompatible-changes-1

This caused some problems when testing scrapy daemon with py3.3,
which was resolved by installing the enum-compat virtual package
There are several options here.
scrapy1.5 can drop support for python3.3,
scrapy1.4 can restrict the max versions for those dependencies
and enum-compat can become a requirement,
although there may be more things broken.
I didn't figure out why the python3.3 build for scrapy doesn't fail
but here is a failed scrapyd build https://travis-ci.org/scrapy/scrapyd/jobs/299029712
