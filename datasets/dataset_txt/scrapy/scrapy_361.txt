Where can users go for reasonably well informed, reasonably rapid, and reasonably polite answers to questions about scrapy? I know that's not what this place is for, but the irc channel is a ghost town, the subreddit isn't much better, and Stack Overflow is full of uninformed trolls. Maybe there is some other place that doesn't come up very high in google? Anything?
