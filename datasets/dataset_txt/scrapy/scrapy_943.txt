Hello, when I send requests at the same time(with dont_filter=True, because some will be error, and the 'DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT': 60),
some requests appear the info as following:
Retrying <GET http://www.xxx> (failed 1 times): User timeout caused connection failure: Getting http://www.xxx took longer than 1800 seconds..
It doesn't appear other error, and some log that
have crawled XX pages, and XX items.
I know the log from https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/core/downloader/webclient.py
but I don't know why.
Can someone help me?
