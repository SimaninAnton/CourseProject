The current benchmarking is done on a very simple page, where the bot just follows all the links. This does not actually give a correct scraping speed for a standard web page.
It could contain several images as well, along with some restrictions so that the benchmarking suite could give a realistic approximation of the scraping speed.
Any other ideas?
