As Pipeline implements pipeline.open_spider(spider) and pipeline.close_spider(spider), I assume that there is one pipeline instance shared by all spiders, instead of one pipeline instance owned by each spider, when runing multiple spiders in the same process.
Now I want to setup a db client in pipepline for all spiders shared instead of one client for each spider, but there is no open_pipeline and close_pipeline implemented.
So, is the statement above correct? Would you consider implementing open_pipeline and close_pipeline? Or open_crawler close_crawler?
