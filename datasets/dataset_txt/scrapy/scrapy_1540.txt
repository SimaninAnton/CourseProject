I see in the test-code that certain places use import unittest and few use from twisted.trial import unittest. If tests are implemented using Twisted unit-testing framework, then all occurrences of "import unittest" should be replaced with "from twisted.trial import unittest". Kindly comment if this change can be made without any other issues. I will send a pull request if it is the case.
