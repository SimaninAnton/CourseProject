Having a problem doing this command:
python scrapy startproject foo
get this error:
python: can't open file 'scrapy': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
I looked in C:\Python27\Scripts and could not find scrapy file. Pip is not installing it right I believe.
I uninstalled and installed and upgraded. Nothing works.
I am on Windows 7 64-bit using python 2.7
