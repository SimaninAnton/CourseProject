I have a downloader middleware that will do some stuff when its process_request is called. The problem is, for all my middlewares and some signals, that they are called twice. So for the exact same request (I even gave them a unique ID to be sure), process_request is called twice - why? The reason why I do not some code as an example is that it happens in all my projects, so I think it is more related to Scrapy in general. Note, it only happens with SplashRequest
