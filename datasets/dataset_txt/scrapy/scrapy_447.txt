I have been going through the GSOC projects of last summer, and I was interested in asyncio prototype. Now, there was one issue that came after I searched through the details of asyncio. Asyncio does not have any built in abstraction for error handling, unlike Twisted, so that means up a lot of work regarding error handling which is quite error prone when it is handled manually. So I wanted to discuss as to how would the developers would go about the error handling of asyncio ?
