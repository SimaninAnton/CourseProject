HI I have scrapy 0.25.1 in windows. I have moved my working spider from linux to windows but it is not working in windows. I am using scrapy crawl myspider -o output.csv. It is producing empty csv file. I am not a noob. I am returning Item object from my spider so it should work. Same code is working flawlessly under my kali linux. Please help
