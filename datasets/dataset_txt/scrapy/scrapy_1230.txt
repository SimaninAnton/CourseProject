This is my first time reporting an issue on Github so I apologise if I am breaking any etiquette. I just installed scrapy (on a Vagrant Ubuntu64 box ) and was running through the tutorial but kept getting errors at the section for starting up the scrapy shell. After a lot of searching I found someone who had a similar problem (but on one of their own spiders) and it boiled down to the fact that in the first section of the tutorial you have us create in the items.py a DmozItem, but in the settings.py there is this:
DEFAULT_ITEM_CLASS = 'tutorial.items.TutorialItem'
After I changed TutorialItem to DmozItem the shell worked perfectly.
I don't know if I missed a step somewhere in the tutorial or if this is unusual behaviour, but I just wanted to give you a heads up.
