Summary
Add a flag to settings (e.g. LOG_SCRAPED_ENABLED) to be able to disable the logging of each scraped Item on DEBUG level.
Motivation
Crawling with Scrapy on log level DEBUG provides a lot of useful context during development. The only problem is the "scraped" message (constructed in scrapy.logformatter.LogFormatter.scraped) - it obfuscates the log entirely in the command line and can be really frustrating in general. Adding a flag to disable this log message (with a default value so that the current behaviour doesn't change) would be really useful.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Right now you either put up with it or use INFO level instead which makes you lose a lot of useful log entries available in DEBUG level.
