The problem is that it uses ru_maxrss which is non-standard. It is in KB on Linux, but on OS X 10.9.1 it is in bytes:
$ python -c "import resource; print(resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss)"

I don't know if it is in bytes or in kilobytes in earlier OS X versions. It'll be great if somebody who have not updated to Mavericks check that. Anyone here? If not supporting OS X versions earlier than Maverick is fine, we could add a sys.platform check.
