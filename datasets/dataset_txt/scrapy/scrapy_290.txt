Hello,
I'm working on a middleware that loads some resources at spider_opened handler method. If those resources can't be loaded, I need the spider to be closed.
I tried to do that by raising the CloseSpider exception and also by calling crawler.engine.close_spider(...), but none of them works.
Is there a way to do that?
Thanks!
