It is not possible to export feeds to a FTP server configured in active mode with FTPFeedStorage.
Scrapy use ftplib and it uses passive mode by default, there is no way to configure this in Scrapy, there is a setting to enable active mode (or disable passive mode) in the downloader, so I think it would be a good idea to have this option in the feed exporter too.
