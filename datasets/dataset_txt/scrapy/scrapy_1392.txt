What do you think about moving the JSON-RPC interface (ie. scrapy.webservice) to a separate scrapy-jsonrpc package?. Aside from working fine and having tests, I don't think it's something that Scrapy users use much (or at all). It is a good proven mechanism for IPC and something that scrapyd could use (but never did), but I'm not sure Scrapy is the place to leave such large piece of functionality, which involves the following files:
scrapy/webservice.py - the JSON-RPC web service
docs/topics/webservice.rst - documentation
scrapy/utils/jsonrpc.py - JSON-RPC helpers
scrapy/tests/test_utils_jsonrpc.py - tests
extras/scrapy-ws.py - a JSON-RPC command line client
I think a separate package could bring more visibility to this (reasonable piece of) functionality and possibly ease its maintenance. If/when scrapyd decides to use JSON-RPC for communicating with scrapy processes, it can include the scrapy-jsonrpc package as dependency.
Thoughts?
