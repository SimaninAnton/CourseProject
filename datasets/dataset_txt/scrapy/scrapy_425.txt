Hi,
I am Ayush, B.Tech (CSE), 2nd Year, from Amity University, Noida. I came across the idea of automatically generating xpaths from scapshots and became interested at the same moment in the project and would love to work for the same.
I have worked with scrapy in the previous in a team, scraping news websites and storing information [1]. I have been developing in python since last one year and have done various projects in Django, Flask, StaticJinja, etc mostly on web development.
I am highly interested on working in this project and would like to discuss over the idea.
@cathalgarvey , I would really appreciate any guidance on pre-requisites for GSoC 2018 and this project as a part of GSoC.
