There is a website. When I visit it, in Chrome I can find that It will follow 7 redirects before I get the destination page. between these redirects, the website will write some Cookies and Headers items into the Browser.
If I use requests to get the beginning page, everything is fine and I can get the source html of the destination page. However, when I use Scrapy, the website will find my spider and block me.
I thought it must because there are some difference between requests and Scrapy in the behavior of redirect. Do you know what the difference really is?
