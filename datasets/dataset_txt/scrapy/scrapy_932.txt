The scrapy.linkextractors.IGNORED_EXTENSIONS were not being ignored for me in my scraper run. Digging into it, this seems to be because posixpath returns the extension with the '.', but the extensions are defined without the '.'
For example, this test fails:
def test_url_has_any_extension(self):
    self.assertTrue(url_has_any_extension('http://www.example.com/image.jpg', ['jpg']))
What is the correct solution here - to add stripping the '.' in url_has_any_extension or to add the '.' before all the extensions in IGNORED_EXTENSIONS? (Happy to do the work for a patch, but not sure which way to go).
