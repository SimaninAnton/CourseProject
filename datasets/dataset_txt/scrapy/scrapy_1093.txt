#1289 (and #1530) are backwards-incompatible. Should we revert this change and implement it in a backwards-compatible way, with a deprecation cycle?
revert default RETRY_HTTP_CODES to old value;
add RETRY_HTTP_CODES with new values to generated settings.py;
raise a warning if users donâ€™t have RETRY_HTTP_CODES in their settings.py files, saying the default value will change in future releases.
