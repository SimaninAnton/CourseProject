manhole module from twisted.conch has not been ported for python versions 3+.
Actual workaround I used:
Install manhole separately with pip
Modify scrapy.extensions.telnet.py and try to import manhole in case the import of twisted.conch.manhole has failed. If import manhole succeed, set variable TWISTED_CONCH_AVAILABLE = True
