I set up a scrapy project and run by scrapy crawl xxx.
I do not see any ouotput in cmd,however log msg does write to the log file.
I am using log like below:
from scrapy import log

def Pipe(...):
    ....
    log.msg("Actor_id: %s wrote to database" % (actor.id,),
                level=log.DEBUG, spider=spider)
How can I make it works?
