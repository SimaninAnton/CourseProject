Hi, i am new to scrapy recently. And i found that there used to be an option to set default selectors in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/selector/__init__.py
However, in the latest version, i notice that this feature have already been dropped.
I totally understand that sticking to lxml only will make the codebase much cleaner and simpler. However, i wonder that what if we want to use some customized selector, e.g. pyquery. (joehillen@6301adc)
I mean i wonder whether scrapy could provide a easy interface for us to overwrite the default configuration.
Thanks in advance.
