I installed scrapy by following the tutorial here, the installation was success but once I try to setup a project by it shows
nikhil@nikhil:~$ scrapy startproject tutorial
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/scrapy", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 2749, in <module>

    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: attrs
nikhil@nikhil:~$ pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: attrs
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:: command not found
Any idea about how to solve this error ..? I couldn't find any useful pointers via Google.
