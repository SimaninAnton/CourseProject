I am trying to create a scrapy project with a version of scrapy installed with
conda install -c conda-forge scrapy
I am getting the following error during install.
from cryptography.hazmat.bindings._openssl import ffi,lib
ImportError: DLL load failed: The operating system cannot run %1.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
