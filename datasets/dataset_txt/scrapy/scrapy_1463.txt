#515 got me thinking that some Scrapy settings are missed because they aren't documented in the main settings page (docs/topics/settings.rst).
One approach I came up for fixing this was to generate a list of all settings (regardless of which file/doc they're documented) but i couldn't find a way in sphinx to generate a list of all entities of a single role (in this case, "setting").
An alternative approach would to adopt the policy/convention of documenting all settings in the settings.rst file (perhaps splitting them in one section per component/middleware/etc) and refer to that file from the other docs (for example, donwloader middlewares in downloader-middleware.rst would refer to settings.rst for their settings documentation).
Currently, we used a mixed (probably half-transitioned) approach where we document settings separately (in the file where their component is documented) and also mix core & component settings in settings.rst. This proposal also aims to resolve that inconsistency.
Thoughts?
