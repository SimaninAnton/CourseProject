I am using scrapy to crawl some website, so I have to build a proxy pool, most of the proxies are working well but I can't directly connect to them due to the Chinese GFW, I tried to use shadowsocks(a socket5 proxy) as a middle proxy to make it work, but I failed, I tried Proxifier too, it doesn't work, I add python.exe to Proxifier and start crawling, it just show:
python.exe (9012) *64 - 127.0.0.1:10661 colsed, 0 kb sent, 0 kb received, duration< 1 second
it seems that the scrapy use twisted to handle the proxy and change the real target(proxy) to local address(127.0.0.1:10661)
I am currently using scrapy+shadowsocks+tor(we can't directly connect to tor in China), it works well, but it is too slow.
How to make it work? scrapy+shadowsocks+proxy pool. By the way, I am using scrapy on windows 7 x64 and windows 10 x64
