scrapy 1.0.3
invoked: scrapy runspider forumscrapers/spiders/myspider.py --pdb -o test.json

I briefly checked the scrapy code for 1.0.3, I don't see any obvious issue. The close spider is signaled and the success callback of store is called (since I get the log output, line 183 in feedexport.py).
My spider is not using any custom pipelines, it has default settings (autothrottle is enabled though).
This has occurred a few times - sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. (no other process has touched test.json).
Any ideas?
