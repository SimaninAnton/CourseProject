I need using subprocess.Popen to start spider , but can't work.
if I type the command in shell:
nohup scrapy crawl helloworld --logfile log.txt &
it workers well.
But if I using subprocess:
command = ["nohup", "scrapy", "crawl", "helloworld", "--logfile", "log.log", "&"] subprocess.Popen(command)
it can't work , and output:
scrapy crawl [options] <spider> crawl: error: running 'scrapy crawl' with more than one spider is no longer supported
so, how can I slove this problem?
