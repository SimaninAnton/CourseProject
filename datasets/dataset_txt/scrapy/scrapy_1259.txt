I run pip install scrapy, and it only gives me the error:
then I realized there is something wrong with cryptography, then I found this would be helpful: Install Cryptography using your own openssl on os x
Accroding to the link above, I run the following command:
$ brew install openssl
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" pip install cryptography
$ pip install scrapy
Then I successfully installed scrapy.
I don't know whether it's common for OS X users, if so, I think maybe the installation guide could be more specific for OS X.
System: OS X Yosemite 10.10.2
Python : 2.7.9
