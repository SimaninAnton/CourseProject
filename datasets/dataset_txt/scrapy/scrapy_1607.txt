I'm just trying to run through the tutorial and am thinking quite a few things have changed since it was last revised...
For example:
it talks about creating a directory "dmoz/spiders" which contrasts with the comment in "spiders/init.py" suggesting we run "scrapy genspider ...".
the code in the tutorial subclasses "BaseSpider", yet the genspider creates almost identical but subclasses "CrawlSpider"
doing as instructed (creating dmoz/spiders/dmoz_spider.py and running scrapy crawl...) fails with "Spider not found: dmoz" but following the comments in the codebase works ok.
That area seems to be the only bit that has changed significantly.
