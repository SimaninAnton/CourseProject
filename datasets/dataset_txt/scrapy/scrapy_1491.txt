When searching for scrapy docs, Google (the most used search engine) return links to latest version of the docs, for example: https://www.google.com/search?q=scrapy+downloader+middleware
Returns as first result: http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html
Even though the title says 0.19, this can be misleading and many users start trying the examples with the stable version of scrapy (for instance 0.18) and it's likely are going to get errors due backward incompatible changes.
So, I propose one of the following:
Change the "latest" version to a name that reflects that is the development version. (i.e., just "dev")
Each "latest" page should include a notice/warning pointing out that the current page is for the development version and add a link to the latest stable version which is most likely the version that most users are using at the time.
and 2.
Note: I have no idea if 2. it's possible.
