Hi,
I've tried searching for a similar problem but couldn't find a discussion in scrapy about it, so starting one.
build  │   func_args, _, _, _ = inspect.getargspec(func)
build  │ /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scrapy/utils/python.py:201: DeprecationWarning: inspect.getargspec() is deprecated, use inspect.signature() or inspect.getfullargspec()
We've stumbled into this log a LOT, actually getting spammed by it currently when we execute some twisted.trial.unittest tests where each unittest spins up a CrawlerRunner for our live tests that do exactly what unittests do but with live data fetching.
Could we leave the current behavior for py2 but port the getargspec to getfullargspec as is suggested in the warning? I see latter for py3 includes additional return values, but should be a quick port. Would you be ok with a patch? Thanks
