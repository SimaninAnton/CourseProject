The docs for BOT_NAME say that it is used for the User agent (https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std:setting-BOT_NAME) :
This will be used to construct the User-Agent by default, and also for logging.
However in reality it is not. Scrapy is using the user agent:
"Scrapy/1.7.3 (+https://scrapy.org)"
Setting USER_AGENT does change the user agent correctly.
