We have seen multiple cases for crawlers failing to connect to https urls due to differences in SSL_options+openssl+pyopenssl, i.e. #82 #194 #1429 #1434 #1227 #981 #26 #1101, our users usually found workarounds hacking ContextFactory but solutions remain hidden and lost in private project's code.
I think we have a chance to fix this problem for everyone by automating the process of retrying until finding a working set of options.
I think we can design a solution around making ContextFactory aware of request, configuring it trough values in request.meta (similar to #186), but also adding a downloadermiddleware that retries requests using different SSL options, of course it learns and set working options per hostname on following requests.
