Hi Guys,
I am unable to stop logs from getting printed on console for ubuntu,I haven't defined any logger myself, and for logging i am using python default logging. But I am unable to suppress the logs from getting printed on the console. I have tried every setting and every command line parameter.
Scrapy==1.0.3
Twisted==15.3.0
OS: ubuntu 12.04, OSX 10.10.2
Python: 2.7
command: scrapy crawl test -L ERROR <--- This prints everything
The logs come from scrapy.core.engine and scrapy.core.scrapper
