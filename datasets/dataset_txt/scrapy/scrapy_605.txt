Hello guys, I'm suffering from this error
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scrapy/cmdline.py", line 161, in <module>
    execute()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scrapy/cmdline.py", line 108, in execute

    __import__(name)
ImportError: No module named settings 
it's only happening while running in pycharm, however, it was working just fine the previous day.
I would be glad if you can help me figure out this issue and prevent it from happening in the feature.
