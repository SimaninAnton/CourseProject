When my spider enters the idle state I schedule a request through the engine like this:
self.crawler.engine.schedule( req , self)
and I expect that request to go through the spider middlewares. But after some investigation it looks like only requests returned by Spider.start_requests and those returned from callbacks are processed by these middlewares.
Maybe I'm scheduling the request in a bad way but if so it shouldn't be public (ie I'd prefix schedule with _).
