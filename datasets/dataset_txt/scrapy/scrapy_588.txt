Motivation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45113478/scrapy-request-returns-notimplementederror
Proposal: add an explicit message saying what's missing in the spider class definition.
Although obvious for experienced Scrapy users, NotImplementedError for missing parse can be obscure for newcomers.
Also, NotImplementedError is not mentioned in the docs for this situation.
