Can we use Feed exporter for S3 to store the items in an s3 compatible service, like Minio or Riak CS?
I tried setting the FEED_URI to my local instance of minio http://192.168.1.111:9000/minio/mybucket/%(name)s.json
but scrapy complains that "Unknown feed storage shceme: http".
If I try changing it to s3://192.168.1.111:9000/minio/mybucket/%(name)s.json it tries to pre-pend it to amazon:
CertificateError: hostname 192.168.1.111.s3.amazonaws.com doesn't match either of '*.s3.amazonaws.com', 's3.amazon.com'
Any thoughts? Am I doing something wrong?
