def start_requests(self):
request = scrapy.Request(url="http://www.xxxxx.com",callback=self.parse ,dont_filter = True,)
yield request
can anyone please help
if the website is not secured and calling from the start_requests it is raising the error like unsupported scheme b' '
but the same url is working in start_urls =["http://www.xxxxx.com"]
