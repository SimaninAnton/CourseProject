A few months ago JSONRequest was added to Scrapy (#3505) and released with the new Scrapy version 1.7.
However, I realized that the name is not in accordance with the rest of the classes: HtmlResponse, XmlResponse, XmlRpcRequest.
It should be named:
JsonRequest.
I know it isn't backward-compatible, but as it's a really recent addition and Scrapy 2.0 is on the way it could be fixed.
