the html is like below, i want to extract the link /example/category/pg{page}/, but the scrapy.link does not contains the node info(currentPage and totalPage), how can i extract the link with the node info
<div class="page-box">
     <div page-url="/example/category/pg{page}/"
             totalPage="35"
             currentPage="1"             
     </div>
</div>
