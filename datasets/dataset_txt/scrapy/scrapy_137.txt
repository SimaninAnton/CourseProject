dont_merge_cookies has some bugs: they say that
When some site returns cookies (in a response) those are stored in the cookies for that domain and will be sent again in future requests. That’s the typical behaviour of any regular web browser. However, if, for some reason, you want to avoid merging with existing cookies you can instruct Scrapy to do so by setting the dont_merge_cookies key to True in the Request.meta.
But this flag not only prevents merging of cookies, but also prevents sending of them:
scrapy/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/cookies.py
why? it may be a bug,I just want to do not merge cookies,but not to do not send cookies
