Hi there,
Is it possible to export items scraped every X items ?
I mean I have millions of items to scrape and am looking for a way to export my items every 100k items scraped for example.
One solution could be to have batch of urls and run one scraper per batch but maybe there is a more clever solution.
Thanks a lot
