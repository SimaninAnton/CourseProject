Upgraded from Scrapy 1.2.2 to 1.3.3. Twisted 17.x
Python 2.7.x on Windows.
Since upgrading, if I have a problem in my spider, i.e. my spider classes init gets a KeyError because I made a mistake, I see:
"Unhandled error in Deferred:"
And that's it. There is no traceback. I had to edit Crawler.py, Line 76, and use the traceback module to see the content of the error.
To the best of my knowledge I don't believe I'm doing anything to the logger (apart from a getLogger(name) call), and I can't see anything in the release notes that would indicate why this is.
As you can imagine, it makes debugging very difficult.
