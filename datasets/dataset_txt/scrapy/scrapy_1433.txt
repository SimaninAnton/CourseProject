I'm new to Scrapy and one thing that tripped me up was the crawler not following 401s and not giving any indication as to why. I've since figured it out after Googling and seeing a related StackOverflow question, but it strikes me as part of the scrapy crawl spider log output, there should be a log.DEBUG level output when a spider decides to ignore a request response.
