Hello,
When running
scrapy shell https://www.belezanaweb.com.br/homens/
And executing a simple:
In [2]: response.css('div.item').extract()
Out[2]: []
The item is over there:
It isn't load using JS because it is visible in curl:
curl https://www.belezanaweb.com.br/homens/ | less:
Could it be a parser bug? Running on Scrapy1.1.0rc4
Thank you
