The Exporters section of the docs give an example pipeline class called XmlExportPipeline. It defines methods spider_opened and spider_closed.
I found this confusing because the pipeline docs describe methods called open_spider and close_spider, with seemingly the same semantics. At first I thought the example methods were typo'd, until I saw that they were explicitly connected to the corresponding signals in from_crawler.
I'm guessing this is the "old way" of doing it, and the example predates the existence of the open_spider and close_spider methods?
Unless there's a reason to do it this way, I think the example would be clearer (and shorter) if it used the built-in names.
