When I try the sample code of scrapy tutorial in Creating a project, Extracting data,after type
scrapy shell 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/'
I got a exception like
twisted.internet.error.DNSLookupError: DNS lookup failed: address "'http:" not found: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed.
and my operating system is windows with python 2.7
