I installed the scrapy successfully. But when I try to start a project: scrapy startproject helloworld, an error occur:
Reason: Incompatible library version: etree.so requires version 12.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 10.0.0
I have download the newest version of lxml already. But the error still exits.
