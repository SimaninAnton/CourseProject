Imagine I am crawling foo.com. foo.com has several internal links to itself, and it has some external links like:
foo.com/hello
foo.com/contact
bar.com
holla.com
I would like scrapy to crawl all the internal links but also only one depth for external links such as I want scrapy to go to bar.com or holla.com but I dont want it to go any other link within bar.com so only depth of one.
is this possible? What would be the config for this case?
Thanks.
