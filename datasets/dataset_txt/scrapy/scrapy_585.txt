I have
d = {
        'LOG_LEVEL': logging.DEBUG,
        'LOG_FORMAT': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s',
        'LOG_FILE': 'scrapyroot'
}
configure_logging(d)
I am using CrawlerRunner(get_project_settings()) to run spiders. The setting above used to log the scrapy root logs to file 'scrapyroot'.
After updating to 1.4, scrapy root logs are printed to console; the file 'scrapyroot' is created but empty.
