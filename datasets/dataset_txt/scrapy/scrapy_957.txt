This is the part of codes:
def detail_page_request(self, response):
      ct_item = response.meta.get('ct_item')
      ct_item['title'] = title
      req = Request(url, headers=self.headers, meta={'ct_item':ct_item, })
      return req

def parse(self, response):
      ct_item = response.meta.get("ct_item")
     print ct_item
I get the ct_item not updated by the code:ct_item['title'] = title
