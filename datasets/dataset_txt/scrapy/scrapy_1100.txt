Is this one of those settings that cannot be overridden per Spider instance? Is it finalized before instantiation?
class SiteSpider(CrawlSpider):

    def __init__(self, **kw):
        settings.set('CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT', kw.get('maxpages', 100), priority='cmdline')
        super(SiteSpider, self).__init__(**kw)
...
What am I missing or is this even possible?
