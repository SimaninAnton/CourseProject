Long names in logs (e.g. [scrapy.core.scraper] instead of generic [scrapy]) are useful because
they show where the log message came from - this makes debugging easier;
it has an educational value - users become aware of various Scrapy components;
to filter out a specific kind of messages (or make them more verbose) user can set a custom log level just for one logger, but to do that user needs to know logger full name.
My preference is to even use full names by default, but an option to enable them is also fine.
Thoughts?
