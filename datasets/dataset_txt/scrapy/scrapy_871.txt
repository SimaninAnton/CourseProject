When I try to scrape multiple start_urls, data seems to be missed. Let's say:
start_urls = [http://abc.com/sub1] --> return 5K records
start_urls = [http://abc.com/sub2] --> return 3K records
but
start_urls = [http://abc.com/sub1, http://abc.com/sub2] --> return only 3.7K records
My custom start_requests:
def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield scrapy.Request(url=url, callback=self.parse, dont_filter=True)
I think it should return at least 8K records, but only 3.7K records. Anyone experience this problem? Please help!
Thanks!
