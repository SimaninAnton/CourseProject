Situation
I use FilesystemCacheStorage, and have saved about 1M requests, 30GB data (not sure, I'm still waiting for counting ...). And it can't proceed reporting no disk space, but I still have 10+GB on disk.
Interesting thing is that I can't even use auto completion now.

Comment
I don't know if it is a valid use case, I use filecache to save call to APIs to allow reprocessing the response as needed (to lower burden on service).
I think it's possible that fs has run out of inode. And the current implementation seem to create file for each request. Maybe can combine cache in save file.
Or maybe the solution is to use database?
