Building an URL relative to current URL is a very common task; currently users are required to do that themselves - import urlparse and then urlparse.urljoin(response.url, href).
What do you think about adding a shortcut for that - something like response.urljoin(href) or response.absolute_url(href)?
Another crazy idea is to support relative urls directly, by assuming they are relative to a response.url. I think it can be implemented as a spider middleware. I actually like this idea :)
