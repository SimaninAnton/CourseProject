fetch('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set?foo=bar', cookies={'foo1':'bar1'}, meta={'dont_merge_cookies': True}, headers={'Cookie':'foor2=bar2'})
request.cookies
request.headers['cookie']
is:
{'foo1': 'bar1'}
b'foor2=bar2'
but response.text:
{\n "cookies": {\n "foor2": "bar2"\n }\n}\n
shouldn't request.cookies been sent with the fetch request?
