After I failed to bundle .py document into .exe document by pyinstaller, I tried cxfreeze. Similar error happened. Someting went wrong when importing scrapy module, and AttributeError: module object has no attribute '_fix_up_module' appeared in the command window. Would someone tell me what happened. Can I make it? Thks!
