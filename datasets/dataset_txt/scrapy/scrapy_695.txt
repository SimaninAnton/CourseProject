A new section in the official documentation could be added where people could share their configuration files that they used to successfully scrape data from a specific website (by successful, I mean not getting banned and getting a good speed.)
This way, it would be easier for people without any prior knowledge of HTML, Python or Shell, could easily use scrapy to get data from those specific sites.
