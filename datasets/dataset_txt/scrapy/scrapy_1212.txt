This issue manifests when mixing old paths and new ones for extensions and middlewares (this can happen for example while using a newer version of Scrapy in a project that hasn't updated to the new paths yet). Since paths aren't normalized, the same component can be loaded twice.
Take these settings for example:
# scrapy/settings/default_settings.py
EXTENSIONS_BASE = {
    'scrapy.extensions.debug.StackTraceDump': 100,  # new path
} 
# myproject/settings.py
EXTENSIONS = {
    'scrapy.contrib.debug.StackTraceDump': 200,  # old path
}
While merging both dictionaries to build the list of components, the same StackTraceDump class is going to be loaded twice since it appears in two different keys.
