Scrapy shell doesn't follow redirects when you do fetch('http://google.com'), but it does if you do fetch(scrapy.Request('http://google.com'))`.
I realize this is a historic behavior, but I'd argue that it breaks the expectations for most users, since the most common expectation is that Scrapy would try to do what a browser would do, so I think we should change it.
In my opinion, not following the redirect should be the exceptional behavior, and so that's what should require the user to build a scrapy.Request object.
I think ideally, we would be able to pass a keyword argument to fetch, like:
fetch('http://google.com', redirect=False)
And only for that case it would set handle_httpstatus_all to True as explained by @redapple here: #2177 (comment)
