Rationale
Currently we use scrapy.http.Request as the default class for Request throughout scrapy. This makes scrapy quite bound to HTTP protocol requests. I understand that we have download handlers for "http", "ftp" and "s3", but this enforces request differentiation only by "URI" scheme.
We should have a common protocol general request: scrapy.Request and the request class should be configurable by settings.
DEFAULT_REQUEST_CLASS = 'scrapy.http.Request'
