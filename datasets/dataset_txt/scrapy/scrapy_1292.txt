My project includes a spider that yields several different types of Items. All my items inherit from a 'DefaultItem' that has fields such as 'url', 'time_crawled' and 'group_id'.
When defining FEED_FORMAT = 'csv', the feed exporter uses the fields of the first type of Item yielded as the csv's header/column names and then for subsequent yielded items (despite the Item's type) tries to export those items with the fields of the first yielded item.
Since all of the items have 'url', 'time_crawled', 'group_id' and fields that may share the same names, those columns in the CSV get exported but otherwise the column for particular field is empty.
