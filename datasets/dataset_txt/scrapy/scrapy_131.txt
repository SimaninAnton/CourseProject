The remove_namespaces method of the response selector is really really slow.
I'd suggest this should either be documented or optimised.
Examples:
I was post-processing a bunch of XML files - using this function they took about 2-3 days. Without this function they took less than 20 minutes!
One of the files I was processing turned out to be a 2.7million line XML file(!). This was running for multiple hrs before I killed it (12?). Without going through that function it was done in about 30 seconds!
I'm still using selectors and xpaths, but now using the *[local-name()= function instead.
