I am trying to scrape this webpage: "https://www.watsons.com.sg/" but scrapy always result in 400 error. Attached the scrapy run log as reference here:

I have tried inspect source in chrome and post and the content can be retrieved back by simple "get". So there should be no protection on the web site. Wonder what is wrong. Appreciate if anyone can offer suggestions or helps. Thanks.
