Processors for Item Loaders are really powerful and quite unavoidable. However the default set seems be rather barebones.
I have few suggestions from few processors I use quite often to fix that, them being:
StripChars(chars) - strips away leading/following chars.
TakeNth(position) - Like TakeFirst() but for nth element.
OnlyDigits() - gets rid of everything that is not a digit.
OnlyChars() - gets rid of digits and punctuation characters(string.punctuation).
Could any of those fit in scrapy processors?
