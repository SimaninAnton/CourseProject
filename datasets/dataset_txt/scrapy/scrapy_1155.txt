Dear Scrapy developer,
I crawl following url :
"http://www.baidu.com/link?url=trNkDflaMpWNZbbB5OphH_bi_8jMpse4zyjTFrexyYw-XAg9M9VmS6YfvsEdUaJEbHKMKfdoPu1LUVMynFNXv1DVVRE6vnmYvCZ1s4jkJae&wd=&eqid=ac8e85b700005ad90000000455c83eee"
and response with status code 200 and content as follow:
"<script>window.location.replace("http://testrepository.readthedocs.org/en/latest/MANUAL.html")</script>\n<noscript><META http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=\'http://testrepository.readthedocs.org/en/latest/MANUAL.html\'"></noscript>\n"
It's won't auto redirect to correct url, why? Maybe it's not scrapy bug, but is there any solution to solve this?
Very thanksful.
Best wishes.
