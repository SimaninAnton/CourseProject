I've read lots of threads on stackoverflow regarding this issue. For most people it was problem with spaces in path.
That is not the case with me. The weird thing is that after fresh installation of Anaconda/Miniconda and successful instalation of scrapy, I can always do ONE action (whether it's running the spider, creating new project, etc.)
Next try, even though I haven't changed anything results in:
failed to create process.
