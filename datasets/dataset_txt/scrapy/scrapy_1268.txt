I'm working through the Scrapy Tutorial for the first time. The Extracting Data section uses sel extensively for selection (e.g. sel.xpath('//ul/li'))
When I run these commands in the scrapy shell, I get warning:
<string>:1: ScrapyDeprecationWarning: "sel" shortcut is deprecated. Use "response.xpath()", "response.css()" or "response.selector" instead
If sel is deprecated, then the tutorial shouldn't use it.
