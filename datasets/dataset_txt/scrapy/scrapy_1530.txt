Sometime I need to set a gmail address as the sender of the email in the scrapy's mail sender, but gmail require to use port 465 and set the SSL to true. But when I check the code of scrapy/mail.py, I found it use ESMTPSenderFactory to send the email, but it set the requireTransportSecurity fixed to False. Can the future version of scrapy change this into a property that can be changed via the settings?
