Following instructions at Running tests, I just ran
tox
in the top level scrapy directory. Unfortunately, it failed with
Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
ERROR: could not install deps [-rrequirements.txt, boto, Pillow, leveldb, service_identity, -rtests/requirements.txt]
even though both requirements.txt and tests/requirements.txt are accessible.
I worked around this by manually installing the dependencies with pip install ... and removing the deps entry from the tox.ini file. After that, tox ran successfully with only 3 tests failing
============== 3 failed, 1134 passed, 3 skipped in 204.43 seconds ==============
This is the current master branch at commit 2a7dc31.
