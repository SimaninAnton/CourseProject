It's related to #2905. When I'm using scrapy, I got the error "Failure instance: Traceback: <class 'ValueError'>: filedescriptor out of range in select()". So I want to try replacing the twisted reactor to pollreactor. However, I cannot use my project settings. When I run
`from twisted.internet import pollreactor
pollreactor.install()
from twisted.internet import reactor
from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerRunner
from scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings
runner = CrawlerRunner(get_project_settings())`
it raises the error "ReactorAlreadyInstalledError("reactor already installed")
twisted.internet.error.ReactorAlreadyInstalledError: reactor already installed".
Can you help me to fix this?
My environment is MacOS Catalina 10.15.1, Python 3.8.0, twisted 19.7.0, and scrapy 1.8.0.
