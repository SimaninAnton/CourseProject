The documentation for pipeline specifies that process_item must either return a dict with data, Item object or raise a DropItem exception. Is there a reason why we aren't allowed to return an iterable of dictionaries with data (or Item objects)? It seems impossible to write a pipeline that modifies the input item and returns multiple items under the current framework.
Thank you!
