There's something wrong. I can't get it.
If I set proxy to 223.202.2.85:8888 scrapy always returns 502 bad gateway.
This proxy works OK even with command line wget. This proxy works OK with Firefox.
I've even checked whether it's twisted problem. No. Simple twisted http client with this proxy also works OK.
I'm having so much problems with proper proxy support, spent a lot of time for this.
Any clue?
Btw, How to enabled full request/response debug, so I can see what is client sending and getting back on the wire (http level)?
