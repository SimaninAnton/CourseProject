The documentation states that additional parameters on the BaseItemExporter class, are left to the JSONEncoder (for example).
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exporters.html#jsonitemexporter
... and the leftover arguments to the JSONEncoder constructor, so you can use any JSONEncoder constructor argument to customize this exporter.
Despite the following is looking implemented at scrapy/contrib/exporter/__init__.py:96 it is not working because the BaseItemExporter constructor halts before telling that there's wrong argument set.
Seems like a bug on the line 32 of that file. Can someone from the core team confirm it?
