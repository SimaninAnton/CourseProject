Currently the Response.follow method supports Selector objects whose root tag are <a>. It'll be nice to support also link tags.

Sample code:
# Now
for href in response.css('link[rel=next]::attr(href)').extract():
    yield response.follow(href)

# When the proposed feature is available
for link_sel in response.css('link[rel=next]'):
    yield response.follow(link_sel)
