I tried yielding scrapy.Item from Pipeline class and also tried yielding dict directly
but in console, it shows like \uc18c\uac1c\uae30\uc0ac
Whereas I print with logging.info(item) it shows Chinese/Japanese correctly
i tried
LOG_ENCODING = 'utf-8'
in settings.py but does not work
So, my question is, how do I make Scrapy print Chinese/Japanese characters in console when yielding items?
