I want to extract the data 商品编号：1057746 from page whose url is “http://item.jd.com/1057746.html”.
on the scrapy shell, the following xpath is used: response.xpath('//*[@id="summary-market"]/div[2]/span'), but the blank list is returned. I have checked the xpath with XPath Helper on chrome, I can get the data with this tool. so is there a bug of scrapy?
