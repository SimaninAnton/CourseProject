I have this piece of code that only executes the first yield's callback and not the next one. I have tried reordering them and it gives the same result:
Only the first yield callback gets executed.
        for j in range(totalOrderPages):  # the code gets in the loop
            productURI = feedUrl % (productId, j + 1)
            print "Got in the loop" # this gets printed 
            yield response.follow(productURI, self.parse_orders, meta={'pid': productId, 'categories': categories})
        yield response.follow(first_page, self.parse_product, meta={'pid': productId, 'categories': categories})
Is there anything in Python or scrapy that prevents 2 consecutive yields?
Second question:
I'm trying to debug this using pdb.set_trace() but when I try to execute yield from the debugging console, it give the yield outside function error.
Does anyone know how can we debug yields?
Thank you.
