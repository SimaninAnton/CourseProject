In the documentation how to contribute to scrapy (Section testing), it is said that running tests can be done by bin/runtests.sh, however this file does not exist anymore.
Neither can I find a file bin/trial as mentioned on the trial website (to which there is also a link).
Also the tests are not in scrapy.tests (scrapy/tests) anymore, but in tests.
This section should be updated to newest testing environment.
