Hello, dear Scrapy maintainers!
Today I've got crazy recursive POST redirects from FormRequest's with server responded 301.
Changing
redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
to
redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url, method='GET')
in RedirectMiddleware solve's this problem.
Is this a bug?
