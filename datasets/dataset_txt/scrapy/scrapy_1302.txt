There is no doc for scrapy.extension.ExtensionManager.
Besides, by looking at the code, ExtensionManager is derived from MiddlewareManager and both of them do not provide any useful information, except self.middlewares.
I think the ExtensionManager should provide access to all the initiated extension objects by name, perhaps.
