The documentation says that if we add a max_retry_times in meta of a request it would take higher precedence over the RETRY_TIMES settings.
Well I don't think it's true, because max_retry_times doesn't work at all, but I noticed that retry_times works perfectly as the documentation says max_retry_times would work.
I believe that the right thing to do is keep the retry_times and fix the documentation, once it looks like the standard for any settings in Scrapy projects.
I can open a pull request to fix this, but I'm not sure if it's a bug or the documentation is wrong.
