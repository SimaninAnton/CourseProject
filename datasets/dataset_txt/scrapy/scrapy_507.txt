dont_merge_cookies docs are incomplete: they say that
When some site returns cookies (in a response) those are stored in the cookies for that domain and will be sent again in future requests. That’s the typical behaviour of any regular web browser. However, if, for some reason, you want to avoid merging with existing cookies you can instruct Scrapy to do so by setting the dont_merge_cookies key to True in the Request.meta.
But this flag not only prevents merging of cookies, but also prevents sending of them:
scrapy/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/cookies.py
Line 27 in b8870ee
 def process_request(self, request, spider): 
Maybe a separate issue, but it'd be nice to have separate flags for sending and merging of cookies.
