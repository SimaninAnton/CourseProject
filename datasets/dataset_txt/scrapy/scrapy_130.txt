Hi,
I'm trying to use the ImagesPipeline but I'm not happy with its naming convention.
I've extended ImagesPipeline in order to provide an alternate file_path method, but now I'm stucked.
The request originate from an Item object and I want to save images using a meta-information that is available in the method that build this Item.
I was not able to find a way to propagate this information to the request that arrives in the file_path method. Is there a way to do this?
Thanks!
