I'm getting segmentation fault when trying out xpath queries through scrapy shell.
When using scrapy shell with any URL I always get a segmentation fault on the second experiment, for example with a "simple" page as google homepage:
scrapy shell "https://www.google.pt"
'>>> sel.xpath("//")
'>>> sel.xpath("//")

I'm using Mac OSX Mavericks with the stock lxml lib. Here is OSX's information about the crash: http://pastebin.com/2eSMRBZF
