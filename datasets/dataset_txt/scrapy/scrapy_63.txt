it looks very lousy print out on terminal when I use return/yield,
however,since it a lot of other infor are helpful I won't change the log level to suppress it.
Is there anyway to disable the print of return/yield of parse without change log level?
class ZixunhtmlSpider(scrapy.Spider):
name = 'zixunHtml'
allowed_domains = ['xxxx.com']
start_urls = []
with open("G:/crawl_data/choice/obsolete/zixun_temp.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as fgg:

    for line in fgg:
          start_urls.append(line)

def parse(self, response):
    ex = ''
    if response.status != 200:
        ex = 'None 200 happens!'
    else:
        ex = response.text

    output[response.url] = ex
    print("===========================================\n")
    #return output
    yield output
