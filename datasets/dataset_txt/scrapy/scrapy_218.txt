Hi,
I would like to yield more requests at the end of a CrawlSpider that uses Rules.
I noticed I was not able to feed more requests by doing this in the spider_closed method:
self.crawler.engine.crawl(r, self)
I noticed that this technic work in spider_idle method but I would like to wait to be sure that the crawl is finished before feeding more requests.
I set the setting CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT = 30
What would be the code to wait 20 seconds idle before triggering the process of feeding more requests?
Is there a better way?
