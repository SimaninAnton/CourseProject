Hi,
I have been playing around with the images pipeline to store images on AWS S3. The full images and thumbnails get stored in S3, but only full images get the ACL applied, the thumbnails don't.
I was expecting the thumbnails to set the same ACL as defined by IMAGES_STORE_S3_ACL . I could not find any specific scrapy setting for this.
Appreciate your feedback.
Cheers
