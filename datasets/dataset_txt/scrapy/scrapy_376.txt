To track the performance, I usually use telnet localhost 6023 to Scrapy and then execute prefs() to check some info.
However, when my scrapy project running in a container of Docker, I can not execute telnet localhost 6023:
telnet localhost 6023
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
P.S.: I have already attach into the container, this command is executed in the container.
