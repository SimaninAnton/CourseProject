What do you think about making 0.22 branch default in RTFD?
This will make "latest" point to latest stable release instead of pointing to master. The option can be found in "advanced settings" menu - it is not the same as making 0.22 doc version default. It may be necessary to enable docs for "master" branch manually after doing that.
We can also enable canonical URLs (main settings menu) - I think this should solve issues with Google searches pointing users to versions of Scrapy that are too old or too modern.
