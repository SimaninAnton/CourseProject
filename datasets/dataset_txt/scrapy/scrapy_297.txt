I have the following scenarios:
1, user login (multiple users may log in at the same time, what should I do? )
2, get data after login success (get)
3, according to the data obtained in the second step, post request data again (support post request?)
The third step has two results, success or failure, if the successful completion of this user's task, otherwise continue to take the third step.
The above is my usage scenario. Can I make an API instead of shutting down the crawler every time I crawl data, and how to support multiple users crawling data at the same time?
