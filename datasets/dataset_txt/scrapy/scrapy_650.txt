This is a feature request.
I understand that it's possible to add custom extensions. I am proposing extension(s) to scrape semantic data. To my knowledge, many web pages use one of these:
Microdata
Opengraph
Parsley
Typically, the data extracted will include date of publishing, author name, site name, title, main image URL, etc. Since not all pages on the web are using semantic markup, the extension can also have a feature to create custom mapping: css/xpath selection mapped to relevant data.
What do you think? Any pointers on how to create a custom extension? Thx.
