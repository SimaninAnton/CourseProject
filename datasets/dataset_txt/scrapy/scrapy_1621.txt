We want to had pluggable link extractor backends, maybe having a LINKEXTRACTOR_CLASS setting.
Some backends that come to mind: pure-regex, scrapely, libxml2, lxml, sgml
The sgml backend is not working very well, as there have been some issues reported about it:

The scrapely backend workrks quite well and it's pure-python, so it's a good choice. But we'd have to add the dependency to scrapely.
