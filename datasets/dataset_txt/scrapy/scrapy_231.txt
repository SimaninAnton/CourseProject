Hello,
i do a request to a site with https and also use a proxy. When defining a middleware and using process_response in it response.headers does only have the headers from the website. Is there any way to get the headers from the CONNECT request the proxy tunnel establish? The proxy we are using is adding some informations as headers in this response, we want to use it in the middleware.
I found out that in TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint.processProxyResponse the parameter rcvd_bytes has all infos i need.
Thanks in advance for your help.
