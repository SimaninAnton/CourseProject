If we will make a request like this
def parse(self, response):
    # some code
    yield scrapy.Request(url, callback=self.None, meta={'foo': bar}, dont_filter=True)
We will not get an exception or something like that. The spider will just make a request and use the same function for parsing.
Is it a correct logic? Because I didn't find it in the documentation
