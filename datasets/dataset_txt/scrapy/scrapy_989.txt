I've been working on a scrapy project, and although I'm fairly new to scrapy I've been able to get it to run properly. However, after I tried to get Scrapyd to work, I can't get Scrapy to work either.
I get the ImportError, and can't figure out what to do.
I did a pip uninstall scrapy and reinstalled it, but still the same problem. I can't even start a new scrapy project, I get the same ImportError message. I run Scrapy 1.04. Please help
