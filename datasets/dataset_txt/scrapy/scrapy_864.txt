I want scraping http://www.lagou.com , this is a http website.
some of my proxy servers support http and https, some just support https.
server that support http/https can use in my spider proxy,
server that not support http cannot use in my spider proxy.
I want use https because its more speedy and stable, and most of server I collected is https only.
