Hi,
I've written a python script were I'm trying to invoke scrapy but I keep getting an import error.
I'm following this guide http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html
The script is stored in the projects folder.
Script:
"from scrapy.crawler import Crawler
from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess
from scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings
process = CrawlerProcess(get_project_settings())
process.crawl('linksspider', domain='scrapinghub.com')
process.start()"
Traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "scrapy.py", line 3, in
from scrapy.crawler import Crawler
File "......", line 3, in
from scrapy.crawler import Crawler
ImportError: No module named crawler
I can't find the answer on google/SA/Github.
Can anyone help?
Thanks
