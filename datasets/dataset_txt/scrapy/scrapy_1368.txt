I just struggled for a long time with my Django installation to understand that my problem was coming from Scrapy. When using scrapy as a script and following http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html#run-scrapy-from-a-script , I could not get Django manage.py to run. No error messages were displayed.
I traced down to a bad configuration on my scrapy.cfg [settings] path. That was a simple mistake, however, I was not told, at any moment that I used a wrong path.
I suggest adding some exceptions in utils/project.py for the function get_project_settings().
ps : sorry if I'm not too clear, it's probably the first time I submit an issue/suggestion through GH.
