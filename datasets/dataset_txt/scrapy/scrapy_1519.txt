When multiple eggs are located in /var/lib/scrapyd/eggs//*.egg
I restart scrapyd service
Then I execute the command "scrapy deploy scrapyd -p project1 --version GIT" on the same folder level as setup.py and scrapyd.conf.
However after looking at my application scrapyd hasn't transitioned to the new egg even thought i get a status response of 200 (OK)
How can I check and how does scrapyd decide what egg to load when it's restarted?
Deploying a new egg should make scrapyd load it right?
Thanks,
