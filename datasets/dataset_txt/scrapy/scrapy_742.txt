I read the doc and find the command line should be like this.
scrapy runspider getspecificimg.py -a ip='lizhe'
And my spider code is like this :
class GetImage(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'ImageSpider'
    start_urls = ['https://www.pexels.com/']

# Get the input argument
    # NameNeedSearch = InputPara
    NameNeedSearch = ip
But the result I get means that the ip isn't defined why?
