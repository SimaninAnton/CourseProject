Hello,
I want to download all images on one page and save them in some folder whose name depends on the original request URL.
For example, I want to scrape example.com/123.html
I want to download all images on that page and put them under ./123 folder.
Is it possible ?
How could I pass parameter to ImagesPipeline from my spider?
