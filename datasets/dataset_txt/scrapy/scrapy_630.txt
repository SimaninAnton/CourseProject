The documentation says "processors are just callable objects, which are called with the data to be parsed, and return a parsed value. So you can use any function as input or output processor" and this works in Python 2:
def proc(i):
    return i

class FooItemLoader(ItemLoader):
    foo_in = proc
But FooItemLoader.foo_in is a bound method in Python 3 so it receives a self argument and not just the field value.
