I am trying to sort some data which are not uniformly formated , so i am trying to apply sanitize() but it won't execute and alerts me with the message: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Users\Ayman\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Builds\HeadFirstPython\Chapter5\coach.py", line 20, in
clean_james.append(sanitize(each_t))
NameError: name 'sanitize' is not defined
I am using python37
so i found that this function was removed from this version library ,, so what is the alternative for this procedure in this version ?
this is the code structure :
import os
os.chdir('C:\Users\Ayman\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Builds\HeadFirstPython\Chapter5')
with open ('james.txt') as jaf:
data = jaf.readline()
james = data.strip().split(',')
with open ('julie.txt') as juf:
data = juf.readline()
julie = data.strip().split(',')
with open ('mikey.txt') as mif:
data = mif.readline()
mikey = data.strip().split(',')
with open ('sarah.txt') as saf:
data = saf.readline()
sarah = data.strip().split(',')
clean_james = []
clean_jolie = []
clean_mikey = []
clean_sarah = []
for each_t in james:
clean_james.append(sanitize(each_t))
for each_t in jolie:
clean_jolie.append(sanitize(each_t))
for each_t in mikey:
clean_mikey.append(sanitize(each_t))
for each_t in sarah:
clean_sarah.append(sanitize(each_t))
print(sorted(clean_james))
print(sorted(clean_julie))
print(sorted(clean_mikey))
print(sorted(clean_sarah))
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#5>", line 1, in
clean = [sanitize(t) for t in dirty]
File "<pyshell#5>", line 1, in
clean = [sanitize(t) for t in dirty]
