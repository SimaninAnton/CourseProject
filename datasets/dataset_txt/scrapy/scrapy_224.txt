Hi,
I tried to run my spider on aws lambda.
Then I need to make a zip file with whole scrapy lib packaged.
So I installed scrapy at project folder via below command:
pip install scrapy --target ~/myprojectfolder/package
and import lib in script file(MySpider.py) via
from package.scrapy.http import Request
then I tried to run scrapy via below command:
python MySpider.py
at first it gives twisted import error
then I add below code to /project/scrapy/init.py, above importing _monkeypatches
sys.path.append('./package/')
so the prob is resolved, but I encountered another one.
It stops after below message.
