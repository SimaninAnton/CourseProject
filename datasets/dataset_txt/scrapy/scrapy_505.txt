When I run scrapy shell https://www.zomato.com, I get the following warning:
:0: UserWarning: You do not have a working installation of the service_identity module: 'No 
module named cryptography.x509'.  Please install it from 
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are 
satisfied.  Without the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL to support it, 
Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.  Many valid 
certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.
followed by another warning:
2017-11-13 15:11:37 [scrapy.core.downloader.tls] WARNING: Remote certificate is not valid for 
hostname "www.zomato.com"; u'*.zomato.com'!=u'www.zomato.com'
after which it exits without scrapping any webpage. If I run the same command with https://github.com it works as it should.
The environment details are:
MacOS - v10.13
Python - v3.6
Scrapy - v1.4.0
Twisted - 17.9.0
service_identity - v17.0.0
pyopnssl - 17.2.0
I have kind of hit a dead-end and cannot debug this.
Thanks!
