Let's put together a document with Scrapy 1.0 release notes, it should provide a:
high-level summary of all changes getting into Scrapy 1.0
tips and hints for migration from Scrapy 0.x (even though we'll provide backwards compatibility for most things)
We'll circulate and points to this document (in mailing list announcements, etc) as the go-to place for "what's new about 1.0?"
