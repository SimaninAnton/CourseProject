(just logging the issue before I forget)
It may seem obvious by the name of the attribute that allowed_domains is about domain names, but it's not uncommon for scrapy users to make the mistake of doing allowed_domains = ['http://www.example.com']
I believe it is worth adding a note in http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html?#scrapy.spiders.Spider.allowed_domains
