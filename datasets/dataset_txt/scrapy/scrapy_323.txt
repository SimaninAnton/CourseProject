I want to modify some layer's depth in my scrapy request tree Because some requests is parallel in my program. When I'm using
"depth = response.meta['depth'] - 1 & request.meta['depth'] = depth"
or "meta = {'depth': 1 # start from 1}"
It didn't work.
So I checked the follow link and find the meta['depth'] is not a special key.
https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#request-meta-special-keys
So my question is request.meta['depth'] is set by DepthMiddleware, Can they be mess around and modified by myself ??
Thanks a lot!
