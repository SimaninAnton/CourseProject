I have a lot of errors like this in the error log ( im using sentry ) and they are just pollute the log.
Unsupported URL scheme 'mailto': no handler available for that scheme
Unsupported URL scheme 'about': no handler available for that scheme
etc.
So the log just become very polluted with this errors because there really a lot of them. Is
My spider:
 class ExternalLinkSpider(CrawlSpider):
   name = 'external_link_spider'
   allowed_domains = ['']
   start_urls = ['']

   rules = (Rule(LxmlLinkExtractor(allow=()), callback='parse_obj', follow=True),)

   def parse_obj(self, response):
     if not isinstance(response, HtmlResponse):
        return
     for link in LxmlLinkExtractor(allow=(), deny=self.allowed_domains).extract_links(response):
        if not link.nofollow:
            yield LinkCrawlItem(domain=link.url)
If there somethin wrong with my spider that could be fixed to stop producing this error, please advice.
