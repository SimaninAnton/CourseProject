Can we please bring back the docstring comments in CrawlSpider that were removed in e2290a5? The code has zero comments now. Just spent two hours pulling my hair out trying to pass extra params down the crawler. Until I found the removed docstrings in this commit that where hugely helpful :) Thanks!
