What do you think about renaming BaseSpider to Spider?
"Base" prefix usually suggests that the class is somewhat low-level and most likely shouldn't be used in user code, unless heavy customization is needed.
For example, scrapy has BaseItem and Item, and users should use Item; django has internal models.BaseManager and user-facing Manager, werkzeug has BaseRequest and Request, there are unittest.BaseTestSuite and unittest.TestSuite in standard library, etc.
I think Spider is a better name, because it is fine to use BaseSpider in user code instead of CrawlSpider or other BaseSpider subclasses, but the name suggests the opposite.
