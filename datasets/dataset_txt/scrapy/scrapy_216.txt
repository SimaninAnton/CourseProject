Hi! I use it in my DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES. And cookies are not updated.
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    coookie_dict={'name': 'value'}
    request.cookies.update(coookie_dict)
    request.priority = 99999
    return request
If I use it in the spider code, then everything works
coookie_dict={'name': 'value'}
yield Request(url', cookies=coookie_dict)
How to set cookies for all spider requests (including those that are in the schedule) from my downloader middleware?
