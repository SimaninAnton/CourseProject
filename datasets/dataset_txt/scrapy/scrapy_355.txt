Hi :)
Is it possible to use same spider for different websites at the same time? Lets say I have an original spider which can crawl any website. Then I have a program which calls the original spider at the same time and changes the start urls and the spider name.
I tried with this:
for _ in range(2):
print("Write spider name:")
spider = input()
Spider.name = spider
runner = CrawlerRunner(get_project_settings())
runner.crawl(OriginalSpider)
d = runner.join()
d.addBoth(lambda _: reactor.stop())
reactor.run()
But i have two errors:
when I write the second spider it ends crawling the first one
crawling of the second spider stops somewhere in the middle, doesn't crawl the whole page (if I crawl it separately it work perfect )
