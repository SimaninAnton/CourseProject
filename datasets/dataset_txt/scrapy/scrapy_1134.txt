I ran the following command on my py2.7.10-devel ; pip install scrapy.
It didn't run completely and throwed errors as follows:
Failed building wheel for wheel
Failed building wheel for cryptography
Failed building wheel for lxml
Failed building wheel for cffi
I'm posting a paste of my error log, check it here: http://pastie.org/10404586
