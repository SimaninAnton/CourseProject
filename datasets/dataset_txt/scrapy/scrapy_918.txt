Scrapy runs and does not create new html files for the site it is scraping.
It runs successfully with a (200) message and is able to reach Telnet.
Scrapy is no longer producing new html files and or a separate resource file as suggested here .
I am confused as to why my scrapy crawl $myprojectname is not fetching any new html data?
