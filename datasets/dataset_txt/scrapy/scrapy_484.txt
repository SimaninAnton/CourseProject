I have deployed a spider in my remote server, and I am using FilePipeline to download images for item, however I found that the downloaded image have size of zero, which is not expected.
Then I test the project in my local machine, it worked. So I think maybe my remote server has been banned, however when I tried wget .. I can download the image normally, and I also tried scrapy sheel image_src it still work.
Now I have no idea what's going on , I just want to intercept the response of the request re-sent by the pipeline, is it possible?
