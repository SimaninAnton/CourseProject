Inside the HTML sent back by one website, there's one "a" element structured as such:
a class="title threadtitle_unread" href="showthread.php?t=154247171" id="thread_title_154247171">Here is some text</a
it seems that trying to make a selection based on the class does not work, my initial suspicion is that it has to do with there being a space between "title" and "threadtitle_unread", but my Python's not good enough yet for me to accurately debug it.
EDIT: ignore that there's no opening '<' and closing '>', I didn't know how to get this page to not parse it literally so I left them out
