When trying to send an attachment from MailSender.send() , the attachs argument takes a tuple. If one is passing a single tuple eg, attachs=("header", "text/plain", myFileObject) or attachs=(("header", "text/plain", myFileObject)) , there's a ValueError: exception, only works when passing params in this way: attachs=(("header", "text/plain", myFileObject),)
