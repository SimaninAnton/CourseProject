I currently have a CrawlSpider to crawl through a website, but I needed to change it to InitSpider in order to get an authenticated session.
With CrawlSpider, it would correctly crawl all of the pages, but would fail on the ones that required a login.
With InitSpider, it successfully logs in, but then does not do anything else.
I know InitSpider used to inherit from CrawlSpider, but I'm a little unhappy with the (hacky) solution posted here:

(the last post with 2 votes).
As the poster there asked, is there another solution?
Thanks in advance!
