If a cached response is returned when the page is considered fresh without requesting file,
it will return the response immediately. Thus, no download scheduling is performed, and hence download_delay does not used at all.
However, when I want to repeatly check if a page, by request the same url in the parse function, then no delay exists. That makes the problem.
