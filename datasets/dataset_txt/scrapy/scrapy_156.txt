Hi team, according to this article, there are 3 methods that are accepted in form's method attribute. I can't remember about other methods, but I'd agree to consider the rest of REST verbs if that's common. Anyway, I think it should be a good idea to whitelist the accepted methods to avoid scenarios like this vulnerability exploitation that took advantage of form's method.
This issue affects FormRequest.from_response and the affected line is:
scrapy/scrapy/http/request/form.py
Line 51 in a3d3804
 method = kwargs.pop('method', form.method) 
I want to know if there some reason behind this behavior, otherwise I could send a pull request.
