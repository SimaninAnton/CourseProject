I may be wrong but,let me explain:
In our init.py code we are terminating the program if the Python version is less than 2.7
After that we are applying monkeypatches, which again checks for Python version(if it is Python 2.x it applies some tweaks to fix some bugs).
What's the point of checking of the python version again in monkeypatches if we already know it is greater than 2.7?
