Quotes from http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/versioning.html:
Scrapy uses the odd-numbered versions for development releases.
So far, only zero is available for A as Scrapy hasn’t yet reached 1.0.
API stability is one of Scrapy major goals for the 1.0 release, which doesn’t have a due date scheduled yet.
