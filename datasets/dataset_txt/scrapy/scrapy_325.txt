"FF for scraping" section (https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/firefox.html) is outdated, e.g. none of the suggested "Useful Firefox addons" work. Firebug is discontinued, XPath Checker is removed, all other extensions don't work with recent Firefox.
I think it should be re-written as "Using Firefox developer tools for scraping", or just "using browser developer tools for scraping" - all browsers have developer tools these days, and these developer tools work about the same.
