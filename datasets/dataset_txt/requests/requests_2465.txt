from requests import get

if __name__ == '__main__':

    invalid_url = 'http://_/'
    req = get(invalid_url,
              config=dict(safe_mode=True),
              return_response=False)
    res = req.send() # throws ConnectionError
The reason is catch_exceptions_if_in_safe_mode() decorates request() which calls Session.request() which does not call Request.send() when send_request is False which is the case with async requests. I guess we should decorate Request.send() not request()
