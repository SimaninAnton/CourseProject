Using a website that has a self-signed cert, the following use of verify=False fails:
import requests
s = requests.Session()
r = s.get('https://selfsignedsite')
traceback
r = s.get('https://selfsidnedsite', verify=False)
traceback is the same about SSL3 not finding a valid cert
requests.get('https://selfsignedsite', verify=False)
traceback as above
