When we use stream=True to cap the size of the response, we lose all the bells and whistles of the response object once the response is consumed. For instance, we can no longer return the response to the caller then inspect status_code.
In keeping with simple is beautiful, it would be terrific if we could do:
requests.get(url, max_response_size=1024*1024)
Thanks in advance for considering it. :)
