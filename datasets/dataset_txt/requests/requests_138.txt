I'm floating this idea because currently our native ssl module support isn't being utilized by any requests users and I'm planning on making major improvements to SNI within native ssl support in urllib3 including leaning on the stdlib for hostname verification. What are the thoughts on only using pyOpenSSL when urllib3.util.HAS_SNI is false?
