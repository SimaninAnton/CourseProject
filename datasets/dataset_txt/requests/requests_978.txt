Hi,
Today our automated builds started failing because 2.11.0 was pulled and 386382b causes a request's body to be a bytes object in Python 3 but a str in Python 2.7, which is breaking both my code and https://github.com/seanbrant/requests-wsgi-adapter:

Can this be made a bit more "backwards-compatible"?
Cheers,
