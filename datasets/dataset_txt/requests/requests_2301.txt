Using the following simple server to simulate a streaming http service, requests 0.14.2 doesn't stream the response. it waits until some amount of data is received or until the end.
The client
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:8000/a/b/c'
req = requests.get(url, prefetch=False)

for line in req.iter_lines():
    print repr(line)
The server
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
import time

def simple_app(environ, start_response):

    status = '200 OK'
    headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')]

    start_response(status, headers)

    for i in range(10):
        yield "line %d\r\n" % i
        time.sleep(1)

httpd = make_server('', 8000, simple_app)
print("Serving on port 8000...")
httpd.serve_forever()
