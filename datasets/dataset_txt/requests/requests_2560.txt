This seems to be a similar issue to that described in #440.
This is a regression since Requests v0.7.6 (well, that's the previous version I was using), which did not quote cookie values containing a / character. The session cookie that I send to an internal web service stopped working when I upgraded to 0.10.4. The server does not recognize the quoted cookie value sent by 0.10.4. Unfortunately I have no control over the server, so I think changing requests is my only option.
