I would like to request support for Socket Secure protocol. There exists a fork (https://github.com/dvska/requesocks) with this capability, but it is limited (python 2 only).
Currently the AssertionError: Not supported proxy scheme socks5 is thrown when attempting to connect to a socks5 proxy.
A quick Google search (https://www.google.nl/search?q=socks+proxy+list) illustrates the popularity of the protocol. Even Tor and I2P use it.
