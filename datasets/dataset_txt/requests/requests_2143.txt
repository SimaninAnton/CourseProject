Hi,
Since Python 2.7, the ssl module implements a way to provide a list of available ciphers to the SSL object [1]. It would be nice if this feature could be reflected in Requests (and in Urllib3 as well).
I know it's not a key feature but some web servers have a Long Handshake intolerance [2] and that makes tools (and Python scripts) based on OpenSSL 1.0.1+ fail at handshake. A workaround is to provide a short list of ciphers instead of all the available ones.
I've looked into trough the Requests documentation and googled. I didn't find a way to do it. Maybe there is, if so i would appreciate a bit of help :)
Thanks !
