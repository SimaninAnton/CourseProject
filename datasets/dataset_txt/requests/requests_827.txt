Hi, firstly thank you for the awesome module that you have here. I've been using Python 3.4.4 on an app I created about 2 months ago and recently ran into some issues with requests. The following is the traceback displayed when attempting to run it after compiling it into a windows executable using PyInstaller 3.2 using requests v2.12.x (all patches). I have downgraded to requests v2.11.1 as that version compiles and runs without errors. I thought I'd give you the heads up as I couldn't find a similar issue and solution anywhere.
Thanks
