Hi,
I have Python 3.7.1 and requests 2.19.1 installed and I am doing a POST to an endpoint that returns 302, apparently requests.post is not sending the body.
If I run this, it works fine:
response = s.post('https://my-url', headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
But when I run the code bellow, it fails:
response = requests.post('https://my-url', headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
I get this response from the server:
'{"message":"Required parameter tag is missing"}'
Which in my case would either mean a bad JSON object payload or an empty request body. Checking the server logs, I can see that the request body is empty.
Is this behavior expected? Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks in advance.
