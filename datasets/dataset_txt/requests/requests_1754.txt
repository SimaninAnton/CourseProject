Is there any guideline on selecting chunk size?
I tried different chunk size but none of them give download speed comparable to browser or wget download speed
here is snapshot of my code
r = requests.get(url, headers = headers,stream=True)
total_length = int(r.headers.get('content-length'))
if not total_length is None: # no content length header
for chunk in r.iter_content(1024):
f.write(chunk)
Any help would be appreciated.?
