Am doing some testing for HTTPS certificates, and am seeing some unexpected behaviour from the requests "session" object:
import requests
# www.ottg.eu has a known invalid https certificate:
requests.session().get('https://www.ottg.eu', verify=True)
# raises error as expected

session = requests.session()
session.get('https://www.ottg.eu', verify=False)
# as expected does not raise, prints InsecureRequestWarning, 

session.get('https://www.ottg.eu', verify=True)
# unexpectedly, this seems to ignore the verify parameter, and it does not raise
# it also still prints the InsecureRequestWarning
That doesn't seem right?
tested against requests 2.18.4 on ubuntu 17.10
