I'm having poor performance getting the following URL using requests:
http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org/json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dhimmel.com%2Firreproducible-timestamps%2F
The following notebook screenshot highlights the issue:
Less than a second using urllib.request.urlopen but 15 seconds using requests.get. I've evaluated curl and my web browser, which both retrieve the response quickly. It looks like the holdup is on {method 'recv_into' of '_socket.socket' objects}.
Any help would be appreciated.
