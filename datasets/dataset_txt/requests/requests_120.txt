Look under http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response - raw attribute is not listed, even though it's described in http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#raw-response-content , etc.
Expected Result
The API reference should be complete.
Actual Result
See above.
Reproduction Steps
See above.
System Information
The model.py has it like this (f37daf2):
        #: File-like object representation of response (for advanced usage).
        #: Use of ``raw`` requires that ``stream=True`` be set on the request.
        # This requirement does not apply for use internally to Requests.
        self.raw = None
Note that last comment line doesn't start with #:. Maybe that causes the entire comment block to not be treated as doc-comment and the field is excluded from docs.
