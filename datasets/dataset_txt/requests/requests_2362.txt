Sending a request with a large request body (i.e. a large file that is being multipart-encoded) will consume a large amount of memory.
It would be very helpful if it were possible to specify a file-like object (and the content-length separately) and request as well as its helper libraries read only the chunks that are needed to continue sending the request.
