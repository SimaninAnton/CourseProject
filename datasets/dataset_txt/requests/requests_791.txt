Hi
I was using requests flawlessly till yesterday I realised I cannot send large packets to https server getting following error
requests/adapters.py", line 473, in send raise ConnectionError(err, request=request) requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine("''",))
Turns out my ISP started filtering ICMP fargmentation needed packets and drops large packets. Otherwise packets would have been fragmented and retransmited. Shouldn't requests fragment packets with respenct to MTU or MSS to prevent this from happening?
Is there a work around to this problem?
