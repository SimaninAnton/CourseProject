For my code, there is an import at the top:
from settings import Settings
I need to install the settings module but whenever I try to install it, I get this error message:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement settings (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for settings
Does anyone know how this can be resolved?
