requests.get('http://example.com', headers={'foo': 1})
requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader: Header value 1 must be of type str or bytes, not <class 'int'>
It would be good to add the name of the bad header to make it easier
to track this down in large bodies of code. Something like:
requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader: Header foo value 1 must be of type str or bytes, not <class 'int'>
Thanks.
