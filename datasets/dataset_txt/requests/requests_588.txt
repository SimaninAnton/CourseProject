I installed the current master by pip install zipfile in a recent python3 conda environment
base_url = 'http://............127.0.0.1:8082'
request.get(base_url)
crashes
and ends with an UnidodeError
python3.6/encodings/idna.py",
line 165, in encode
raise UnicodeError("label empty or too long")
UnicodeError: label empty or too long
May be you can catch this?
