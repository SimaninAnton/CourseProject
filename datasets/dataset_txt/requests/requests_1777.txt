HTTPS posts requests don't work on AppEngine.
Specifically the code here:
http://documentation.mailgun.com/user_manual.html#sending-via-api
(I removed the parts not making a difference):
requests.post("https://api.mailgun.net/v2/samples.mailgun.org/messages")
Results in a 404 (not found), which is wrong since it is clearly available.
I read a lot about requests' AppEngine support and the problems with urllib3 but I came to the conclusion that according to what I read it should work now. :)
Unfortunately I couldn't find any other service, where I can test a HTTPS Post.
