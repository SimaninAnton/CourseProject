This addresses the issue of exceeding the max number of open files.
This provides a simple, elegant way to make sure connections are closed after use.
Add enter and exit to Response.
e.g.
with requests.get("someurl") as r:
... # do something with r
And alternative would be to provide a configuration for requests to automatically close connections after the response is created and contents retrieved. This would be useful in application where all responses are known to be short and chunking retrieval will not be used.
