I am trying to enable verbose logging with my request string and I am getting the following error:
"request() got an unexpected keyword argument config"
I have tried searching but have not found a fix for this and I followed the following directions:
my_config = {'verbose': sys.stderr}
requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', config=my_config)
2011-08-17T03:04:23.380175 GET http://httpbin.org/headers
<Response [200]>
Thanks
