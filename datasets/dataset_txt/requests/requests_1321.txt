        """Returns a dictionary of the headers to add to any request sent
        through a proxy. This works with urllib3 magic to ensure that they are
        correctly sent to the proxy, rather than in a tunnelled request if
        CONNECT is being used.  

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
