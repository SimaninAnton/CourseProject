#2442 updated the certificate bundle and appears to have dropped Thawte from the bundle. Thawte still shows up for me both in the Mozilla bundle and the mkcert.org standard bundle. Mozilla appears to have been unchanged recently: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/log/a2ffa9047bf4/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
So I'm not sure how this happened, but it's broken using requests for Rackspace's cloud API, and I'm sure other sites as well.
