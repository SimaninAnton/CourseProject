It is possible to set the HTTP_PROXY in CGI scripts by passing the Proxy header. If the script uses requests to download files, requests will happily use the attacker-supplied proxy to make requests.
This should be mitigated like it is in Perl (since 2001), Ruby, and libraries like curl.
I confirmed that HTTP_PROXY (in uppercase) is accepted as well as the conventional, lowercase http_proxy (requests 2.7.0)
