At line 550 in file models.py, I found the code like this:
... sep='; ' ...
There is one space character after semicolon character. so that the result of cookie string in the header like this:
airkey=; clientkey=; clientuin=; confirmuin=0;
There are two space characters after ";".
I checked IE and Firefox that are just generate one space character after ";".
And, some website can not recognize the formation of cookie which have two space characters as separator.
