I have published a new PyPI module, https://github.com/kislyuk/requests-http-signature, to implement the IETF draft for HTTP signatures (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-07). This draft RFC formalizes the use of symmetric (HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256) and asymmetric (RSA-SHA256, ECDSA-SHA256) message signing in HTTP.
Is there interest in bringing this module under the requests organization?
