I'm trying to connect to a site which uses TLS 1.2 using reqests package in Python 3.5. In Chrome I get the warning that the certificate chain for the website contains atleast one certificate that was signed by using SHA-1.
I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "<ipython-input-51-e43bc1030cea>", line 1, in <module>
    f = s.get(url)

  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\requests\sessions.py", line 480, in get
    return self.request('GET', url, **kwargs)

  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\requests\sessions.py", line 468, in request
    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)

  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\requests\sessions.py", line 576, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)

  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\requests\adapters.py", line 433, in send
    raise SSLError(e, request=request)

SSLError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:646)
Requests version is 2.8.1 and Python version is Python 3.5.0 :: Anaconda 2.4.0 (64-bit)
Is there a fix to this issue or has come across something similar? I have tried connecting to the site by forcing the TLS version after this blog form one of the contributors to Requests package, but I still get the sam error. Upgrading certs on the site is not an option now.
