Over in the Apache Tika Python Port I'm noticing in tika-python#44 and in tika-python#58 some odd behavior with requests on Python 2.7.9. For whatever reason, when using a file handle and putting it with requests.put it blocks and blocks until finally it gets (correctly) a BadStatusLine back after a timeout. Anyone else seen this?
