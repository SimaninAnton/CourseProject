Hi,
I've been tinkering with the following issue for the last couple of days and boy it was frustrating.. The issue is not being able to sent requests after you've changed your external IP adress while inside a sesison. It took me a while to figure this out.
Like I said the problem only excist if you're inside a session for some reason the requests are just stuck, for ever. I tested the same thing without a session and that works just fine.
