Hello,
I currently in the process of trying to upload a file to a specific Google Drive folder. I have tried creating a JSON object as indicated by the Drive api, and set it as the JSON attribute in the call, however my file still gets sent to the root directory, named as "Untitled".
Here is my code:
title = files_to_send[0].name.split('/')[-1]
request_body = {'title':title, "parents": [{"id": path_id}]}
status = self.call.post('https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files', data=files_to_send[0], json=request_body)
Thanks!
