Calling response.close() does not seem to release the connection back to the pool. I'm only using the headers or even just status_code, so the content doesn't get downloaded, I call response.close() but then the next request opens up a new connection.
Is there a reason for this? It seems that the documentation is insufficient at the very least, if this is intended behavior.
