Response.raw is stated to be a 'file-like' object (comment here) however a change between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 means that a new parameter (decode_content) was added.
The change was made in the following commit: 59f916c
This is no longer compatible with 'file-like' objects, as it relies on the urllib3.response method signature.
This breaks libraries which override response.raw, such as the tests in github3.py (see this issue on github3.py: sigmavirus24/github3.py#112)
