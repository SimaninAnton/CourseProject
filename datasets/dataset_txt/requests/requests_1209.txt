According to this:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#the-start-response-callable
The response object must contain a status field with string values such as "200 OK" or "403 Forbidden" and so forth. If one is developing a Python WSGI compliant API then any framework used (such as falcon) is going to require a status field is set correctly.
I am deploying a python app behind WSGI (falcon) and I use the requests module to perform requests on behalf of the API consumer (it's a special use case to sign requests going to Amazon Elasticsearch using signature 4 that I did not want to try to write in JavaScript) and as a result I have to take the response object from requests and take values contained within to construct a WSGI compliant response.
Currently I have to concatenate the status_code and reason fields from the requests response object to in order to construct a PEP 0333 complaint response status. A field added to the requests response object would save this extra step.
This is a "nice to have", not a serious priority.
