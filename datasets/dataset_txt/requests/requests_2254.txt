When the servers redirects (302) and the redirect url already has params in it, requests just adds the params once more, doubling them:
session.py: 82
    url = resp.headers['location']
it already contains the params in it:
session.py: 111
    resp = self.request(
            url=url,
            method=method,
            headers=headers,
            params=req.params,
            ...
now it glues them again on the url.
