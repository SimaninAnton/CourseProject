While trying to figure out how to set specific path attributes in cookies when using requests, I noticed that RequestsCookieJar hardcodes the root path when cookies are created and doesn't seem to allow this default to be overridden.
Is there a reason for this? If not, would the maintainers be open to a PR modifying create_cookie to heed a path specified in kwargs?
