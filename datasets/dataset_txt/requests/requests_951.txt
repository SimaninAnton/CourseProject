I have some code that calls like
r = session.get(url, stream=False, timeout=1)
data = r.content
This is called in a loop for 150 urls constantly. Usually this works but after a while I get errors like
('Connection aborted.', error(105, 'No buffer space available'))
This is over an ipsec tunnel so I suspect the bug is with the tunnel but wanted to make sure.
Thanks
