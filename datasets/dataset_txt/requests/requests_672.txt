Hi,
I use GAE - Google Application Engine - and my project raises error during 'import requests' when it is ran under GAE sandbox (locally).
GAE doesn't have _winreg in sys.modules and the _winreg is called by platform.py. In platform.py: system() function -> uname() -> win32_ver() -> import _winreg.
'platform' now is used in requests/utils.py after the commit 'proxy bypass on Windows without DNS lookups' by @schlamar.
I don't know why GAE doesn't import _winreg. It seems GAE was developed in Unix-like platform.
If I copy an old requests version to my project (without import platform) and it works nice.
I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Requests project or Google.
Regards,
Andr√©
