While I'm not entirely certain of the problem, this reproduces in our environment with an obscure (unrelated to requests) import error.
I've confirmed this was introduced in 2.5.2 and exists in 2.6.0, as well as 1f0e577
If I had to guess, I'd say its related to this:
Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.
