Hi there! Apologies that this probably isn't the ideal place to file this, but I think there's a documentation error at http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#make-a-request.
Where it reads "Now, we have a Request object called r", I think it should be "Now, we have a Response object called r", per the code and a test like this:
requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
<Response [200]>
