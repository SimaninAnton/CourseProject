The introduction to requests claims,
Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic
The page on sessions contradicts this, and heavily implies that I need to create a Session object to get pooling:
if you're making several requests to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase (see HTTP persistent connection).
If I need to create a Session in order to achieve connection poolingâ€¦ that doesn't seem "100% automatic" if I must manually ask for it.
Use of the library seems to indicate that Session is the way to go, because I'm getting spammed by "Starting new HTTPS connection" logs.
