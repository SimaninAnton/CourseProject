The response header documentation claims that the headers dict will contain a 'status' entry, containing both the return status and the reason, for example '200 OK'.
In my tests, no such entry exists in the headers dict, although the same data is available with a combination of (assuming a response object called 'r') r.status_code and r.reason.
