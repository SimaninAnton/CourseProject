I would like to do something equivalent to the following. I have looked through the documentation and the source code and it does not currently look like this is possible, but feel free to tell me if I'm wrong. I realize this is a redundant example, but it's the clearest way to illustrate my problem. My real use for knowing the HTTP verb from a requests object is for writing my own AuthBase, since our auth needs to know what type of method is being used.
r = requests.get('http://some.url.com/endpoint')
print r.verb
>>> 'GET'
