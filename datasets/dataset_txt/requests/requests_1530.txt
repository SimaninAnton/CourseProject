This is a follow up from #2399 (comment)
As stated there, this is a problem which has to do with requests being used in both a main process and forked processes -- the rq worker script. If the network goes down even for a short while, requests raises few exceptions (ConnectionError) then it becomes unusable and the forked processes get killed instantly if they try to use it (requests.get). The issue is described on the rq side as well: rq/rq#473
Sorry if this not very clear, tired now and I'm struggling with this issue for few weeks already...
I've put up a gist to reproduce it (https://gist.github.com/ducu/ee8c0b1028775df6c72e), but please let me know if I can help. Thanks a lot for your support, cheers
