The documentation says that Response.elapsed is "the amount of time elapsed between sending the request and the arrival of the response". However it is very unclear what this actually means - the time to the first byte of the headers, the time to the first byte of the body, the time to the end of the body, etc? What value does it, and the other corresponding values in the Response.history list's objects, have if the response involved one or more redirects? Does it change if you access Response.content? Does it make a difference if stream is set on the request? A great deal more clarification on what this value actually tells you would be very helpful.
