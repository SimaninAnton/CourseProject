I am getting an annoying warning message from requests library. Everything seem to work fine except that the message is extremely annoying and I'm having a lot of them. That's how it looks like.
Exception ignored in: <generator object iter_slices at 0x7f332d3cf990>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mqu/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests/utils.py", line 449, in iter_slices
    def iter_slices(string, slice_length):
SystemError: error return without exception set
This is the only line where I'm using requests in my program, I'm just sending JSON to different servers once in a while.
 requests.post(url, json={'command': command, 'arguments': arguments}).json()
Could this error message be more descriptive? What can I do to make it go away?
Anything else I can provide to you to help me identify the cause?
Thanks in advance.
