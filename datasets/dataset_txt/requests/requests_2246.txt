I've been using requests in our application for a while; however, recently we've been working on interfacing with payment providers. We've been running into an issue where they use and older firewall/proxy combination that only allows TLSv1, in openssl versions prior to 1 this wasn't a big deal as it would initiate with a TLSv1 request. Beginning in OpenSSL version 1.0 this is no longer the case, and the negotiation process begins with SSL3, this causes these older devices and web servers (older apache) to just throw an EOF or fail the handshake. We need a way to specify an ssl version or negotiation starting point, so we can directly use requests with these older devices. This isn't probably much of a problem for many people; however, I did see a past issues #900, #851, #701, and #606. This isn't a problem on Mac OS X mountain lion unless you install openssl 1.0.1c (security needs), but it's now present by default on Windows and most Linux/Unix variants.
