If an event is added that isn't "response", during req.prepare() a KeyError is thrown.
The error is difficult to track down and relates to the copying process of hooks from the request to the PreparedRequest.
There should either be a better error message displayed. I.e. hook event not supported
Or, as is in my pull request ( #1524 ) the RequestHooksMixin.register_hook method should handle creating the event.
