Summary.
I was trying to get data from a website by using requests module in my spyder3.2.4.
I used requests.get() to realize the goal.
It worked well. But, recentely, when I used requests.get(), spyder would pump out errors.
Really confusing.
What you expected.
import requests
r = requests.get(url)
r.status_code
200
What happened instead.
AttributeError: module 'requests' has no attribute 'get'
import requests
System Information
$ python -m requests.help
<paste here>
This command is only available on Requests v2.16.4 and
greater. Otherwise,
please provide some basic information about your system (Python version,
operating system, &c).
