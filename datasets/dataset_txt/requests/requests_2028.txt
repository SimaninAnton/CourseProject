I'm trying to figure out how to get proper english/ascii error message from a failes requests.get. for some reason (probably being working with a hebrew locale), I get a jibrish unicode error message. I can deocde the message and display it correctly in hebrew, but I really prefer (for various reasons) that the Exception error text would be in english.
checking Requests Exception source code doesn't even lead me in the right direction, Since I seem to be I'm getting a different exception:
(10060, some encoded error text,')
and the class is: <class 'socket.error'>.
So I guess we are probably looking at a socket.error from socket lib. At least as far as I can tell from parsing the Exception args (I can't raise the exception directly, only while running the app, where I do a smelly except Exception as e and parse e.args and e.message).
So:
how do I set the locale so that requests (or the underlying socket lib if my guess is correct) would return an english/ascii error message?
Thanks for the help!
