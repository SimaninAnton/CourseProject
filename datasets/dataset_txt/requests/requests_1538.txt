The docs:
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification
say:
By default, verify is set to True. Option verify only applies to host certs.
If my HTTPS connection is being verified by default, why am I also seeing a InsecureRequestWarning? Clarifying this situation and updating the docs with more info would be helpful IMO.
