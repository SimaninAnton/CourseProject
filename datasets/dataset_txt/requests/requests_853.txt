The patch filed by @tiran in #3713 seems to have broken docker-py. They're using a custom URL scheme (http+docker), which we previously applied URL preparation to but now do not. This has therefore busted what they were up to in v2.12.2.
I'm not immediately sure that we have a good way out of this. Prior to this patch docker-py users were probably at risk of encountering issues because the HTTP requests to the Docker API can be routed across unix domain sockets, which may entirely fail to contain hostnames and also fail to IDNA-encode. So I'm not sure that we don't need docker-py to route around this a different way.
