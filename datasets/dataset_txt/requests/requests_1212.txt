Using request.head() I want to get the content-type of a page before proceeding. Unfortunately for me, the request header content-type returns text/html. But if after completing the requests using request.get()
the content type is application/octet-stream.
I have suspected the web server but using urllib2 with a head request it return application/octet-stream
Here is my code and the exact url to reproduce the same error:
>>> import requests
>>> u = "http://holo-pack.com.tw/download.phpx?soft=ea70"
>>> r = requests.head(u)
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'text/html'
With request.get() the header is "application/octet-stream" so with urllib2 as seen here: pect https://filippo.io/send-a-head-request-in-python/
