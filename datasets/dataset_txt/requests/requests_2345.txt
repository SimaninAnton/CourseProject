This is a feature request.
It would be very useful if the requests package included a round trip time attribute on responses received. pyCurl includes this functionality via pycurl.TOTAL_TIME.
This can be worked around currently with something like this:
gc.disable()
start = time.time()
request = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
total = time.time() - start
gc.enable()
request.total_time = total
However, it would be nice to have this attribute generally available. I am not sure if the garbage collection disable/enable is really necessary or not.
