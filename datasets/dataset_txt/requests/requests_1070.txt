I could not use your lib in CeontOS 7 with Python 2.7.5. I got this error:
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 576, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 447, in send
    raise SSLError(e, request=request)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: ("bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines', 'SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE', 'certificate verify failed')],)",)
Updating of Python or any SSL libs didn't help. I've got this error in CentOS and Ubuntu, in Arch Linux everything works well.
