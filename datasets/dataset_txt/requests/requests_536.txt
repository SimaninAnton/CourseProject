Summary.
Basically HTTP 301 redirection replaces POST method with a GET.
More Info: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/99894/why-doesnt-http-have-post-redirect
Need an config option in python requests to override this behavior and follow redirect method after http redirection.
Thanks
Raja
