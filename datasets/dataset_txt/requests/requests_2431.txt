Web Linking RFC
GitHub uses these for pagination in their API for example. Potentially they make API’s more self describing and discoverable.
I’d like to invite the discussion of requests making an effort to consume these and expose them on Response.links as a dictionary or dict-like object.
A HTTP Link header looks like this:
Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
     title="previous chapter"
It’d be cool to access the links like so
response.links.previous
>>> Link <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2> title="previous chapter"
Maybe this belongs in a requests-hypermedia library.
