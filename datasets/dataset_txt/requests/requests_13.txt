response=requests.post("https\myserver",auth=('admin','****'),verify=False), i got following error log,
requests.exceptions.ProxyError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='xx.xx.xx.xx', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /myserver (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', OSError('Tunnel connection failed: 504 Gateway Timeout')))
