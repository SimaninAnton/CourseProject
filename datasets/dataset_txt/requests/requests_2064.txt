I am dealing with a legacy platform that does not understand URL encoded parameters.
I have the following parameters
params = {'fiz': 'foo:bar', 'biz': 'barfoo'}
url generated by requests
http://localhost/?fiz=foo%3Abar&biz=barfoo
required url for the legacy platform
http://localhost/?fiz=foo:bar&biz=barfoo
I tried creating a custom query string and adding that to the url, however requests will decode this query, and re-encode it.
improt urllib
qry = urllib.urlencode(params).replace('%3A', ':')
requests.get(url+'?'+qry) #: requests encodes the colon back to %3A
Is there any quick work around that doesn't look as verbose as using straight urllib2?
is it possible to get a "safe" or "replace" list hooked into the API, this would need to be done at the requests layer as python 2.7 is required.
