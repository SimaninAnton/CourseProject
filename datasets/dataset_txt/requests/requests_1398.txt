If I am running a custom certificate authority I might want to generate a TLS certificate that encodes its subjectAltName using an IP address (iPAddress in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6). this is useful when I do not have DNS records for servers in my application but I still want to validate identity.
Unfortunately, the hostname validation logic requests uses does not validate these records. It only validates DNS records within subjectAltName.
