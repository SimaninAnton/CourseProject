urllib3 had a bug, we accidentally pulled it in, we didn't catch it because we don't test with SNI support (should we have that as a separate build?). Happily the awesome @t-8ch has already provided us with a patch, which is already merged, so we don't necessarily have an action on this: it'll be quietly fixed in the next release. Just raising this issue so that people who look on the issue tracker see it.
