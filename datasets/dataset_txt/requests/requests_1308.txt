Hello, I came across this code under status_codes.py:
for (code, titles) in list(_codes.items()):
for title in titles:
setattr(codes, title, code)
if not title.startswith(''):
setattr(codes, title.upper(), code)
in the first line (the outermost loop), i think the list(_codes.items()) step is redundant. it should just be iterating over _codes.items(). what i am not sure is if the items method here returns a list (python 2) or an iterator/generator (python 3). if its the former, maybe its better to loop over _codes.iteritems(). In either case, you do not really need to convert it to a list.
Though this is a very small issue, if its worth doing a PR, I can do it. (in that way, i can contribute my first PR to the requests library :) )
