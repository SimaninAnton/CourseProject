Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:
to reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;
to enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
to enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.
to enhance source code appearance (for example, by disallowing overlong names or unclear abbreviations).

Without prior knowledge into Python syntax, Bash syntax and the name of the module, error fixing took several extra hours to solve. Another nail in the coffin.
Thank you for a great module regardless of name. It provides one of the strongest features I need in a bot that checks URLs. Too bad I have to be a wizard to swish and flick my wand to fix the errors.
