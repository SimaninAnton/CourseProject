Hi,
I am not sure exactly where this should go (here or https://github.com/requests/requests-ntlm/) so I will post it in both places.
I have been using requests-ntlm (post-version 0.0.2.2) in conjunction with requests 2.2.1. Recently I upgraded to requests 2.3.0 and found that NTLM authentication no longer worked; every request was rejected with 401 Unauthorized.
Side-by-side debugging of 2.2.1 vs 2.3.0 yielded the result that this deletion causes a connection not to be put into the pool. I can fix this by patching requests-ntlm but I am not familiar with either library, so while I know that this will solve my problem I wanted to mention this here in case it might be related to any other problems to do with requests.
I'm happy to provide debug logs or further details.
Many thanks
