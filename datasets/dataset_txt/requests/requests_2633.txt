Logging messages in connectionpool.py are set to level warning, and there appears to be no clean (eg. in config/defaults) way to silence them (please correct me if I am wrong about that!).
Currently, after importing requests I am doing this:
logging.getLogger('requests.packages.urllib3').setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)
It seems a bit inelegant though. Is there a better way?
