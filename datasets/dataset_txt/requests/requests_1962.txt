I believe it'd be nice if we could have the option to define more than one authorisation methods in a request. It is useful in cases where one is not aware of the auth methods the servers supports.
The way it could work is by polling the server, finding out which methods it supports and picking the best one to proceed.
i.e auth=[HTTPBasicAuth(user,pass), HTTPDigestAuth(user,pass)]
I'm OK to submit a patch.
