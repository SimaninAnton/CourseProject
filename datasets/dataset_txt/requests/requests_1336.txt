This is a somewhat trivial thing, I ran into a "bug" while grouping responses by reason instead of status codes. This is of course a very particular case but just to be consistent it may be a good idea to have response.reason always be "NOT FOUND" instead of "Not Found", "Not found", "not found" etc.
