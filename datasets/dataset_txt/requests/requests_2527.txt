def iter_lines(self, chunk_size=10 * 1024, decode_unicode=None):
iter_lines() uses chunk_size, rather than that it would be better if \r\n is used, iter_lines() is used when connection is open for long timing, I recently tried the example(twitter streaming api), code - http://kracekumar.com/post/19556427690/n00bs-epic-research-on-twitters-streaming-api-on snippet found exception like String Index Out of Range.
