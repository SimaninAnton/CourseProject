I've noticed that requests adds a user-agent header by default that looks like the following: python-requests/2.7.0 CPython/2.7.9 Linux/3.14.44-32.39.amzn1.x86_64.
Including the CPython and OS kernel version are an unnecessary information leakage that could have security implications, as per the OWASP documentation.
I would like to suggest the default is changed to follow the 'bot' convention described here with the requests version and a link to the requests documentation: python-requests/<version> (http://http://www.python-requests.org/).
