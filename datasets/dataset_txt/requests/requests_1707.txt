Hi, the link which describes pip and easy_install's difference in docs/user/install.rst are obsolete.
But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.
But I found that this page is not available in pip's document any more, maybe we should point this link to some place else instead?
