While hanging around the IRC channel today, a user came in with an HTTPS request that was not completing. It turned out that he didn't have ssl configured properly on his python 3 installation (here's looking at you ArchLinux).
It would seem to me that failing quickly as opposed to just hanging there would be far more useful. Admittedly you would hope an advanced user would know if they have SSL installed or enabled, but someone just starting out might not. I know urllib3 smothers the Exception they get when importing ssl, but would anyone object to throwing a custom Exception when users try to make HTTPS requests?
