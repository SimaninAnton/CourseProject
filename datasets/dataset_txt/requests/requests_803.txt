I'd like to verify that a URL will be valid for a HTTP request. The main motivation is telling the user in the GUI that the typed URL cannot be used.
Currently, I'm using requests.models.parse_url, but this is obviously not enough because PreparedRequest.prepare_url performs additional checks (e.g. host.encode('idna')). It would be great if the same checks were exposed as a public API.
