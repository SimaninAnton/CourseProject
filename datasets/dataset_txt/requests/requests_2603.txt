Hey. Newb user here. I've just spent about 30 minutes figuring out how to use the config API to set 'danger_mode' = True.
The docs don't seem to show this (or at least, I couldn't find it)
I was trying all sorts of wrong things, based on what I saw in the docs under 'Configuration API Docs' (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#configurations), such as:
import requests
requests.defaults.danger_zone = True
In the end I resorted to looking in the source.
I think the docs need a short sentance and example of setting a config option.
Many thanks.
