Hi, all. I'm trying to update some documentation regarding the sunset/"end of life"/EOL of Python 2.x and ran into a question regarding Requests. Could you confirm that Requests does NOT expect to drop support for Python 2.7 in 2020?
Context: python3statement/python3statement.github.io#194 suggested that https://python3statement.org/#sections30-projects add Requests as a project that will drop support for Python 2.7 in 2020, but referred to a hint on the Requests homepage that has since been removed. Requests is currently listed as a participating project in the Python 3 Statement. The Python 3 support section of the FAQ does not mention an estimated date for dropping Python 2.7 support. I see in #5199 (comment) that @nateprewitt said:
Requests has a large user base with varying needs which means we'll need to maintain 2.7 support for sometime beyond EoL. Once pip is migrated to being Python 3 only (no ETA to my knowledge), we would be able to consider it, but there aren't any concrete plans at the moment.
In this discussion of pip's plans for deprecating 2.7 support it does seem to me that there's no concrete timeline yet. And that implies to me that perhaps Requests should be removed from the Python 3 Statement list of "Participating Projects: These projects pledge to drop Python 2 support in or before 2020."
Is my understanding correct? If so I'd like to submit a PR to remove Requests from the Python 3 Statement.
Also, I suggest that we add a "Python 2 support?" question to the FAQ, and once I know the answer to my question above, I will be happy to contribute that as a pull request. Thanks!
