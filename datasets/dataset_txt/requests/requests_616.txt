The latest update (2.16.0 and 2.17.3) to version check chardet has broken one of our sphinx docs tox tests on travis.
  File "/home/travis/build/cas--/Deluge/.tox/docs/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/__init__.py", line 66, in <module>

    major, minor, patch = chardet.__version__.split('.')[:3]

AttributeError: type object '__version__' has no attribute 'split'
I have no idea how/why this is occurring but it's your new code in __init__.py that is breaking when version checking chardet.
