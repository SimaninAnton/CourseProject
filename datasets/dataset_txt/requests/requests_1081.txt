>>> r.request.headers["User-Agent"]
'python-requests/2.x.x CPython/x.x.x Linux/3.xx.xx-generic'
I think requests is sending too much info.
The bot name `"python-requests" would be okay.
But my Python version which may be vulnerable ?
My Linux kernel version which may be vulnerable?
I consider this a big problem. Many people using requests may not be aware of this and inadvertently sending this info.
Please just change the the User-Agent to something like
"python-requests" or "Requests"
