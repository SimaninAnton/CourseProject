The urllib.proxy_bypass implementation on Windows is using forward and reverse DNS requests. This can result in major performance issues (I guess this depends on the DNS server, right now I have seen delays up to 15 seconds!). Additionally, this behavior is contrary to all major browser implementations.
This could even be a security issue as people might rely on the proxy as a privacy feature and in this case the client shouldn't do any DNS requests as this could leak private information.
I would recommend using a custom implementation which isn't doing any DNS request.
