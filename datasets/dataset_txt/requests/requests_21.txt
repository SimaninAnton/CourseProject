I need to read a http stream (with head multipart/x-mixed-replace), the content-type is image/jpeg,how could i do?
r = requests.get('http://192.168.1.100:4747/mjpegfeed?1920x1080', stream=True)
c0 = r.content
code [c0 = r.content] will wait until response finish, but this response is not going to finish.
so what can I do?
