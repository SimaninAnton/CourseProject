Trying to access the response.contents in an async setting and, f.e. pass them to a variable, fails somehow:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-x86_64/egg/gevent/greenlet.py", line 390, in run
result = self._run(_self.args, *_self.kwargs)
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-x86_64/egg/requests/models.py", line 569, in send
self.response.content
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'content'
<Greenlet at 0x102584eb0: <bound method Request.send of <Request [GET]>>(prefetch=True)> failed with AttributeError
However, printing the response via hook methods works correct...
