Hello,
when passing a proxy with authentication, and where the password contains the character '#', the parsing of the URI is broken. For instance:
proxy = "http://user:%23Cpassword%23C:server:port"
ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='user:', path='', params='', query='', fragment=password#@server:port0')
This is caused by the url = unquote(url) done before the parsing in utils.py.
I believe the URI should not be unquoted before the parsing, rather the username and password should be quoted after the parsing. What do you think?
Thank you
