Salesforce.com requires you %hex encode period (.) and slash (/) to issue a PATCH.
The unquote+quote cycle in requote_uri(uri) disallows this: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/utils.py#L398
Since it's not prohibited by the http spec (see uri comparison at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.2) but some web services like salesforce.com won't allow the unquoted values for period or slash, could this be disabled? I'm glad to issue a pull request for disabling it but figured that I'd ask first for background before assuming I knew why this was here.
