I need something that does exactly what RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params() does. This works in both python2 and 3:
>>> RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params({u'a': b'b'})
'a=b'
Can it be made part of the public API? (Or is it already?)
I am aware that I can just use it as is. But that seems "wrong".
