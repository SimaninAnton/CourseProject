This could arguably be classified as a bug rather than a feature request.
Requests doesn't, as far as I can see, supply an API to return the server's HTTP reason phrase. What it instead supplies is an API that will return its own stringification of the server's HTTP status code.
While in many cases these will probably be the same, I am writing a reverse proxy, so I want to return to my client exactly what the origin server supplied to me.
For example, if the origin server said "200 Everything Is Awesome" instead of the more common "200 OK", then I want to return precisely "Everything Is Awesome" (not "OK") to my client in my reason phrase.
Note that the HTTP RFCs permit origin servers to supply custom reason phrases:
The reason phrases listed here are only
recommendations -- they MAY be replaced by local equivalents without
affecting the protocol.
By my reading, the HTTP RFCs permit anyone to supply any bytes they like other than CR and LF in this 'reason phrase', and still comply with HTTP.
