Currently requests does figuring out of whether a proxy should be used for a given URL. WPAD/PAC files describe those requirements, so if requests were to support WPAD proxy descriptions it would need to also parse it and figure what proxy to use for what URL.
On the other hand requests could delegate that task to libproxy and clean up a bunch of code (and issues) from the project.
