When I post a big file to a server with invalid authorization, the server response with a 400 error response and with "Connection: close" header before read all the request body and then close the connection, requests still send message body and get connection aborted exception, but according to RFC7230, the client SHOULD monitor the network connection for an error response and immediately cease transmitting the body and close its side of the connection.
