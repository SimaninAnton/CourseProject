I am talking to an app with a custom auth module that I've written. The auth object installs a hook, and if the response fails and indicates that the auth object is expired, I get a new auth object.
I'd like to be able to retry the exact same request with the same settings as the previous request but with a new auth object from my response hook. This means I'd like to be able to make the request as part of the same session (ideally) but to also have access to the initial request parameters such as verify.
