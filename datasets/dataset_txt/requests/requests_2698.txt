Function calls like func(*args, arg=val, **kwargs) raise a SyntaxError in Python 2.5 (tested in both 2.5.2 and 2.5.6)
I have a patch for the issue here:

Let me know if you would prefer a pull request of that commit.
The rest of my changes are working around a bug in the urllib2 in Python 2.5.2 that was fixed in 2.5.4 so are not very useful to anyone else.
Cheers,
Dan
