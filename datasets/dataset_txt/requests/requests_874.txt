Starting with urllib3 1.17, ndg-httpsclient and pyasn1 are no longer required to inject pyopenssl into urllib3. cryptography and idna are required instead. The result of this is if an older version of pyopenssl is installed and you run pip install requests[security], you will see import errors when trying to inject pyopenssl.
