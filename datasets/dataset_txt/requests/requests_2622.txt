In the latest versions of requests, passing bytes to requests.request and all helper functions (for example requests.get('http://google.com', params='q=test%20me')) will trigger the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 50, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 38, in request
    return s.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 190, in request
    r = Request(**args)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 86, in __init__
    self.params = dict(params or [])
ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required
The last known version of requests where code like this works fine is 0.7.6.
