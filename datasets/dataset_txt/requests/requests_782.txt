Hello,
My code:
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer '+access_token}
payload = {'grant_type':'refresh_token','refresh_token':refresh_token,'client_id': client_id, 'client_secret': client_secret}
resp = requests.post(url,headers=headers,data=payload).json()
I am trying to get refresh token as mentioned in the docs for Envato API.
When I run this code I get the following response:
{'error': 'invalid_request', 'error_description': 'Unsupported authorization method: '}
Can anyone point out as to what I am missing here?
As per the docs I need to make a POST request to get the refresh token.
POST https://api.envato.com/token
     grant_type=refresh_token&
     refresh_token=[REFRESH_TOKEN]&
     client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&
     client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]
