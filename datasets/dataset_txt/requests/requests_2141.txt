I'm working in a Com Server DLL where I use requests to make POST a multipart form along with some XML file.
Localy, it works great and with no error. I can call the COM object methods and it returns me what I'm expeting to.
Now, when I use py2exe to build a dist version of the app, and try to register the DLL Com Server with regsvr32, I get the following error:
"Runtime Error!
...
R6034
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrecly.
..."
Also, I've noticed that if I remove any reference to the requests library in my python code, I don't get this issue (obiously, I've lost the main functionality of the module).
