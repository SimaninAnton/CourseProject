I am trying to invoke a api which is sitting in a load balancer server. The server uses certificate chain which i downloaded from browser in .p7b file and passing in my code
r=request.get(uri,headers=header,verify='certificate.p7b').
Even I tried generating .pem file through openssl commands, but it didn't work. I also tried using "verify=False" sttement. But getting the same error:
Please help.
