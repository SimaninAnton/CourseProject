In the Quickstart document, the JSON Response Content section says:
In case the JSON decoding fails, r.json raises an exception. For example, if the response gets a 401 (Unauthorized), attempting r.json raises ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded
This is a bit misleading, especially that the json() method makes no attempt to validate that. It is accurate to say that failure to decode JSON will result in an error being raised. However, receiving 401 does not necessarily mean that JSON decoding will fail. Some APIs might return a JSON object in the response body (e.g. { 'error': 'Unauthorized' }), in which case r.json() will work fine.
