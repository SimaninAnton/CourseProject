Urllib3 released a new version today which has some breaking changes for Python 2.6. While we work out any other possible incompatibilities Requests will remain compatible with urllib3 1.21.1 to 1.23 for the next week.
If you’re experiencing issues due to pip’s dependency resolution, you will need to pin ˋurllib3==1.23` in your package requirements.
