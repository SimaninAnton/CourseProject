I am considering adding type annotations to Requests to help my team do static analysis of code that depends on it. Would a pull request containing type annotations be merge back?
More info on type annotations:
PEP 484: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/
mypy, the type-checker of choice these days: http://mypy-lang.org/
Given the need to support Python 2.x, the preferred format for annotations would be as Type Comments, but I would be open to do .pyi stubs if that makes it easier for everyone.
