On my mac,
import requests
r = requests.get("https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check")
generates this stack trace:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "requests/api.py", line 55, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)
  File "requests/api.py", line 44, in request
    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
  File "requests/sessions.py", line 383, in request
    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)
  File "requests/sessions.py", line 486, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "requests/adapters.py", line 389, in send
    raise SSLError(e)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:507: error:1407742E:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert protocol version
which seems to skip a few lines that raised the exception in urllib3. Perhaps we could use six.reraise() here for python2/python3 compatibility?
