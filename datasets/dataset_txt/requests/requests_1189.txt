Right now, the requests.post() function only appears to send post requests to HTML elements by their name. Are there any plans of creating something like a requests.post_to_name() and requests.post_to_id(), so that the user can make post requests to HTML elements via their id instead, similar to the API used in Splinter for accessing HTML elements?
