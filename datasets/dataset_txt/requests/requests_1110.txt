Hi,
For example, I want to upload a video called "测试中文视频.mp4", which will be converted tofilename*=utf-8''%E6%B5%8B%E......, the problem is that my working server does not recognize this format, so, is there a method to tell requests to convert the request message to like this: filename=测试中文视频.mp4 or like this: filename=u'\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6587\u89c6\u9891.mp4'.
Thanks very much!
