Hallo requests devs (and thanks for an awesome lib)
During a specific requests.post I most of the time get a requests.exceptions.Timeout (on timeouts) but I also sometimes get a socket.timeout exception. Since there is a requests exception for it, I assume that the socket exception was supposed to be caught and the requests one raise instead. The full stack trace is:
Traceback (most recent call last):

The development is for a plugin for the music service Wimp for the SoCo project, which means that I could post code to reproduce, but you will not be able to run it without a Sonos speaker and a Wimp subscription. I understand if this difficulty to reproduce may mean that you cannot work with this issue.
Thanks in advance Kenneth
