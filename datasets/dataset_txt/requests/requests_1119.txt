This question came out when I tried to validate some proxies.
If proxy-scheme is uppercase as follows, it will return 200. (The host of proxy is not a true one.)
import requests
proxy = {
'HTTP': 'HTTP://111.1.11.1:8000'
}
r = requests.get('http://www.sina.com',proxies = proxy)
print (r.status_code)
However, if changing 'HTTP' to 'http', it will raise an error about httpconnectionerror.
So, it is confused me that proxy-scheme is case sensitivity or not? Or something went wrong about my code ?
Hoping to receive your instruction.
