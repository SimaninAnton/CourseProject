Built something with dribbble's API recently and noticed this.
This very may well be the fault of dribbble, but I don't know enough to diagnose. It works in browsers and curl, so it seems something's up with requests.
ssllabs shows the cert presented as a wildcard certificate https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=api.dribbble.com
However when connecting with requests 2.5.0 on python 2.7.8 an SSLError is raised
SSLError: hostname 'api.dribbble.com' doesn't match either of 'dribbble.com', 'www.dribbble.com'
