Hey!
I am using this library and when I wanted to use request.post() method I was taking data parameter as a dictionary to it and I got some errors, so I read the documentation of this method that says :param data: (optional) Dictionary, list of tuples, bytes, or file-like object to send in the body of the :class:`Request`.
I change my dictionary to a json string and it was ok!
why this method doesn't accept a dictionary data type?
