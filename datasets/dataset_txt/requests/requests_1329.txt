In making a request to a third party resource, https://www.example.com, I am getting the following traceback:
import requests; requests.get('http://www.example.com')

Traceback (most recent call last):
 (......traceback.....)
  File "/Users/python3.4/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 415, in send
    raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(54, 'Connection reset by peer'))
For reference, I am on python 3.4.3, using requests 2.7.0, and running on Mac 10.9. What is very strange about this issue in particular is that the same call works if i run 'curl -i https://www.example.com' or if I access the URL using a browser. I believe it has something to do with the SSL handshake
