This is supposed to download a partial chunk of the URL (bytes 1000 to 2000)
target = 'http://10.0.0.10/words.txt'
headers = {'Range':'bytes=1000-2000'}
r = requests.get (target, headers=headers)
print r.text
It's not working and I get the whole file.
It does however work with the standard library's urllib2. I believe the problem is in the way requests is sending the request, since the server's logs show a difference in the response code.
The full code and some server configuration information here (I've tried the commented out things). I've also shown the code I use for urllib2.

I am using 2.0.1 of requests.
>>> import requests
>>> requests.__version__
'2.0.1'
