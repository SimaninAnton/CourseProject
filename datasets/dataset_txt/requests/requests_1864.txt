I use r.context, it is bytes type, then I use r = requests.get('http://github.com'); print(r.text), but an error occurs as below:
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xb7' in position 235: ordinal not in range(128)
is it a bug in python 3 ? I use requests 2.1.0 version in openSUSE 13.1 x86_64.
Thanks
