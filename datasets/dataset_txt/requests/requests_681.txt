Hi, I'm using Requests version 2.14.1, but I'm having problem with HTTPS request when using proxies.(works fine with http url) My proxies are already ip authorized. I'm novice to programming so I cant exactly figure out what I'm doing wrong.
import requests, random, time
proxies_list = [
    '104.153.xx.xxx:xxxx',
    '104.153.xx.xxx:xxxx'
]
while True:
    try:
        r = requests.get('https://icanhazip.com', proxies={'https': 'http://{}'.format(random.choice(proxies_list))})
        print (r.text), time.sleep(0.5)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
