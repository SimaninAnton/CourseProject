Hi All,
I'm trying to debug why sometimes my requests fail (Doing some perf test through locust.io) but I can't find the cause. My nginx logs have no error attached and what I see is requests giving status code 0.
I thought it could be timeout but I timed the request and I see <1sec.
Is there a way for me to find out why I'm getting this behavior?
I'm basically getting status_code==0 but I can't find a reason to that.
I'm using python 2.7 and locust to run the perf test
