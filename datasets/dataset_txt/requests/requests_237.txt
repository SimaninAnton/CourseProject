"Requests is not accepting feature requests at this time." I see.
But really guys, would it be too much to ask to get this implemented into the Sessions? I could submit a PR. Axios and many other libraries support this already, and it comes it really handy.
I know there are workarounds, subclass it and what not but that is so ugly when it could be built into the module with ~5 lines of code.
Please ðŸ’¯
Thanks
