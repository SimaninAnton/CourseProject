I would love to have a function that would iterate over the chunks that are received, as they are received on the socket. It would work like socket.recv() works in the python standard library.
This would be very good for an easy way to consume the stream as efficient as possible. It would be awesome if we could update __iter__ to use this function as well instead of using iter_content with a fixed length of 128.
This has been discussed to some extent in #844 but that issue got closed because of inactivity. I opened this to be a more focused issue. If we feel that this is a good approach I could hopefully help implement it as well.
