With the latest pyopenssl on Windows 64bit:
cryptography==0.2.dev1
ndg-httpsclient==0.3.2
pyOpenSSL==0.13
pyasn1==0.1.7
I get an exception raised when GETing a 301 response to a HTTPS request. I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is decoded to a Unicode string. Then requests passes the response to resolve_redirects which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.
I Wrote this test:
    def test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
and this is the result of py.test:
