When encoding a boolean into a URL encoded parameter:
payload = {'foo': True}
resp = requests.post(path, params=payload)
Requests currently generates: ?foo=True .. I would expect the boolean to be encoded as a 1 or 0, e.g. ?foo=1 , as some clients may not understand True as a boolean.
I did some google searching, and I am not even sure if there are rules for how a boolean should be encoded, I didn't find any specific guidelines, just that a lot of URL encoding libraries seem to always encode booleans as 1's and 0's.
Apologies if this is known and/or expected behavior. I'm not a web guru by any means, but at the least, Requests does seem to be handling it differently than other libraries I've used in the past.
