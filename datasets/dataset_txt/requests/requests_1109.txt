I am reading the official document of requests. There is one code in quickstart.rst
>>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}
>>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)
>>> print(r.url)
However, the output is
http://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key2=value3&key1=value1
instead of what is in rst?
Is this a small mistake?
