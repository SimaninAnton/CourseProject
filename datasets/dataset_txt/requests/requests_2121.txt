I'm trying to upload files to server, let's take this simple page as example:
http://fiberdk.horus.feralhosting.com/
this page will get .torrent file and it will fix it if it's broke, I would do something like this:
url = 'http://fiberdk.horus.feralhosting.com/'
files = {'torrent': open('torrent.torrent', 'rb')}
r = requests.post(url, files=files)
but this didn't work for me, and all i can get from googling is the same results.
