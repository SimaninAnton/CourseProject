It's sometimes necessary to see not only boolean SSL certificate validation status but also SSL certificate contents. It would be nice to have a way to access the SSL cert as dict() available from Response or Session objects.
P.S. I can add that as I've written a module to do exactly that http://ipsec.pl/node/1068
