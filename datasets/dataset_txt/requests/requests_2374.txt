It seems streaming requests (as per example given here) do not raise an error when the connection is dropped or when there are network problems that prevent the stream from being consumed. This makes it difficult to know if we should reconnect to the stream.
If an error was raised, then disconnections could be handled gracefully, e.g.
while True:
    try:
        for line in r.iter_lines():
            if line: # filter out keep-alive new lines
                print json.loads(line)
    except ConnectionError:
        # reconnect...
