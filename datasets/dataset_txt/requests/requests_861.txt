Some of the older changelog entries, starting at 2.4.0 and working backward, mention that the urllib3 version was bumped but don't say what version it was bumped to.
This can cause mildly annoying dependency resolution problems, especially if you partake in unsavory activities such as:
Installing requests from an RPM source that doesn't vendor urllib3
Running extremely outdated versions of requests/urllib3
It would be useful if the changelog included these details (as newer changelog entries do).
I'm happy to put in the time to do this, but probably not immediately.
