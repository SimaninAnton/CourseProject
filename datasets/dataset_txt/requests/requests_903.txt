I work on a python project that uses requests. And as a developer, I have set that enviroment variables: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE so I can see all of my requests with mitmproxy. Today, I have decided to use session.send() method with a prepared request instead of using .get(), .post() or .request(). But then, I realize that .send() doesn't respect my environment variables.
So, I think that merge_environment_settings method should be used in .send() method, instead of .request(). What do you think about that? Should I open a pull request for that?
