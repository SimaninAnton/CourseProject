Hi again!
This issue is related to the closed issue #2383
I have now investigated further. I have tried a different client agains the server, and this communication works fine. I have used wireshark to see how the handshake goes. With the java client things works out fine, but when using requests, the connection terminates with an Encrypted alert after the change Cipher spec.
When I look at protocol in Wireshark, I see TLSv1 even if I change protocol using the SSLAdapter in the requests_toolbelt. Is this correct?
I use OpenSSL 1.0.1h 5 Jun 2014.
Could it be wise to try a different OpenSSL version? Which version is compatible with requests version 2.5.1?
Regards
Tor Erik
