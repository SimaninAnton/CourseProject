Quickstart section "raw response content" does not say about the requirement: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/docs/user/quickstart.rst#raw-response-content
Also API docs at http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/ missing this requirement
(requirement introduced on 0.13.6)
