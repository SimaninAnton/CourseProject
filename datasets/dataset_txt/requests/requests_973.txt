Apologies for the vague header, I'm still narrowing this down. It appears that this commit (7700eca) is using self.reason, and in our implementation, its throwing errors for a missing attribute 'reason'.
The lib in question is django_openstack_auth; all our tests began failing when 2.11.0 released. 2.10.0 still works fine. I'm unsure whether this is an issue with a clumsy test implementation on our side or a false assumption on the requests side. Will keep digging.
