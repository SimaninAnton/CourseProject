Hi
I'm using the request module in combination with request-kerberos. Since the server i'm querying is behind a load balancer it often happens that the authentication is done with host1 and the query on host2, leading to error 401 Unauthenticated.
I manage to workaround this problem this way:
host = socket.gethostbyaddr(random.choice(socket.gethostbyname_ex(host)[2]))[0]
Don't know if i should open this issue in requests-kerberos as well.
