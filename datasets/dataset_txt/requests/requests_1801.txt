Session.resolve_redirects unconditionally accesses Response.content, to make sure that all of the content has been consumed, so the socket can be reused. If you are manually following redirects, and you have set stream=True, and you use Response.iter_content to consume the entire body of a redirect before cycling to the next one, this access of .content will throw a RuntimeError.
This appears to be fixed by pull request #1944; I'm filing this bug anyway to record that it is a bug (and to make clear why "except RuntimeError: pass" is needed).
