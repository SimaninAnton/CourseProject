I'm using requests module in my app but when i run it in google app engine, raise SSL Connection exception:
File "/base/data/home/apps/s~myapp/1.385939809966824449/lib/requests/adapters.py", line 429, in send
    raise SSLError(e, request=request)
SSLError: Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.
I google this problem and read some answers that said SSL module is not in GAE while list.
I can send a simple GET request with urllib. It was ok.
What is equivalent of requests.request('GET', request_url, params=params, files=files) in urllib?
