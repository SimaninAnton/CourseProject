I am making a request using:
r = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPDigestAuth(username, password))
but this shoots back a 401. However, when I use the cURL command:
curl --digest -u username:password url
it works and I receive the correct response.
Is there a difference between cURL's "--digest" tag and the HTTPDigestAuth class?
