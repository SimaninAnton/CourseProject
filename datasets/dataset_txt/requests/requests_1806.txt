Using the YouCompleteMe (YCM) project with vim I ran into a problem that seems to come from Requests and running on FreeBSD 9.2-STABLE. The traceback I am running into:
Exception in thread Thread-10 (most likely raised during interpreter shutdown):
Traceback (most recent call last):

Requests is embedded within YCM as a Subproject, currently @ 3373548.
What kind of additional information do I need to provide to be able to track down what goes wrong here?
