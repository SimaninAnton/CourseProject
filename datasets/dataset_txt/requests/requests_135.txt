If you’re still experiencing this issue prior to 2.12, it’s likely another issue because we did not use idna to validate hostnames at that point. We’d need a concrete example to do anymore debugging here. I’m going to close this for now since this seems like a usage inquiry for unsupported behavior. If you have a use case that’s causing this with a URI that conforms to spec, please feel free to reopen. Thanks!
