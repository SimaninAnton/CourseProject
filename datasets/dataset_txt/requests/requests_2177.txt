This is a very interesting issue.
I need requests on the place I work, and I do not have administration rights. For that reason, I install it using python setup.py install --user .
Actually, I can log in on two different computers: one is where I actually do my work, and has Python version 2.7, the other is the server from where I need to run my program, which has Python 2.4.3
I managed to install it on the working computer (Python v2.7), but it won't work on the server (Python v2.4.3). The error I get is: python setup.py install --user Traceback (most recent call last): File "setup.py", line 6, in ? import requests File "/home/S12/tomoiac2/bin/kennethreitz-requests-3e72f23/requests/__init__.py", line 52 from . import utils ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Any ideas on why this happens and how it can be solved?
Thank you very much
