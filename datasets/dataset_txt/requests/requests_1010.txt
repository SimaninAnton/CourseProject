What I have tried
I already search on Google,
and tried “grequest”, but grequests document is not enough, I don't know how to use it correctly.
What I am trying to do
what I am trying to do is send about 1000 http GET request,
and then use "beautifulsoup"(python module) get content I want.
Why I need send multi request once
send them one by one is just too slow
I want send as much as possible, maybe 30 requests in a batch?
I am crawling a website, so there are really no way to cut down request number..
Lastly
Thanks for you time on reading this post 💃
oh, I just found out requests and grequest is same author, awesome.
