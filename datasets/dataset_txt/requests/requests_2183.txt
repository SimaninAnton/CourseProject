I sent this by e-mail - no response. I think this might be of interest to others:
I have a problem when connecting to a site. Here's the scenario:
I enter a login page, which has a form
I send (using Requests) a POST with the username, pw, etc.
(This POST includes the SESSIONID)
The webpage with a 302,
To which requests does automatically a GET to the new address
In Firefox, this works, In Requests, I get redirected to the
login - page (with another 302).
The only important difference I can detect is that in point 4),
Firefox repeats automatically the SESSION ID, which Requests does
not do. Can I enable this?
I solved the problem by disabling automatic redirects, and creating
a new request manually, with the sessionid cookie. Now the process
runs successfully.
This confirms the necessity of the repeating the cookie in the
request after the 302, but it defeat the 'neatness' of the auto
redirects.
Cheers,
John
