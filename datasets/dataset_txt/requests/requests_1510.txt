Hello,
I wonder if RAML
http://www.sitepoint.com/raml-restful-api-modeling-language/
http://raml.org/
couldn't be use to create (scaffold) an API console sample.
This idea is probably out of the scope of requests but we could talk about such idea here.
Same idea for server:
flask-restful/flask-restful#394
Kind regards
PS: I'm writing this about RAML but maybe API Blueprint https://apiblueprint.org/ or Swagger http://swagger.io/ are also good candidates
