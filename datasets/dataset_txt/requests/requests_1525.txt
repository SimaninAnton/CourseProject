After merge of #2379, to allow filenames to be int types, unicode filenames are no longer recognized under Python 2.
This checks that the filename is a builtin str, which has different behaviour on Python 2 and Python 3:
requests/utils.py:118: if name and isinstance(name, builtin_str) and name[0] != '<' and name[-1] != '>':
In requests/compat.py, builtin_str is defines as str, which is non-unicode bytes in Python 2 and unicode in Python 3. Perhaps the check should be against basestring, or is this change in behaviour intended?
