It would be really nice if there was a way to do a multipart encoded file uploads without having to load all the files into memory before sending the request so that it could be streamed.
I'm pulling a large file from one place (using requests.get(stream=True)) and have to send it somewhere else as part of a multpart post, but I'm running out of memory.
