Currently certs.where expects a file name that is then passed along and eventually opened. This means it is up to the caller to deal with eggs, wheels, install locations, zip_safe vs not etc, to eventually figure out where something is going to end up on the file system.. None of these issues are particularly fun. Instead of certs.where could return a file like object and a custom implantation could be as simple as StringIO.StringIO(pkgutil.get_data(__name__, 'cacert.pem'))
