Method 'get' with not empty params ends with error:
File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 524, in get_host
port = int(port)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '7766?test=s'
It is probably caused by invalid parsing of port in method get_host.
