For an example I have a Flask app, it gets 'url' parameter from GET request. Then it do something like this:
requests.get(params['url']).text
So how to avoid localhost requests? Should I make a new network interface, which can access only external network and then send requests? I tried to search some answers for that and I found only https://github.com/JordanMilne/Advocate/ but the autor says that we shouldn't use it in production. So how to properly secure from SSRF in case like this? Can requests do requests through specified virtual network interfaces?
