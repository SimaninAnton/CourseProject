Hi, i'm sorry if this is written incorrectly - unsure if feature requests are really allowed, so if they're not just simply delete the issue.
A small annoyance i've found which isn't a problem specifically with requests is when a webserver uses a 302/301 redirect when they should be using a 307 or a 308. This happens a lot with common webservers as more and more websites have http -> https redirects.
This can be a problem when doing anything that isn't a GET request, as request's resolve_redirects code will change the request method when the webserver isn't using the correct http status code (or is trying to preserver backwards compatibility.
My suggestion is to add an argument to a request that allows people to not rebuild the method in the case of redirects.
I have written the code (and test) for it if anybody is interested to look at it.
