This might have something to do with the 2.4.0 release and using certi but I have no idea. Similar to #2255 I am seeing an issue with executing the samples on the readme.
Why this happens with a non ssl request, I have no idea.
import requests
 r = requests.get('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python')

This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.
