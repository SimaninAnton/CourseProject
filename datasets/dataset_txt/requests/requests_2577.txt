It would be great if requests would call unicode() on the URL parameter before using it, so that users can pass things masquerading as URL-strings, like an object from the excellent and extremely useful library furl.
This would turn this code:
requests.get(furl('http://example.com/ ').set({'query': 'string'}).url)
Into this:
requests.get(furl('http://example.com/ ').set({'query': 'string'}))
Which currently raises AttributeError: 'furl' object has no attribute 'find'.
Also, as a side note, it would be cool if you could use schema-less URLs and requests would default to http://
Edit: unicode(furl_obj) or str(furl_obj) is the same as furl_obj.url, by the way. That's what I mean when I say it's "masquerading" as a string.
