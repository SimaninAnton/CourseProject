In some instances, requests is used to access services via SSL that disable TLS v1.0 for security reasons but there is no way to configure what SSL/TLS versions are acceptable nor pass in a SSL context. This is very disappointing.
For example, I need to be able to create this context and use it, but I can't...
import ssl
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1
