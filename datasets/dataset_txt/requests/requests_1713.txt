After looking at this StackOverflow question, I realized that our documentation about Event Hooks is wrong. Specifically,
If the function doesnâ€™t return anything, nothing else is effected.
It makes sense to me that a callback would not be required to return anything for it to be a successful hook. There's two avenues to fix this:
Make the behaviour match the documentation
Make the documentation match the behaviour
Both are easy, but it depends on what we want the behaviour to actually be.
