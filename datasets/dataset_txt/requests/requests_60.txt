I am trying to do a basic authentication using the code
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
import csv
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings()
r = requests.get('https://partnermarketplace-qa-adm.dmzmo.xyz.corp/export/Orders_Entries.csv',stream = True , verify = False ,auth=('bwp', '00k'))
But I am getting the below error:
The same code works on my friend's anaconda but I am getting the issue - not sure if it has something to do with proxy.
Please help
