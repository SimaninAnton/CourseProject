I'm using requests 0.7.4, and am having a strange problem with a GET that is digest protected.
The request takes a long time (2-3 minutes) to come back, and when it does, I get this:
hooks.py:38: UserWarning: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
warnings.warn(str(why))
401
HTTP Digest: Access denied.
The same request works fine in a browser using the same auth credentials.
