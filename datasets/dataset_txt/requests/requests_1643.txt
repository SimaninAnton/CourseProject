I am trying to send get requests to this url: http://data.sfgov.org/resource/rqzj-sfat.json, which will return a etag in the response header, but I just couldn't get it using requests' get method. This is what I did:
>>> r = requests.get('http://data.sfgov.org/resource/rqzj-sfat.json')
>>> print r.headers.get('etag')
>>> None
Every other fields are in the response header, except for 'etag'. Not sure if it's a bug or I missed something.
