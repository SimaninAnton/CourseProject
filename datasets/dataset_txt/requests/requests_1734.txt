Hi,
When I try to run this, I get an SSL error:
import requests
full_url = u'https://qascore.percolate.com/api/pull_request/'
requests.get(url=full_url)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 5, in <module>
    requests.get(url=full_url)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 55, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 44, in request
    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)

    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)

    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 382, in send
    raise SSLError(e, request=request)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 8] _ssl.c:507: EOF occurred in violation of protocol
I'm using requests==2.3.0.
I don't have the error when using http of course.
