This server
import time

request = 0

def application(environ, start):
    start("200 OK", [])
    global request
    request += 1
    if request >= 5:
        return ["GOODBYE\n"]
    time.sleep(1)
    return ["HELLO\n"]
seems to fails immediately with:
session = requests.Session()
session.mount("http://", requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=5))
session.mount("https://", requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=5))
session.get("http://localhost:8080", timeout=0.5)
(I opened urllib3/urllib3#251 because I assumed it was a urllib3 issue, but he redirected me back here)
