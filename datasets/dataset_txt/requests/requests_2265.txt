I'm attempting to PUT with a zero-length content body. My target HTTP server is (rightly) rejecting the request because requests is not sending a Content-Length header, and the server is interpreting the request as having no body.
By my reading of the RFC, requests should always send a Content-Length header with PUT methods, even if it is 0, as in this case.
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html
Even if requests does not always send a Content-Length header with PUT, it should send one if the content being sent is a zero-length string. I suspect instead of checking for None, or whatever the default body value is, it's checking for "truthy".
