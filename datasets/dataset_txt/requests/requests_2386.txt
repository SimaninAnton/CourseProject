We are currently using requests in a rich client application (still in development). It is indeed a great improvement over urllib2 and friends! Especially it is great that it does verify the server certificate when using https.
The error reporting though is quite lacking - the API reports a single SSLError for any verification failure:
SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
In this case the host name did not match the name given in the certificate but it is not possible to infer that from the Exception. When accessing the same site from Firefox I get
<host.example.com> uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.
The certificate is only valid for <otherhost.example.com>

(Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)
I think requests should report similar information in the result exception for SSLError.
I know this is asking for much since the underlying SSL modules do not do this yet.
