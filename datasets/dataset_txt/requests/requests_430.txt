urllib3 and Requests has different semantic when handling unspecified timeout (which means no keyword arg given)
Actual Result
urllib3
when timeout is None -> no timeout
when timeout is not given -> internal _Default objects is used which leads to socket.getdefaulttimeout()
see https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L373
requests
both None and not specified timeout is handled in same way. urllib3 Timeout object is created
with None values -> no timeout at all while socket.getdefaulttimeout() is ignored.
see https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L431
timeout arg is always passed into underlaying urllib3
Expected Result
I think it should be better handle it same as urllib3. When timeout is not specified on request level then don't replace it with infinite timeout but just pass unspecified to timeout to urllib3
System Information
reported on requests version 2.18.4
