Using this as a place to throw things i find that I like.
Going to use StickerMule, not StickerRobot. Undecided on size or design, yet.
I like the idea of using 99designs to come up with the sticker. Would be far more expensive than doing it myself, but I'd rather be handing out amazing stickers at a conference than mediocre ones (for an amazing project).
