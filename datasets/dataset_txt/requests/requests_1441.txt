It has a serious performance hit and it'd be nice if it was easier to disable than:
if not response.encoding:
    response.encoding = 'utf-8'
I can't stress "serious" enough in the performance hit here. It was enough to cripple the entirety of Sentry's worker cluster which is way under utilization most of the time.
