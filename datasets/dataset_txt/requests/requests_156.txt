Hello!
In some of the Microsoft Bot Framework repos have a dependency on request which has an indirect dependency on Cryptiles. We are getting a warning from a security vulnerability that would be solved upgrading cryptyles to >4.1.2.
It seems like it is an indirect dependency of yours. Any idea how I can fix this vulnerability or plans to somehow upgrade cryptiles dependency?
Thanks!
