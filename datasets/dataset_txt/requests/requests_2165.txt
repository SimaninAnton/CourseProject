The tests caught this purely by coincidence with #1259.
The issue is that we're now passing optional keyword arguments and typical hooks don't expect them causing exceptions to be raised.
In essence, this is a big breaking change and we will have to make it very clear to users that this is in the next version. requests/requests-kerberos depends on this but this is going to break a good amount of people's code.
Admittedly it only rears its head when we try and set the defaults via kwargs in Session.send. Again that's due to #1259/#1258 but @geoff-kruss is right in asserting that those defaults should be passed.
Assuming we keep the addition that causes this, we need a plan how to announce it.
