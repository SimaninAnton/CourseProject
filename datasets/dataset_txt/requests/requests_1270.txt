Hey,
we are missing informations how to stop the requests library from guessing the content type of response.text.
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/?highlight=text#requests.Response.text
For our use case we need the original byte string. The current docs don't explain how to get it.
Please improve the docs.
Best regards
