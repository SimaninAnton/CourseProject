I would like to be able to time HTTP responses, logging the url along with the time taken to a file
It seems like this should be reasonably easy with pre + post request hooks, I havent tried yet, this is mostly a feature request / asking if anyone else had already implemented this as I cant see a mailing list or anywhere to discuss these things.
