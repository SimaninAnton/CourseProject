Please provide a release tag for the repository, so we can clone and use sub-repositories that would use the latest released version.
Currently you have tags with versions, but there is no way of getting the latest release using a single command.
It think it shoudn't be hard to modify the tagging on a new release, even as a script. Thanks.
