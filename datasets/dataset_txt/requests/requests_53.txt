E.g. looking at https://travis-ci.com/psf/requests/jobs/237028717 or some of the more recent builds, we notice that there are issues in installing dependencies during the Python 2.7 build. In particular, the issue arises due to attempting the install more-itertools==7.2.0.
Looking at https://pypi.org/simple/more-itertools/ we find that it does exist and that the hashes do match those in the Pipfile.lock
requests/Pipfile.lock
Line 435 in 1462917
 "more-itertools": { 

However, inspect element on https://pypi.org/simple/more-itertools/ reveals that every version > 5.0 requires a Python version of the 3.X series (>= 3.4 in particular).
The solution is to either lower the used version of more-itertools to 5.0.0 or to drop Python 2.7 support.
Update:
We can see that this was the commit that resulted in this issue (load the second diff and CTRL+ f more-iter). So it seems it was originally kept at 5.0.0. Presumably reverting that is the desired approach?
