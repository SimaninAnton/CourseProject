I'm issuing successive GET requests to a Django server and I get Remote end closed connection without response on the second request. If I pause for one second it works fine.
Expected Result
>>> s = requests.Session()
>>> s.get('http://localhost:8000/'); time.sleep(1); s.get('http://localhost:8000')
<Response [404]>
<Response [404]>
Works as expected without Session:
>>> requests.get('http://localhost:8000/'); requests.get('http://localhost:8000')
<Response [404]>
<Response [404]>
Actual Result
>>> s.get('http://localhost:8000/'); s.get('http://localhost:8000')
<Response [404]>
