When I studied the HTTP Post in the Google Flight, I found the Request Payload is like the following:
[,[[,"aa","[,2,"S"]","18563594632275",5]],[,[[,"b_al","no:73"],[,"b_ahr","no:s"],[,"b_am","aa"],[,"b_qu","0"],[,"b_qc","1"]]]]
However, Python does allow None in array, that means, var = [None, 'something'] is right in Python, but var = [ , 'something'] is wrong. What's more, when I post something via lib requests, there is an error :
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
So, could you please give me some suggestions of how to deal with the Payload? I searched about it, but in other cases the Payload is a list rather than a array like [, 'something'].
