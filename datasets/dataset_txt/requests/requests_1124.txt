vmalloc commented on Mar 27, 2016
In the documentation (see http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.request) it says that specifying allow_redirects to True means that redirecting POST/PUT/DELETE is allowed.
Quick attempts show that the reality is that those requests ALWAYS get redirected as GETs, even when this parameter is True (which it is by default). It seems like the tests here support this claim.
The one commented out test here supports the statement from the documentation, but is commented out (the reason seems to be a bug in httpbin, but no further explanation is supplied)
