oauth library depends on pycrypto library which is not pure Python library (has some c extensions). For this reason pycrypto can't be installed from source on Windows without Visual Studio 2008 installed (needed to compile these c extensions of pycrypto). The simplest solution is to download binary installers and install them using easy_install (pip doesn't support installing of binaries). 32bit binary installers for Python 2.2-2.7 and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.6 are at The Voidspace Python Modules and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.7 is at Compiling pycrypto on Win7-64. Binary installers can be installed in virtualenv - see http://stackoverflow.com/q/3271590/95735
