The current implementation of safe_mode seems to be a source of bugs. In safe mode, many members of the Request and Response objects can be None, so they have to be checked manually. Also,
Would it be possible to reimplement safe_mode by catching all known exception types (RequestException, ConnectionError, HTTPError) at the outermost API level? Then we would respond to exceptions by falling immediately back down to the API level.
The implementation of this catch-and-save behavior could probably be a decorator on each API method.
