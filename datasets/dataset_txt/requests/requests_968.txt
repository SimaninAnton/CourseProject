Using https://github.com/timotheus/ebaysdk-python v 2.1.3 (latest)
Which transitively uses requests...
Requests 2.10 was good, with Requests 2.11 I get:
<Truncated>
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ebaysdk/connection.py", line 119, in execute
    self.build_request(verb, data, verb_attrs, files)
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ebaysdk/connection.py", line 159, in build_request
    self.request = request.prepare()
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 251, in prepare
    hooks=self.hooks,
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 295, in prepare
    self.prepare_headers(headers)
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 409, in prepare_headers
    check_header_validity(header)
  File "/webapps/listing_mirror/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/utils.py", line 756, in check_header_validity
    "not %s" % (value, type(value)))

requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader: Header value 961 must be of type str or bytes, not <class 'int'>
Can't say for sure yet where the bug is (requests vs ebaysdk)... but at least something changed in a breaking manner.
Trying to investigate more...
