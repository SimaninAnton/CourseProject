I'm sending requests to some site using proxy servers for each request another proxy.
I'm not a pro in this sphere, so I'm interested in a such things:
are cookies generated each time while i'm sending requests?
can site (to which i'm sending request) identify my computer based on cookies or another factor and to find out that this request and other ones where made especially from my computer?
