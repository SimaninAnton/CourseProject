As has been noted on the Python Security SIG mailing list, Python currently only includes the deprecated IDNA 2003 codec in the standard library. This is problematic, because IDNA 2003 is forbidden for some ccTLDs, such as .de: instead, the newer IDNA 2008 standard should be used. That standard is implemented in the PyPI package idna.
If we're going to support IDNA 2008, I would like it to not be optional: it leads to a fairly substantial and difficult to debug change, so it should be supported fully. To do that and keep in touch with Kenneth's wishes regarding dependencies, we'd have to vendor it.
I'd like contributors and packagers, particularly @eriol, @ralphbean, and @sigmavirus24 to weigh in with their thoughts here. What are your thoughts here? I'd also, if possible, like to hear from @kjd: while idna is licensed under a BSD-like license that should be broadly compatible with our own Apache 2.0 and so should present no legal blockers to vendoring, I'd still rather do it with the original author's permission than without it.
