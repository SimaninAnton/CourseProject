Hey,
I have been trying to get requests to play nice with the "Socks" module (from http://code.google.com/p/socksipy-branch/). urllib3 and httplib work fine with it, but the requests wrapper does not. Here is an example.
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2012, 21:51:14) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import socks
>>> import requests
>>> socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, 'localhost', 9050)
>>> socks.wrapmodule(requests)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "socks.py", line 107, in wrapmodule
    module.socket.socket = socksocket
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'socket'
>>> 
Hopefully there is a workaround for this :) Socks works with almost every other module, so it makes no sense for it to not work with requests.
