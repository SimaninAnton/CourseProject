I have noticed that requests seems to have some sort of issue with www.sainsburysbank.co.uk
It will block for 2+ mins despite having already received the content. Other tools like curl have no issue.
Below is the console and I have taken a WireShark dump (screenshot attached). If you need the pcapng file then let me know.
Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:24:47) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win 32
>>>import requests
>>> requests.get('http://www.sainsburysbank.co.uk')
