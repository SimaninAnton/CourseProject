Would it be feasible for requests to check the WWW-Authenticate response header and send the appropriate authentication?
I'm trying to build a REST API client for a web service, but found that some of the servers where the service runs require basic auth, while others require digest. I want to, if possible, make it so the user doesn't need to care which one it is.
