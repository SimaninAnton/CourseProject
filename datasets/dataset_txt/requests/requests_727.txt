Is there a way to disable SSL verification at my application level?
I'm using the requests module which allows be to disable it per request level(by setting verify to false) but I wanted to way to disable for all requests. I'm running my tests against my local emulator, so I don't need that check and hence want to disable it at my application(test) level.
I'm looking for something like process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0" as used in Node.js
I'm on Python 2.7
