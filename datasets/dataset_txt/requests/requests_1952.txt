Requests doesn't catch requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError and translate it into a requests module specific exception which derives from RequestException as it does for other errors originating from urllib3. This means if trying to catch any exception derived from RequestException so as to treat it specially, the urllib3 ProxyError will be missed.
