It would be nice to have a default timeout for all requests within a session. Currently, this isn't possible because timeout is only taken as an argument to Session.request. As a workaround, I am using something similar to the following:
class TimeoutSession(requests.Session):
    def __init__(self, timeout=None):
        self.timeout = timeout

    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault('timeout', self.timeout)
        return super(TimeoutSession, self).request(*args, **kwargs)
This allows the timeout to be overridden on individual requests, but uses the session timeout if its not specified.
