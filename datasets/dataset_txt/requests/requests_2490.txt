This is the XML response i get https://gist.github.com/2624993
When i try to parse it with cElementTree, first i get ascii codec error, then if i encode response.text.encode(response.encoding) i get tag mismatched error (62 col 2).
With urllib2 it seem to work ok.
I'm lost as to what can cause this issue, i would be glad to provide more info
