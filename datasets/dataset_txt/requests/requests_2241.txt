Expected: OAuth params in the body and corresponding non-zero Content-Length header.
Actual: No body in the request and Content-Length: 0.
Notes:
As of 8f86ff6 (2012-11-28) the Content-Length was computed after applying auth. In 3491761 (2013-01-11), prepare_body computes Content-Length before prepare_auth computes the OAuth parameters.
requests/requests-oauthlib@ba2ea59 assigns the body data to a data attribute, but 8f86ff6 expects it in a body attribute.
