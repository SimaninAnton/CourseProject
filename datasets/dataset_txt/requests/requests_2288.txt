I recently upgraded from Requests 0.11.1 to 0.14.2. I get a few scripts that rely on the library to download media files (couple of megabytes each). Before, this approach worked just fine:
import requests

r = requests.get('http://docs.python-requests.org/')

while True:
   print 'reading...'
   chunk = r.raw.read(64 * 1024)
   print 'got a chunk of %d bytes' % len(chunk)
   if len(chunk) == 0:
      break
Now, the first read() returns zero byte. Am I doing something wrong?
