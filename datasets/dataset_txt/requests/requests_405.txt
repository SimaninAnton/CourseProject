about the environment
windows 10 Home Edition
python 2.7+ 64
requests 2.16.0 (I run the code in a virtualenv env)
the place : china. I use shadowsocks , and I can google search by Chrome
python code
import requests

response = requests.get(
    url='https://www.google.com.hk/')
print response
process
I try to use googlemaps , a python library, which may rely requests?
And I over the wall by shadowsocks. I can view google and search by google with chrome. And I can direct get api json data by view 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=Vancouver+BC|Seattle&destinations=San+Francisco|Victoria+BC&key=[my_project_key]' with chrome .
But when I use requests library such as requests.get(), It shows the error above(ps: when I use googlemaps, error also come out, almost the same), I tried to find some solution from github, and I change the version of requests to 2.16.0, but error not go away. Also I see some setting should be in code,such as timeout? But it seems no use for me this time.
En, the time, between I run the code and the error finally print out, about 20s.
Also , my classmate, had no get the error, we do almost the same steps, but he tells me,he can print the response correctly.
question
First I want to know , how does this error come?
It comes from my setting or the internet outside?
Second, I want to solve the error, what may I do to keep error away?
This is I expect.
