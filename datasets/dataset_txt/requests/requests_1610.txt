Is there a way to process trailers using Requests?
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2
Adding a trailer, (e.g. Content-MD5) is
especially useful to detect incomplete
streamed reponses from an apache server,
otherwise its difficult (impossible?) to write
a robust client for large server responses.
