I am using python requests module to send GCM(Google Cloud Messages) messages. I am sending millions of messages in a day. But sometimes this weird error pops up
The GCM url is https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send
[Errno 185090050] _ssl.c:340: error:0B084002:x509 certificate routines:X509_load_cert_crl_file:system lib
This generally happens when i am sending a lot of messages.
Have a look at this post too http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699736/ssl-certificate-error-with-python-requests-module-while-sending-gcm-messages
