I would like to use Requests with Flask to make a proxy. I must deal with some large zipped responses (and I do not care about the content).
Please add decode_content as a parameter to requests() so I can return the bytes directly back to the original caller. Specifically, I want to use this with stream=True and pass the iter_content() generator back to Flask for delivery to the original caller.
Thanks
