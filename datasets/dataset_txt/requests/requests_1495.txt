Hi guys, could you confirm if this is a bug or works as intended?
import requests
import json

url = "http://server:8080/jsonrpc?request=";
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'};
payload = {blah};

r = requests.get(url, params=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers);

print(r.url);
It outputs the encoded string BUT for no reason adds an ampersand as below:
http://server:8080/jsonrpc?request=**&**{blah}
This provokes parse errors when querying XBMC/KODI server.
Thanks!
