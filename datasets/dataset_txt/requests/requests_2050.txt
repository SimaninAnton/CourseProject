The test script allows to define HTTPBIN_URL in the environment to specify a locally running instance of httpbin to be used for testing.
However there is one test case (test_mixed_case_scheme_acceptable) where the url is hard-coded to httpbin.org, and two test cases (test_uppercase_scheme and test_uppercase_scheme_redirect) where the url is hard-coded to example.com.
This prevents testing of the Requests modules while behind a proxy that blocks outgoing requests (in my case specifically the https requests) or on a system without external internet connectivity (such as an internal CI system).
