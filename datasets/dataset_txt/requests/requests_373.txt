Summary.
Expected Result
If requests cannot determine what scheme a URL has it should report this clearly.
Actual Result
InvalidSchema at /scrapyd/start-job/
No connection adapters were found for 'localhost:6800/schedule.json'
There is no such thing as a URL "schema".

The words "schema" and "scheme" are distinct. "Schema" is the singular of "schemata". The plural of "scheme" is "schemes" or "schemas". (https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9232/plural-of-scheme) Given that SQL uses the word schema this is an extremely confusing error message.
