I'm trying to make a HTTPAdapter which injects source_address - and after doing my own found #2008 (comment) which it is virtually identical to.
However this fails when proxy configuration is in use as self.poolmanager is not used. I suspect overriding get_connection is required to accomplish this now; it would be nice if https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/59c8d81/requests/adapters.py#L210-L215 could become another method similar to init_poolmanager, so proxy-based connections could be more easily 'adapted'.
Happy to attempt a PR if this idea has merit / is considered 'in-scope' :-)
