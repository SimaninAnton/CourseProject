We are using future module in our project (http://python-future.org/), and it appears that requests has trouble processing futurized strings in Python 2.7.12.
Test case:
from future.types import newstr as str
from requests import get
get("http://google.com/search", params={"q": str("/foo/bar")})
This throws an exception "KeyError: 47".
