Hi there,
consider this minimal test:
from requests import exceptions, Session

url="http://ansgar-skoda.tumblr.com/post/96703389502"

try:
    s = Session()
    r = s.get(url)
except exceptions.TooManyRedirects as t:
    print('ERROR: {}'.format(t))
    r = s.get(url, allow_redirects=False)

print('========')
print(r.status_code)
print(r.headers)
Calling the link in a browser or via curl -L will follow the redirects and return a HTTP 200 after the redirection. That's what I expect.
The code above acts according to expectation when executed with Python2 but not with Python3.
With Python3 you'll get stuck in a redirection loop that gets broken by the TooManyRedirection exception.
In both cases I installed requests 2.13.0 via pip.
I originally posted that on Stackoverflow.
