I have encountered a situation similar to #927.
I am creating a new request with an explicit Authorization header, e.g.
posted = post('…', headers={'Authorization': '…'}, data=…)
Requests is finding and using an entry from a .netrc file I didn’t know existed; it appears to have been generated by the Heroku toolbelt. This overrides the Authorization header supplied in the headers dictionary.
Can the default behavior instead allow environmental factors to be overridden?
Also, can requests make this behavior in some way easier to discover? I am unable to find a way to retrieve the request headers actually sent; they would have provided a valuable clue about the mystery username & password.
