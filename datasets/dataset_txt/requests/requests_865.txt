shows
r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', json={"key": "value"})
but trying the same thing with put did not seem to work.
had to
#r = session.put(url, json=schema) (should work!)
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
r = session.put(url,data=json.dumps(jsonschema),headers=headers)
