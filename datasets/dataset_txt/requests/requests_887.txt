I am using requests (2.10.0) in Python 2.7.11 and I just ran across some very strange behavior with respect to this header. I would like to send along different formats than 'Tue, 08 Nov 2016 05:00:00 GMT' which seems to be passed along just fine, but if I try a string like '2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00' something is munging that value, fails to parse it (but does not raise an error) and my services on the other side get a completely different date (Thu, 31 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT).
So something is going on here, I'm just not sure where or even why. I am wondering if there is a way to simply pass along the string as-is...
