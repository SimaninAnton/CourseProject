I am building a basic load generator and started running into file descriptor limits, I havent seen any documentation pertaining to how to release resources, so either I am doing it wrong and the docs need updated, or requests is leaking file descriptors somewhere (without support for keepalive I am slightly confused at why any files would be left open at all)
