Recently, I tried to crawl some data from www.soccerway.com using 'requests' + 'beautifulsoup'.
Crawling went very smoothly until I found out that all of the time has been offset by 7 hours. (see below comparison)
So I was thinking maybe 'requests' didn't have the right time zone settings. Because the website said that match time will be converted to visitor's local time.
Any idea on how I can change the time-zone settings in 'requests' would be much appreciated.
