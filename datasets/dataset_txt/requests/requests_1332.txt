Using requests 2.7.0 via TwitterAPI, I successfully proxy requests by setting https_proxy in my environment. If either no_proxy or NO_PROXY is set to , or foo.com,,bar.com or foo.com,, I get:
WARNING:root:<class 'requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout'> HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.twitter.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /1.1/statuses/update.json (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f031cdf7908>, 'Connection to api.twitter.com timed out.

which I believe indicates it was no longer trying to use the proxy.
So I theorize an empty no_proxy environment variable segment defaults to *.
