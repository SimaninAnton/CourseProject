Hi,
I've written a program which works perfectly well to seek inforamtions on a website. But when too many people are on this site, a queue is set in order to avoid crashes of the server.
The issue is that the script stays in the queue forever. I mean, on a browser we the queue is there you join it automaticly and after a few minutes, you're on the website (even you reload the page, you keep your place in the queue). However, if we launch the site in a private navigation tab, it starts from afresh.
So, I assume that is a question of Session or Cookies (it's not related to the IP).
Does anyone have an idea of how to solve this issue ? I think it should be by using some Session/cookies function but I don't know how to do that.
Thanks,
Djokx.
