Juste after upgrading my laptop to jessie, I discovered a problem with python requests on py2. For the record, I've created a Debian bug report https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=772506
But to summerize the problem (in a fresh jessie docker container):
In a fresh virtualenv (on a jessie box):

Notice the last time measurement (almost 800ms), which is very painfull since I use requests in cmdline utilities and mercurial extensions...
