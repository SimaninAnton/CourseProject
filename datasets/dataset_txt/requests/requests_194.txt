Please see question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52352118/local-variable-responsedata-referenced-before-assignment-using-requests-libra
            responsedata = requests.get(url, data=data, headers=self.hed, verify=False, timeout=120)
            responsedata.raise_for_status()
The library does not explain in which exceptions we can use the values from raise_for_status() as some exceptions are raised by the get before executing the raise_for_status()
The result is exceptions of referencing variable before assignment.
What I wanted is:
        except (Exceptions that **can not use**  raise_for_status ) as e:
            print ("Thread {3} page #{0} run #{1} failed. Msg: {2}. Retry.".format(page, n, sys.exc_info()[0], thread_name))
            continue

        except (Exceptions that **can use**  raise_for_status ) as e:
            print ("Thread {5} page #{0} run #{1} failed. Returned status code {2}. Reason: {3}. Msg: {4}. Retry.".format(page, n, responsedata.status_code, responsedata.reason, sys.exc_info()[0], thread_name))
            _handle_exception(e, tries, n, page, thread_name)
            continue
The library does not specify information for this.
