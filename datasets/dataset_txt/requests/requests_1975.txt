I get the following exception when doing a request with timeout=0.
>>> requests.get('http://github.com', timeout=0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py", line 55, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)

    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)

    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)

    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 327, in send
    raise ConnectionError(e)
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='github.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by <class 'socket.error'>: [Errno 115] Operation now in progress)
I don't see any mention of this in the issues. Shouldn't the expected behavior of this be equivalent to timeout=None?
I'm running requests version 1.2.3 and python 2.7.3
