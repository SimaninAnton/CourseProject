Hi,
I just upgraded from 0.8 to 2.0.0 and some of my code stopped working.
I have a cookie that looks like this :
Set-Cookie: clearance=xxxxxx; expires=Tue, 01-Oct-13 01:06:08 GMT; path=/; domain=.my_domain.com
with 0.8, r.cookies is set correctly, with 2.0.0 r.cookies is empty.
Interesting fact, if I remove the domain= and the cookie looks like this, it works
Set-Cookie: clearance=xxxxxx; expires=Tue, 01-Oct-13 01:06:08 GMT; path=/
I also tested with 1.2.3 and it seems to have the same behavior.
