Summary.
Requests lib has implemented headers as a dictionary, yet the web supports a repeating header with the same key. Subversion via WebDAV is tech that uses that. For example, "svn log" sends up:
DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/depth
DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/mergeinfo
DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/log-revprops
Expected Result
All three 'A' headers got sent to the server
Actual Result
Only one did
Reproduction Steps
foo = requests.request(verb, url, headers={"A": "one", "A": "two", "A": "three"})
System Information
All versions of requests
