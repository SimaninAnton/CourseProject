hi ,
first thanks for this awsome lib.
my code is working successfully under 0.4.1.
moving to master or 0.10.2 i noticed the following :
passing a cookiejar object does not work but a dict is nicer anyway and access cookies directly from response is nice.
but some of the requests i m doing with master keep on getting a SPNEGO authentifcation failed.
any idea? would really like to move to the latest requests.
Thanks
