There are occasional cases where we could tell a server that we also support a lesser version of TLS when connecting to them and negotiate to a lower version if necessary.
This might reduce the noise we get on the issue tracker about making requests that result in SSLErrors. A great deal of the discussion around this has already taken place over on #1567
I'm still trying to discern how much work would be necessary to support this but I can not image it being too much.
