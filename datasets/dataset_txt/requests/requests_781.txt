Using Python 3.5, requests 2.13.0
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get('https://online.chasecanada.ca/ChaseCanada_Consumer/Login.do')
>>> print(r)
<Response [200]>
>>> print(r.headers)
{'Date': 'Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:52:14 GMT'}

I'm pretty sure the problem is caused by an invalid HTTP header returned by the server:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:16:34 GMT
My Param: None
[...]
It directly follows the Date response header, which is returned fine, but since no other response headers is returned, I think this broken header is breaking the HTTP response headers parser.
