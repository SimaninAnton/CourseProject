I have code which is practically identical to the quickstart code:
        with open(self.filename, 'wb') as fd:
            for chunk in self.req.iter_content(self.chunk_size):
                fd.write(chunk)
                if self.progressbar:
                    self.in_queue.put(len(chunk))
where the queue is read in another thread by the GUI object and updates the progress bar. The problem that I have noticed is that despite the chunk_size being 1024, this code seems to wait until until the code is done and then puts the entire file size in the queue, defeating the point of providing the user with continuous progress on feedback.
