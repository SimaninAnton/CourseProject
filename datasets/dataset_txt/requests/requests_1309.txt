Does the requests module support post requests to more complex HTML elements where values cannot be accessed just by dictionary lookup? For example, say we have the following HTML code, which is present on most Wikipedia pages to support the text of the article:
<textarea tabindex="1" accesskey="," id="wpTextbox1" cols="80" rows="25" style="" lang="en" dir="ltr" name="wpTextbox1"> (body of the article) </textarea>
Is there a way to access the part that says (body of the article) using the requests API, and post to it? I tried 'wpTextbox1' : '' in the dictionary, but this did not work.
