Hi there!
I am currently on requests version: 2.9.1 I have getting the following error in my code:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./add.py", line 98, in <module>
    'SESSID':term.cookies['SESSID'],
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cookies.py", line 276, in __getitem__
    return self._find_no_duplicates(name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cookies.py", line 331, in _find_no_duplicates
    raise KeyError('name=%r, domain=%r, path=%r' % (name, domain, path))
KeyError: "name='SESSID', domain=None, path=None"
Line 98 in add.py refers to the following:
# Grab the Add/Drop Class page cookies                                
ad_cookie = {                                                         
    'SESSID':term.cookies['SESSID'],                                  
    'IDMSESSID':username                                              
} 
Just to make sure that the particular cookie in that page was not removed or missing, I checked the cURL for when I hit that page, and surely enough, both SESSID and IDMSESSID were in that cURL request.
Wondering what the issue is?
