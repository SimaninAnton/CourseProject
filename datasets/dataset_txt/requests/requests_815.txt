requests version: 2.12.4
python version: 2.7.9
platform: linux(CentOS)
issue occured:
ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select()
detail description : urllib3/urllib3@a49bec5
and this issue have been fixed :
urllib3/urllib3#589
sigmavirus24/urllib3@eb8264f
I wonder why requests don't upgrade urllib3? and how can I upgrade urllib3 for requests?
