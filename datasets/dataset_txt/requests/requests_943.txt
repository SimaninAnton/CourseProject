If the Test test_lowlevel.py is being run by pytest in a Python 2 environment, the Testing fails at line 55 with an assertion error: assert len(fake_proxy.handler_results) == 1 is false because fake_proxy.handler_results is empty. The Problem could be as discussed on IRC, that a broken import is causing this failure, because pysocks for python 2 is not imported correct.
Running the same test file within the Python 3 environment, doesn't fail, the whole requests test suite is passed without an issue.
System: Arch Linux x64
Requests Version for Python 2 and 3: 2.11.1
