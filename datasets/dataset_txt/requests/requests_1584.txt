It seems that currently, if 'verify' is set to the filename of a ca_bundle, a certificate that doesn't match it will be accepted without SSLError if it matches the global bundle. This is counter-intuitive, unclear in the documentation and prevents users from actually overriding the ca_bundle with their own.
Example:
openssl req -nodes -x509 -days 3650 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca-key.pem \
    -out ca-cert.pem \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=New York/O=remram.fr/CN=ca.remram.fr"
python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://google.com/', verify='ca-cert.pem'))"
My version is 2.4.3, on OS X.
