Right now, the max_retries config looks like it just handles bad connections in the connection pool down in urllib3. What would you think about adding some higher level retry logic to Requests? For example, if a request ended up with a 503 it might be nice to have some retry logic built into requests to try to re-submit the same request again. The number of retries would be controlled by a new arg with a default of 0.
