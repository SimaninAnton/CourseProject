A discussion at PyCon in the Requests BoF has suggested two approaches to our glorious async future:
Write a codebase that is async and Python 3-only, and then apply an automated code transformation to turn that into a synchronous codebase that ships on Python 2. This will mean that Requests v3 supports only synchronous code on Python 2, and both sync and async code on Python 3.
Mark Requests v2 as a LTS release that we will support until 2020, and then ship Requests v3 as a Python-3-only release (like Django!)
I don't want to go into too much detail on (1), but I'd like to ask our users what they think about option (2). If it's acceptable to you, leave a 👍, if it's unacceptable leave a 👎, and if you have notes about why it's either please leave them below.
Let the comment period begin!
