Looking for guidance to solve the following problem:
On dev env / MacOSX, the following:
url = "http://insurance-guide.netfirms.com"
response = requests.get(url, timeout=90, verify=False, stream=True)
results in:
ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='insurance-guide.netfirms.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by <class 'socket.gaierror'>: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known)
on prod env / Centos 6, the exact same code never timesout and just stays stuck forever...
both env are python 2.7.5 and requests 1.2.3
what could be the cause of the diff behavior on prod vs dev?
