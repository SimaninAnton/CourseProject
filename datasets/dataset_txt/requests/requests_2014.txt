It would be extremely useful to provide a quick link from inside to the requests homepage to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-requests
homepage: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ - see Useful Links
Currently the homepage contains 3 quick links but none of them is linking to a place where people can ask questions and get answers.
Using the bug tracker for this would be clearly against its purpose :)
