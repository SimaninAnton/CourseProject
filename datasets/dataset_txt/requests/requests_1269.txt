The following code will not send a request:
endpoint = 'some.server.com'
data = {'foo':123}
requests.post(self._endpoint , json=data,
                          verify=False, timeout=(5, 0.00))
I would expect the library to send the request but not wait for the server to respond. This would correspond to a fire and forget type of request particularly useful for logging of non critical information
