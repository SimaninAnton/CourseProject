Follows from #3734.
When we patched to ignore all unrecognised schemes instead of just those that didn't begin http, we stopped handling parameters for those URLs. This may break some more benign uses such as http+unix, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.
While this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.
We should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.
