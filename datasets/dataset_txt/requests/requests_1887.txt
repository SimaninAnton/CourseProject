The following line that made it happen has disappeared from Session.request:
    # Add param cookies to session cookies
    self.cookies = cookiejar_from_dict(cookies, cookiejar=self.cookies, overwrite=False)
If this was on purpose then some documentation of breaking changes such as this one would be nice to have.
