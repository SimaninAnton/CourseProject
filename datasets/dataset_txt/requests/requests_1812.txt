When using the requests framework to connect to the xero accounting service from within Google App Engine (using pyxero), I get an error 'Exceeded 30 redirects.' After upgrading the included version of urllib3 to the latest version (1.7.1) the error did not occur any more, and the connection was successful.
More details here:

Reproducible case here (this has the upgraded urllib3, you will need to revert to reproduce the problem):
