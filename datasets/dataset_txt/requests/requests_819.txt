This is due to the following code in the __init__.py file:
# Attempt to enable urllib3's SNI support, if possible
try:
    from .packages.urllib3.contrib import pyopenssl
    pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
except ImportError:
    pass
After I commented out this code, the time was reduced to 0.05 seconds.
Whether this test is necessary for all users?
You may want to remove the code?
