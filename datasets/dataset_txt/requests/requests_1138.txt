Requests grabs its CA bundle by either using the 'certifi' library, or if it's not installed, looking at the hard-coded filename 'cacert.pem'. The problem is that if you're on a Linux distro (ex: OpenSUSE) that doesn't have 'certifi' installed by default and doesn't have the CA bundle named 'cacert.pem', all you get is an unhelpful error telling you it could not find a suitable SSL CA certificate bundle.
What I'm suggesting is that, if the filename look fails and 'certifi' is not loaded, Requests adds a message in the "could not find a suitable SSL CA certificate bundle" error message that suggests that the user install 'certifi' to resolve the problem. It would save a lot of headache for people who aren't savvy enough to search the source code and figure out what they need to install in the first place.
