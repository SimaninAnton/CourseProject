I do not feel that the documentation for a Python library is the place to make political statements (in this case permissive vs copyleft). Such language serves only to aggravate those with differing viewpoints, and leave a lesser impression on those who are just weary of it all! :)
I would suggest removing the section entirely, and just beginning the "Requests License" section with the "Requests is released under the terms of the ISC license:" line.
