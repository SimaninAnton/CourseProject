Hi,
I described it here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20325571/python-requests-failing-over-integer-in-cookie
But basically this creates an error:
import requests
r = requests.get('http://www.c1000.nl/kies-uw-winkel.aspx')
...   
File "/srv/www/li/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cookies.py", line 270, in set_cookie
if cookie.value.startswith('"') and cookie.value.endswith('"'):
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'startswith'
Is this a known issue? Is there any workaround? (i.e. do not parse cookies?)
