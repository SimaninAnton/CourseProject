I am getting the error when making a request to my web api hosted on another machine on IIS express, this is in order for me to debug my application, however when I run my python code I get the error
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error(97, 'Address family not supported by protocol'))
Here is the traceback:
