Several Exceptions in https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/exceptions.py inherit (indirectly) from IOError, but not from other Python exception. Two I can easily see are ConnectionError (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError) and TimeoutError.
It might make sense to inherit from those too. If you think it doesn't, just close the Issue.
