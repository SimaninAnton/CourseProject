How to run the Flask app on Windows? (I want to test my fork)
Following the Procfile I first tried gunicorn httpbin:app -w 6, but that failed because Gunicorn doesn't run on Windows.
Next I tried python httpbin/core.py but that failed too
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "httpbin\core.py", line 24, in
from . import filters
SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import
Any ideas?
