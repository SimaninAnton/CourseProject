Dear Sir,
I like your 'requests' Python library very much and I'm reading the source code these days. I found a problem that is tricky. The 'LookupDict' class definition is:
`
class LookupDict(dict):

    def __init__(self, name=None):
        self.name = name
        super(LookupDict, self).__init__()
    def __repr__(self):
        return '<lookup \'%s\'>' % (self.name)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        # We allow fall-through here, so values default to None

        return self.__dict__.get(key, None)

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        return self.__dict__.get(key, default)
`
It inherits the 'dict' object but does not use any of the 'dict' methed. It only use the class's _dict_ and it is ok to replace the 'dict' with 'object'.
