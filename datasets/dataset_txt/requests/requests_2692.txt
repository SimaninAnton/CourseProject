This script works well on 0.6.4: https://gist.github.com/1308823
But it raises the following error when I use 0.7.3, :
  File "gistfile1.py", line 15, in 
  opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(response.request.cookiejar))
 AttributeError: 'Request' object has no attribute 'cookiejar'
I guess the API was changed but the documentation wasn't.
