For instance, in previous versions of requests it was possible to pass a repines to open() which would read the resource, such as an image, from the response object.
It seems as though the raw attribute should handle this however when trying to pass the raw attribute of a response to open() an error is raised:
>>> open(requests.get('http://www.iana.org/_img/iana-logo-pageheader.png').raw)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, HTTPResponse found
What is the proper way of handling this kind of functionality? Is there a preferred method for pulling down raw data and parsing it as a file-like object?
