Summary.
I am getting ConnectionResetError(10054) while running a POST against a webservice. I am getting successful output every time when I am using POSTMAN to do it.
Expected Result
Should get HTTP Code:200 and successful output
Actual Result
What happened instead.
urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ("Connection broken: ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)", ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None))
