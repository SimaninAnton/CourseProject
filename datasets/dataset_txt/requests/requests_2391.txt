It would be handy if we could support HTTP transactions where the server required client-side SSL authentication.
An ugly urllib2/httplib implementation is here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5899320
I imagine a sample interaction would look something like this:
response = requests.get(url, client_cert="/path/to/cert", client_key="/path/to/key")
or
response = requests.get(url, pem="/path/to/pem")
