This is a regression from 2.7.0 and 2.9.1. When using a URL with an IPv6 ip in the host part of the url:
http://[2620:10d:c021:11::75]/foo, in 2.7.0 the Host header looks correct as so:
Host: [2620:10d:c021:11::75]
But when using 2.9.1, it gets munged:
Host: [[2620:10d:c021:11::75]]
This causes Django to barf.
