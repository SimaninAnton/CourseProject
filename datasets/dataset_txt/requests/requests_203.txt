Summary.
If allow_redirects = True and if redirect response 301 is returned, then POST, PUT and PATCH requests should save body.
Similar issue 1084 was satisfied for 307 responses.
RFC says the same thing about 307 and 301 responses.
Actual result - body is cleaned on 301 response.
Requests version
requests==2.19.1
