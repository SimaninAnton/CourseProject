When performing SSL certificate validation, requests raises an SSLError when the domain name from the URL and the Subject CN don't match. Many recent SSL client implementations (including major browsers) now respect the subjectAltName extension, and consider a certificate valid if that matches, despite a mismatching CN. Support for this would be greatly appreciated.
