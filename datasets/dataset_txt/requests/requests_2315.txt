The documentation at http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#oauth-authentication explains how to use:
client_key
client_secret
resource_owner_key
resource_owner_secret
But it omits the steps to get a resource_owner_key and resource_owner_secret.
It would be nice to have a self-contained start-to-finish tutorial to make an OAuth 1.0 (RFC 5849) authorized resource request to, say, Twitter's API, and maybe one other using OAuth 2.0.
