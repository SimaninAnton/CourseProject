Summary.
Can not find urllib3 when using latest PyCharm and requests from versions 2.17.1 to 2.17.3
What you expected.
Expected urllib3 to be found on packages.py
What happened instead.
Steps to reproduce
Open (or create) any project in PyCharm
You can use the systems Python or a virtualenv
Install requests 2.17.3 (by using pip on terminal or by going to project interpreter settings)
Try to import urllib3
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
Maybe it has something to do with db076c0?
