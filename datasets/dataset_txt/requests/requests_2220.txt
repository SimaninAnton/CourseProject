Hi,
I use requests more and more to test the behavior of my app that runs on Nginx.
I was also planning into using requests to test the behavior when using incorrect HTTP headers, to assert that Nginx does the right thing.
Unfortunately it's impossible to specify Content-Length: '' (I would expect Content-Length: \r\n), or Content-Length: None (or False) (the header shouldn't be in the request at all)
When using the POST interface.
Maybe there is a non obvious way to do that with requests, which I haven't found in the doc ?
For now I will probably end up using a raw socket connection, but it's too bad it's not possible to use requests for those "expected failure" tests.
