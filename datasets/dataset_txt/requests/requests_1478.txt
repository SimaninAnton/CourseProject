Since upgrading to from requests 2.5.3 to 2.6.0 I now see 'A true SSLContext object is not available' warnings.
The test environment is Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
mkvirtualenv requests260 -i requests==2.6.0
....
(requests260)dave@xxps:~$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2

>>> import requests
>>> resp = requests.get('https://github.com')
/home/dave/.virtualenvs/requests260/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:79: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.

The urllib3 documentation recommends the use of PyOpenSSL for python versions earlier than 2.7.9.
The pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3() call is being made in requests/init.py
Is the requests 2.6.0 SSLContext warning expected behaviour on python versions earlier than 2.7.9 considering that PyOpenSSL is being used ?
