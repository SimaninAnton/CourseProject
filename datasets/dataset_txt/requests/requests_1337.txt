Hey there,
Firstly, I absolutely adore requests, it's the reference library for Python and would like to thank you greatly for creating it.
Today I found the little utility function raise_for_status which I think is very useful, but I think it's a little tedious having to call this for each request if this is the way you prefer to work.
Would you please consider a way to allow for this to be run automatically each time a request is made? I was thinking you could have a kwarg to Session which enables it for all requests, and possibly a kwarg for requests.get and so forth?
Thanks again! ðŸ˜„
