So right now the SSL connections when you use pyOpenSSL, ndg-httspclient, and pyasn1 are more secure than if you just use the stdlib options. However it's hard to actually remember those three things. It would be cool if requests would add an extra to it's setup.py so that people can install requests with betterssl, something like:
setup(
    extras_require={
        "betterssl": ["pyOpenSSL", "ndg-httpsclient", "pyasn1"],
    },
)
Would make it so people can install requests like pip install requests[betterssl] and get all of those dependencies without having to manually track those down. It also means people could depend on requests[betterssl] instead of just requests in their own setup.py's.
Extra name can of course be bikeshed here :)
