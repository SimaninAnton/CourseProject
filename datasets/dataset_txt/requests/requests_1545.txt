Hi !
I have used requests successfully for calling some rest resources.
I have called these resources in our staging environment, and things has worked well.
Now I've tried to call the resources in our test environment, but receives the error SSL3_GET_RECORD:decryption failed or bad record mac.
I recon there is a problem with the ssl connection, and want to try forcing requests to use TLS v1. How can I achieve this? I have tried creating the class ForceTLSV1Adapter which is described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26733462/ssl-and-tls-in-python-requests, but I don't know how to tell requests to use this class. Could you please give me a hint?
Thanks in advance
Tor Erik
