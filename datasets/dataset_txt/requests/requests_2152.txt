The following could be an HTTP specification, but I'm not sure.
I have netcat opened, submitting the following request via httpie[https://github.com/jkbr/httpie]
http POST http://cas/api/v1/users/ X_SPIL_AUTH_TOKEN:test
results as the following
POST /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.0
Host: cas
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.4.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
and submitting the following request
http POST http://cas/api/v1/users/ X-SPIL-AUTH-TOKEN:test
ends up with the following result
POST /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.0
Host: cas
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.4.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
Accept: */*
X-SPIL-AUTH-TOKEN: test
