Hi,
requests is used in the connection object of pyArango:
https://github.com/tariqdaouda/pyArango/blob/master/pyArango/connection.py
Though I only see one instance of the connection object being created and used through out the life of https://github.com/tariqdaouda/pyArango/blob/master/examples/debiangraph.py (I've added printfs in these cases) the http connection isn't re-used.
I've followed the connection between pyArango and ArangoDB with Wireshark, to find both of them sending connection: Keep-Alive thus the client instantly disconnecting the tcp connection after the HTTP-Requests is done.
I'm a bit out of Ideas howto better debug this, is there a smart way?
