Do you really like this?
class Response(...):
    def __bool__(self):
        """Returns true if :attr:`status_code` is 'OK'."""
        return self.ok

    def __nonzero__(self):
        """Returns true if :attr:`status_code` is 'OK'."""
        return self.ok
I had this code:
def foo(request, response=None):
    ....
    if response:
        do_something_with_response
It took some time to understand why this did not work like the way I wanted.
I guess you don't want to change the current behaviour since it could break a lot of existing code.
