Hi there,
How am I supposed to handle an incompleteRead?
I don't get it, because TCP is supposed to inherently prevent this right? And getting this error means that Requests, or Urllib3, somehow doesn't do checksumming properly?
I'm just way in over my head thinking about how I'm supposed to even catch it.
