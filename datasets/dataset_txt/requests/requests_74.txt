Hi, I'm trying to launch my python daemon inside of docker container and getting error:
'Connection broken: IncompleteRead(0 bytes read)'
it happens when get requests performed inside of daemon (async, loading about 20k data, totally ~40k get-requests)
As I googled I've find out that users advise to set "stream" value to false - I did it, but nothing changed and then I just went deep into your code and find out that actually this variable does nothing (below is the final destination where this variable is being used):
    def add_headers(self, request, **kwargs):
        """Add any headers needed by the connection. As of v2.0 this does
        nothing by default, but is left for overriding by users that subclass
        the :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` to add headers to.
        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments from the call to send().
        """
        pass
So, could you provide me some info / help - how should I use requests lib to force it to download data on get requests immediately?
