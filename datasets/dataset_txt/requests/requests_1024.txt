I'm not sure if this is the right place to discuss licensing issues. If not please point me to the right place.
Requests itself is under an Apache license, while bundled chardet library is under LGPL. I believe those two are incompatible and people that include requests are expecting it to be 100% Apache, while they get a portion of it under LGPL.
Any thoughts on how this could be resolved?
