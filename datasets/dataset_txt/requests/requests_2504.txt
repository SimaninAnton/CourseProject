In our logs, I noticed this error when using requests to perform a POST to Facebook's Graph API using HTTPS:
File "/home/api/api/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 85, in post
    return request('post', url, data=data, **kwargs)
  File "/home/api/api/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 40, in request
    return s.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
  File "/home/api/api/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 208, in request
    r.send(prefetch=prefetch)
  File "/home/api/api/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 584, in send
    raise SSLError(e)
SSLError: [Errno 185090050] _ssl.c:340: error:0B084002:x509 certificate routines:X509_load_cert_crl_file:system lib
This is the first time I've seen it... could it be at all related to the cacerts file included in one of the dependencies of requests?
Is it related to this at all? #30
