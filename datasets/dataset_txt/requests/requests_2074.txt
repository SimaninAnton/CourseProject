I'm setting up regression testing on an application , which has me doing a lot cookie manipulation : pulling cookies out of a session, retrying a request, putting them back in, etc.
the current cookiejar has great behaviors which I wouldn't change â€“ i'd just want to extend them a bit...
right now the cookiejar builds a new cookie via kwargs, and returns the values. that loses a lot data that is really useful on testing. i can still do what i need to do, it's just more code.
i'd like to propose these 2 additions :
cookiejar.cookie_add - adds a Cookie object
cookiejar.cookie_get - gets a Cookie object
