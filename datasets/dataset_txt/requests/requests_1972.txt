Problem:
A host which requires authentication redirects off-hostname. Using allow_redirects=True will then send the target the current authentication headers. This is almost certainly wrong behaviour.
Probably a solution:
Simple: Just reset the authentication when encountering an off-hostname redirect.
Complex: Introduce a dict of authentication objects keyed on hostname. May break or introduce new API functionality though.
