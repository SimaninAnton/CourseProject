I'm tried to use requests to PUT a big file to a WebDev server
that server that support only support chunked Transfer-Encoding
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)
I know it's kind of a broken server, that it can't stream those files, with out this mechnizem.
it would be nice if it can be implemented on requests
