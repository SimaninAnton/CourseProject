This code in adapters.py
if cert:
   if len(cert) == 2:
       conn.cert_file = cert[0]
       conn.key_file = cert[1]
    else:
        conn.cert_file = cert
Would fail erroneously if a the cert file name were two characters long.
Safer would be to test if cert is a string
such as
if cert:
  if hasattr(cert, 'strip'):
     conn.cert_file = cert
  else:
     conn.cert_file = cert[0]
     conn.key_file = cert[1]
