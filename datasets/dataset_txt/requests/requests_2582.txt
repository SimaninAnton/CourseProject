It would be of great help to boto and others dealing with large files if requests.request's data kwarg accepted file-like objects, in addition to bytes and dicts. In the case of boto and S3, the max file upload size is 5GB. Many VMs and lesser machines don't have that much RAM, so this quickly grinds them to a halt. Being able to gradually read and upload would alleviate this issue.
