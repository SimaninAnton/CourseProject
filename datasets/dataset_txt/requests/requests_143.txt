I'm trying to post to a server using the following script:
import requests                                                                                    
                                                                                                              
data = {                                                                                                      
  'query': 'GetProcess',
  'getFrom': '2018-12-06 10:10:10.000',                                                                     
}                                                                                                                                                                                               
response = requests.post('http://localhost/monitor', data=data)                                           
I cannot find where exactly, but the space character in the getFrom element is being replaced with a +: '2018-12-06+10:10:10.000'
This doesn't match the syntax SQL expects on our server, so the query fails.
I read here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/12528097) that setting the Content-type might help. I tried text/html, text/plain, application/json, and nothing seems to change.
Interestingly, the following (equivalent?) bash command succeeds:
curl -d 'query=GetProcess&getFrom=2018-12-06 10:10:10.000' localhost/monitor
I'm looking for a way to make my server receive "getFrom" : "2018-12-06 10:10:10.000" in the header. Thank you in advance :)
