Currently after pip install git+git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests, pip freeze shows requests==<THE_NEWEST_RELEASED_VERSION> which is misleading as this is true only until the first commit after release :) For this reason I think __version__ should be dev in all untagged changesets. This is what urllib3 does for example. Or even better yet version could be <THE_NEWEST_RELEASED_VERSION>.post1 or <THE_NEXT_PLANNED_VERSION>.dev1 or similar.
