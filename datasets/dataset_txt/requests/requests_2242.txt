preamble:
First, and I hope you're not tired of hearing this, but Requests is awesome! I cannot tell you how much I appreciate Requests after wrangling with urllib and urllib2 just to do basic authentication. Second congratulations on graduating to version 1.0! That's fantastic. Before long this will be included in the Python basic distribution!
expected but observed:
I am new to OAuth 1.0, but the issue I'm having is that I'm passing several header params, but some of them are being ignored. For example if I pass 3 parameters along with the oauth1 params: "output": "json", "term":"star wars", "max_results": "10", but the max_results is always ignored, so is start_index if I include it, otherwise everything else works perfectly.
additional info:
Maybe it's related to this issue: #684
Specifics:
Requests 0.12.1 (or Requests 0.14.2) I tried both
python 2.7.3
ubuntu 12.10

I know there are a couple of python packages out there that do this ...

https://github.com/michaelhelmick/python-netflix

... but I was wondering why this didn't work out of the box. I'm sure it's some n00bie mistake I'm making, but I've searched for a few days, and I can't figure it out. Sorry if it turns out to be something stupid on my part.
