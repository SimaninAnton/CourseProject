Neither http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects or http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#request-sessions talks about Session.request - which I only found once I cloned the source locally.
Originally I was using session.send(preparedRequest) which wasn't persisting cookies or headers. I thought this was a bug / weird issue so I cloned the source and that's when I saw Session.request.
It would be good to clarify the intent of .request versus .send in regards to cookie persistence, headers, etc. etc.
Happy to put together a pull request to update the docs.
