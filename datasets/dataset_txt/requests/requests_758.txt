The documentation for 'requests.request' lists a parameter 'data':
data -- (optional) Dictionary, bytes, or file-like object to send in the body of the Request.
It is unclear what the behavior will be when a dictionary is passed. Since an HTTP request's body is a series of bytes, it is unclear how the library will serialize a dictionary to a series of bytes. For example, will it write the dictionary as JSON, or as XML?
For the other parameter types (bytes or file-like object) I think it is fairly obvious what the behavior will be.
Suggested resolution: the documentation should add a sentence like: "Dictionary objects will be serialized as JSON using the 'json' module", along with any restrictions on the content of the dictionary.
I encountered this when reading the first section of the Quickstart guide.
