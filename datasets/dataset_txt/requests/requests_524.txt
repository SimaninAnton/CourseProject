Hello, Im trying to make multiple Sessions at once, I need to login multiple users into my webpage, but when instantiating requests.Session() it seems like the session is shared, and if I call requests.Session() again there I have the same cookies and the same headers that I stored in the previus object.
Sorry for my english, Im Spanish
Thank you!
