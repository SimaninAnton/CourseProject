Hi!
I like Requests very much, but Python 3 is too much awesomeness to miss. Yeah, I know, you're working on python 3 support but I live in Russia and "I'm working on it" actually means "fuck you, I don't care about your needs" for me :-)
So a few hours ago I drank some vodka and decided to rewrite Requests with Python 3 support by myself. I got a bit carried away in the process, though, so the result does not look like Requests very much, but it still has almost the same API. (Some things like Request.cookies and Response.cookies are missing, but I'll fix it. Maybe.)
Here it is: pyos/requests3. Could you take a look at it, please? I'd really appreciate some thoughts on my code. ^^
(Not sure if creating an issue is a right thing to do to tell someone about that thing; I'm sorry if I made something wrong :-)
