This was originally brought up at #2061. If you change session.proxies after calling session.get and call session.get again, it does not use the updated value. You have to do session.get(proxies=session.proxies).
Assumedly this is not difficult to fix, since setting the keyword argument does work. I didn't read the code, though.
