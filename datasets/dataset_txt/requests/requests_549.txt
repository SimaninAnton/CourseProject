Please help me. I am trying to automate a post from a form. The multiselect portion is throwing me off. the below doesnt work. quite sure the way i am posting the mutliselect portion ('session_id') is wrong
Expected Result
Expected this to work
payload2 = {'from_date': '2017-08-17', 'fac_id': '10', 
            'par_fac_id': '1', 'book_purpose': '0', 'session_id': ['50']}
p2 = s.post(new_url, data=payload2)
session_id comes from a multiselect form.
Actual Result
The request command was not accepted by the server
