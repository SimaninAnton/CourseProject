I suspect this is a documentation issue, for expected and desired behaviour, rather than an unintended bug...
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects states that
The Session object ... will use urllib3's connection pooling. So if you're making several requests to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase (see HTTP persistent connection).
...
Note, however, that method-level parameters will not be persisted across requests, even if using a session. This example will only send the cookies with the first request, but not the second: ..."
There is a minor conflict between those, in that exceptions to the rule include the verify parameter and likely other connection related parameters (cert, timeout, ...?), which do in fact persist across the requests. This is strongly implied by the opening paragraph, which says that the connection is reused.
Also "several requests to the same host" is not quite correct, I believe, as different protocols will result in different connections, naturally.
