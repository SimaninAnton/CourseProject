Something happened between version 0.7.4 and 0.8 that made requests stop working with two embedded devices that I have. One is an Axis video server and the other is a Digital-Loggers web power switch.
I’m using Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.2, under Windows and Linux.
I am able to connect to both devices using 0.7.4. When 0.8 is used it returns a 404 error when trying to connect to the Axis video server and it returns a very basic/simple web page when connection to the web power switch (it’s not the device’s login page but it does have a cookie from the device. Very strange.)
I spent a lot of time trying different options/settings in 0.8 but to no avail.
I have no trouble connecting to these devices using urllib2, htmllib or even wget and of course web browsers.
I’ve been concentrating on projects with these two devices so I haven’t had time to test either version of requests against other servers.
I’m sorry I can’t give you something more specific. I thought I should at least mention that I’ve run into a problem.
