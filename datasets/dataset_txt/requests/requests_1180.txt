requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno bad handshake] [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE', 'certificate verify failed')]
I do not know why it is coming in requests 2.6.0 while it is not coming in requests==2.2.1. This problem start arising yesterday when I hit it to google api on link https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo. I can't use verify=False as many stackoverflow thread is advising. And I'm pretty sure I have used ssl certificate properly in my web site too.
