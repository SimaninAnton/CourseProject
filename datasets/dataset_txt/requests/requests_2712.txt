I would like to make a request, but I do not want to follow the redirect. Currently this does not seem to be possible. I get a 200 response code despite initiating the request with allow_redirects=False. Here's some example code to show what I'm doing:
response = requests.get('http://www.test.com/redirect', allow_redirects=False)
assert response.status_code == 302
Upon investigating the source, it seems that allow_redirects is ignored for GET and HEAD requests.
I'm using v0.6.1
