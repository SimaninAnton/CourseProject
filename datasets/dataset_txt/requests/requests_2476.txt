The very first example on the Website and in the README.md produces an error because Response has no attribute 'text'. Maybe you meant 'content'?
But there is another mistake in that example â€“ the github API call returns nothing. See http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication.
What could be a better example? If someone makes up a good example I'll fix the documentation.
Great work so far, I really love requests!
