I had a situation (with both requests and urllib2) where a page that had <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> was being returned as a bytestring <type 'str'> but did contain unicode characters (due to a server misconfiguration I assume). So when I tried to use it I got the classic UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 419: ordinal not in range(128)
Is this something that requests could fix? Is this something that requests would want to fix?
