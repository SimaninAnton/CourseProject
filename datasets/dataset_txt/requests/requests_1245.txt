On https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/releases , the "latest release" label is next to v2.5.1, whereas the newest release is v2.8.1, which is hidden under the "Show 8 newer tags" link.
If newer release entries are missing because it's a hassle to transpose the release notes into each, perhaps just linking to the relevant entry on http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/updates/ would be sufficient? (Though it seems the permalinks on that page are just generic, eg #id1 and not #v2-8-1 etc). Or even leaving the notes section blank would be fine.
