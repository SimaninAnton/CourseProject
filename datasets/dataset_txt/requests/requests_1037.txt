I was using an old version of requests (I don't know the exact version). When settings the session.timeout it was affecting the timeout value during a call to session.get(). With recent version of requests, this feature doesn't seams to work.
I'm currently using version 2.10.0
Basically, I'm expecting this:
session = requests.session()
session.timeout = 0.0001
session.get('http://localhost/')
To have the same behavior as:
requests.get('http://localhost/', timeout=0.0001)
