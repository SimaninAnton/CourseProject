It would be nice to have a pre_prepare_request hook.
I'm doing frequent requests to an API which requires a query parameter, and a custom header. I created an HTTP adapter to provide the query parameter and the header (because session won't help me with the query parameter).
I was hoping I could also use a hook to modify the url from /bar/ -> foo.com/bar/ because urls made on this adapter shouldn't require the host since you have to use something crappy like get(get_url('/bar/')) just to prepend the host everywhere in a sensible way.
If I had a pre_prepare hook I could modify the URL here.
