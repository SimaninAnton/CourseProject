I'm using 0.13.2
In models.py, line 491
Allow auth to make its changes.
r = self.auth(self)
In #547
it will deregister the hook, after the first request failed, but in the second request it will register a new hook 'response', which causes infinite loop.
Is this the right way to fix it?
if not anyway:
r = self.auth(self)
