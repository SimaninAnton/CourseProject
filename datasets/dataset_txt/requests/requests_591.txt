Trying to use python requests to http post.
r = requests.post(address, data=payload)
r.url only shows the url, not the payload.
My php page is returning an error, but I can't see the full url passed to it.
How do I inspect the WHOLE url posted to the web server to debug it?
Whereas
r = requests.get(...)
r.url returns the entire url including the payload.
TIA.
