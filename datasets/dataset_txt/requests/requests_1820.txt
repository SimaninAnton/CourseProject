When using this functionality http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-uploads
there does not appear to be a response returned. I get nothing back when I try to assign the output of the function like so
with open('massive-body') as f:
    response = requests.post('http://some.url/streamed', data=f)
print response
How can i get the response back from a request made like this.
I want to use this on some very large file uploads and was hoping to use the response to avoid having to issue get requests after the upload to confirm the file properties changed in order to know if the upload worked.
