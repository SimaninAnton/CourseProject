When I use requests 0.10.1 to get a URL like the following
http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0002862UW
with a special user agent so that amazon redirects to a URL with unicode in it, requests will fail with a TooManyRedirects exception. E.g.
r = requests.get(u'http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0002862UW', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; somebot)'})
