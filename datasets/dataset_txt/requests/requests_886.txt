It seems that I am not the only one that discovered that his python-requests library is in a broken state.
    import requests
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/__init__.py", line 64, in <module>
    from . import utils
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/utils.py", line 29, in <module>
    from .exceptions import InvalidURL, InvalidHeader, FileModeWarning
ImportError: cannot import name InvalidHeader
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393979 and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32986626/python-requests-importerror-cannot-import-name-headerparsingerror which are two unrelated occurences that are fixed by the same workaround:
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall requestsexceptions requests requests-toolbelt
pip freeze
I mention that the forced reinstallation did not change the reported versions but fixed the import error.
requests==2.11.1
requests-toolbelt==0.7.0
requestsexceptions==1.1.3
urllib3==1.15.1
