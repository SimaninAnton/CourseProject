In addition to its documented set of optional arguments (stream=, verify=, cert=, proxies=), Session.send accepts arbitrary keyword arguments, which are passed directly to the adapter's send method. (For instance, HTTPAdapter.send also accepts a timeout argument.) resolve_redirects logically ought to do the same, but it does not: it only accepts stream/verify/cert/proxies. This may, for instance, cause a timeout manually specified in a send call to get applied only to the first request and not to subsequent redirections. If you are not manually walking redirections, you presumably want your send kwargs to get applied to all redirections in the chain; if you are manually walking redirections, you may want to be able to control all of the adapter's supported send kwargs at each step.
