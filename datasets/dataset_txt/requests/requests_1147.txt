Here's a test case that never returns a response. Shouldn't this work?
import requests
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def Welcome():
    return "Testing requests module's ability to call the service in which it's running"

@app.route('/test')
def TestRequest(): 
    resp = requests.get('http://0.0.0.0:5004')
    print('Response from TestRequest: '+resp.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5004, debug=True)
