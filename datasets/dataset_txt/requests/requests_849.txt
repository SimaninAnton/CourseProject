I was surprised to see that requests is not making use of Travis/Appveyor CI. Is there a specific reason for that?
I would be willing to send a PR implementing it, if the only reason is that no one got around to it yet.
I also saw that tox.ini is in the .gitignore file - so is tox used locally by some devs but not part of the project? If so: what are the reasons for not having a tox.ini as part of the project? I would use tox.ini to integrate the project with the CI systems and also add a convenient way to run the tests on different interpreters.
