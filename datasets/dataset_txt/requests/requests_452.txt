I am able to get whole json data but not able to get specific key:values from json data (url). Have someone seen this issue ?
Expected Result
Specific Key:Value Pair i.e ( ID : 123456)
What you expected.
I want to extract key-value from json data
Actual Result
Getting below error
print (data["id"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
KeyError: 'id'
What happened instead.
Reproduction Steps
import urllib, json
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
url = requests.get('http://ac-infinibox10.com/api/rest/pools', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('test', 'test'))
data = url.json()
print(data) ###### this works
print (data['id']) ###### this does not works
