I would like to know the amount of data transferred over the wire for accounting purposes when streaming large compressed files.
Currently, I do:
req = requests.get(url, stream=True)
followed by req.iter_content(). Unfortunately the server doesn't respond with anything telling me the length and looking at the source of requests I can't find a way of knowing the original size. It looks like that information is effectively lost at this point in the code. Any chance we could claw it back?
