@dan-blanchard has taken over maintenance of chardet. We've merged charade into chardet so that chardet will now work on python2 and python3 without needing separate versions. I'd like to get rid of charade since it's been a responsibility that I had neglected and has been more trouble than it has been worth.
We should start using chardet proper again when they have it ready. (In all candor it should already be ready)
