I pretty sure this may fix some of the ssl errors regarding clients trying to connect etc.
I base this primarily on pythons ssl wrap functionality from 2.7 http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/ssl.html#ssl.wrap_socket
and openssl's CLI server test tools
openssl s_client -connect servername:443 -ssl3
openssl s_client -connect servername:443 -ssl2
...
...
Clearly this would be a reverse compat feature, but I'm hoping there are enough devs who crave the lower level ssl control of ssl.wrap_socket with this libs tidy stability.
Mmmmmm bound ssl sockets üëç [http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/ssl.html?highlight=ssl#client-side-operation]
Thanks for reading :)
