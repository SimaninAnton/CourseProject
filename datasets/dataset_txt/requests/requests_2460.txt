I've seen some discussion that charset=UTF-8 isn't sufficient because requests looks at the http headers rather than the body of the request (and I can understand the desire to avoid parsing the html looking for the META tag). However, if a page has a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark, I'd think that would be sufficient indication to treat the body as UTF-8.
