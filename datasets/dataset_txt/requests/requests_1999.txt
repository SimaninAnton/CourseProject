Got a strange case of failing timeout on a particular url, when trying in browser, seems like this page never completes loading...
The expected behavior would be for requests to timeout, however it is not happening:
this times out fine:
requests.get("http://www.iva.net/blog/", timeout=0.1)
but this doesn't:
requests.get("http://www.iva.net/blog/", timeout=1)
I'm on python 2.7.5 and requests 1.2.3
