Used requests (and mechanicalsoup) to .get() a web page that has a form on it. The form tag looks like
<form action="/submit_uri" method="post">
I filled a part of the form, and then .submit()ed the form.
  File mechanicalsoup/browser.py", line 114, in submit
    request = self._prepare_request(form, url, **kwargs)
  File "mechanicalsoup/browser.py", line 109, in _prepare_request
    return self.session.prepare_request(request)
  File "requests/sessions.py", line 394, in prepare_request
    hooks=merge_hooks(request.hooks, self.hooks),
  File "requests/models.py", line 294, in prepare
    self.prepare_url(url, params)
  File "requests/models.py", line 354, in prepare_url
    raise MissingSchema(error)
requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL '/submit_uri': No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http:///submit_uri?
