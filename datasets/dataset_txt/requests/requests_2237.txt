The following worked previously
config = {'pool_maxsize':1000}
session = requests.session(config=config)
Obviously the interface has changed slightly. However there is no way to modify the default mounted http adapter to have a higher connection pool size. This should be possible because a limit of 10 is extremely small if you are using it in a proxy connecting to a single server.
If there is a preferred way to do this I am open to suggestions
