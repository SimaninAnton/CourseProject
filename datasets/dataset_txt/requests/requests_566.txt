I'm using request('POST', url, data=data) to access a 4 layer SLB. I found that some of requests delayed for about 2s.
The tcp packets (dumped using tcpdump) shows that the packets are really received from SLB, but request doesn't returned to the caller. Does anyone have any idea about it?
BTW: my requests lib version is 2.12.4
