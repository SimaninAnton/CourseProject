This code:
requests.post(url, files={"file": open(u"漢字.o8d", "r")})
will return a 200, but the file is never uploaded.
I can upload that file by posting in the browser so this doesn't seem to be a server-side issue. Also, if I change the name of the file to "bob" or something ASCII it works perfectly.
