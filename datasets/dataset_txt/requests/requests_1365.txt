Up through v2.6.0, Response.iter_content()would catch all expected exceptions coming from self.raw.stream(), and wrap them in instances of various subclasses of RequestException.
In v2.6.1, urllib3 was updated to 1.10.3, which has issue urllib3/urllib3#673 that causes self.raw.stream() to raise low-level httplib.HTTPExceptions, particularly httplib.IncompleteRead. Because of this, as of v2.6.1 of requests, Response.iter_content() leaks these low-level of exceptions, instead of catching them and wrapping them in RequestException instances.
Issue urllib3/urllib3#673 has been fixed in master, but hasn't been released yet.
To fix this, requests could catch httplib.HTTPException along with urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError, converting both into ChunkedEncodingError. Or requests can upgrade to the newest version of urllib3 when it is released.
