The method urllib.urlretrieve downloads a file from a URL and saves it to disk.
Copy a network object denoted by a URL to a local file, if necessary. If the URL points to a local file, or a valid cached copy of the object exists, the object is not copied.
urlretrieve() will raise ContentTooShortError when it detects that the amount of data available was less than the expected amount (which is the size reported by a Content-Length header). This can occur, for example, when the download is interrupted.
That's a useful helper method. Is there anything like this in Requests?
