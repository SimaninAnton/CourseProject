My services are running on AWS with some of the applications being external. We would run Nagios check to make sure web applications are still accessible (internally and externally). One challenge I have is to run the check as an external user because our Nagios server is in the VPC so the check is performed over the internal VPC network.
There are many ways to solve my problem, for example recompile libcurl to support resolver option, or run my nagios in another VPC without any knowledge of my external applications, or adopt a proxy server.
However, I found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22609385/python-requests-library-define-specific-dns. As a Python programmer I like to stick with Python if requests could offer this out of the box.
Is anyone interested and willing to accept an option in requests to specify custom DNS resolver?
