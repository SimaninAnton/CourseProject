Let's say the server closes the request without sending any data. It's possible that the server began acting on the request (Twilio did this for several years), however requests will raise this as a ConnectionError.
Deep down this gets raised as a BadStatusLine error which is caught by urllib3 and turned into a ProtocolError which is caught & re-raised as a ConnectionError.
