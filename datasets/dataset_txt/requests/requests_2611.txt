Related is #179, which theoretically fixes this.
If there are a bunch of query parameters all with the same key and differing values, it is impossible to cleanly pass them in using the params kwarg, because whatever object is passed in on that route is dictified.
Real use case: Ganeti's API has a few calls which expect URLs to be in the following format:
https://ganeti.example.org:5800/2/some/tag/modifying/api/modify?tag=spam&tag=eggs&tag=spam&tag=spam&tag=bacon
This is circumventable by prepacking the troublesome parameters onto the URL instead of as kwargs, but it's a bit cumbersome and a better remedy would be preferable.
