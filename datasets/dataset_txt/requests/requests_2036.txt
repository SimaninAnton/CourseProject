Reading through the code in adapters.py, I notice that a Response is created, and then has values assigned to it, like this:
    response = Response()

    # Fallback to None if there's no status_code, for whatever reason.
    response.status_code = getattr(resp, 'status', None)

    # Make headers case-insensitive.
    response.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict(getattr(resp, 'headers', {}))

    # Set encoding.
    response.encoding = get_encoding_from_headers(response.headers)
    response.raw = resp
    response.reason = response.raw.reason
Is there a reason that these values are not passed directly into the Response constructor?
I ask because I'd like to use the Response class for passing around HTTP response data internally (for things that aren't necessarily immediately following a requests.request, and the constructor feels like a logical place to do variable assignment.
