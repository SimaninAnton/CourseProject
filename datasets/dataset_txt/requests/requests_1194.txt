Hi,
The following call leads to 'another-header' appearing in the headers sent to the server:
>>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params={'q': 'query'}, headers={'my-header': 'a\r\nanother-header: b'})
I expected either the line break to be escaped in some way, or an exception to be raised. A new header silently appearing in the request doesn't look right.
Requests version is 2.9.1, installed with pip.
