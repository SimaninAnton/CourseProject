Hello
assume that i define a session
r = requests.Session
and i want to set cookie for it :
r.cookies = my_cookies
I know that I must use cookie jar . and I know taht I must use dictionary format. But I have a problem!
normally cookies are in this format
ukey=*****; __qca=*****; _ga=******;
and they are convertable to doctionary format easily
{'ukey' : '****' , '__qca' : '****' , '__ga' : '*****' }
but how can deal whith gmail's cookie ? they have diffrent format , for example
S=gmail=****; COMPASS=gmail=****;
I tested SimpleCookie , that some one requested in this answer at stackoverflow.com
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32281041/converting-cookie-string-into-python-dict
but I got this error message
File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 510, in head return self.request('HEAD', url, **kwargs) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 475, in request resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 611, in send extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, request, r.raw) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/requests/cookies.py", line 133, in extract_cookies_to_jar jar.extract_cookies(res, req) AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extract_cookies'
Please guid me
