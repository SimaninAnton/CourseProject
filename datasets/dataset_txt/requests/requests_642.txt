Hey so the 2.16.0 release broke all of the vendored things I am assuming. I have issued two PRs to two frameworks I use that rely on the vendored packages in requests.
The changelog was a bit obscure about this
2.16.0
Unvendor ALL the things!
Something like BREAKING CHANGE: Vendor packages have been removed, if you relied on these you will need to modify your code would be nice in a 2.16.1 changelog update maybe?
I realize that it can be said these vendored packages are internal and should not be relied on but at least these packages had a use case for using requests and some of the underlying libs and used the vendor packages to ensure everything worked as expected with requests.
Anyone who was relying on these will have their code break upon upgrade, so perhaps a bigger version bump would have been welcome, but at least this can be a warning to people coming here wondering why stuff broke. My solution was a compat.py that conditionally imported urllib3 (works the same for other vendored packages), see my PRs for that fix.
