When using digest auth and a URL containing a "?" the question mark is removed, it seems, from the url.
For example,
r = requests.get('http://foo.com/bar.json', auth=('digest', 'blah', 'bloh'))
works, but:
r = requests.get('http://foo.com/bar.json?really=yes', auth=('digest', 'blah', 'bloh'))
Fails. Inspecting r.request.headers['uri'] shows:
'http://foo.com/bar.jsonreally=yes'
Of course, this could be just an output but, not the actual url that it's trying to hit. Unfortunately, I only have access to one side of this conversation, so I can't tell you what the library is actually sending/asking for. I'll try and find another server that I can test.
