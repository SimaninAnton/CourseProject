I'm trying to log into Wikipedia using the following code:
import requests
s = requests.Session()
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page'
values = {'wpName' : '.....',
'wpPassword' : '.....'}
s.get(url)
req = s.post(url, values)
print(req.cookies)
print(req.url)
However, it does not work. The req.url is the same as the login page (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page), and the cookie jar is empty. Does the MediaWiki software block the requests module, or am I doing something wrong?
