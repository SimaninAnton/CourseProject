using numeric ipv6 fails, as the host contains [] in name, which makes lower calls using httplib raise exception (talking about max. retries and socket.gaierror).
we need to fix local urllib copy to use self.host.strip('[]') in ConnectionPool.init in connectionpool.py, or rather use urllib3 version newer than this:
urllib3/urllib3@208ba74
i will provide the small patch soon, but updating urllib3 might be better idea
