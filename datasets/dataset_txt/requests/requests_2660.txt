We are a startup developing a programmable email platform and we love using Requests.
However we have encountered a problem recently.
Our API tends to send data in key value pairs where a key could have multiple values.
In order to do so we used multi dictionary and it worked pretty well with Requests 0.7.5.
But with new versions of Requests e.g. 0.8.2 it looks like we won't be able to do that.
The problem is that data structures to store 'params', 'data' and 'files' are explicitly set to be dictionaries.
For 'params' and 'data' we could use a list of values for a key but it won't work for 'files'.
I don't know what the mentioned changes in Requests are based on but
is there a chance that the situation would change regarding multi valued keys?
Any advise regarding the issue?
