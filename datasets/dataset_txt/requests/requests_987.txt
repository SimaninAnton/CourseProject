I'm facing some weird problem.
I'm not able to post ~3GB (more than 2GB) file using requests > 0.7.4 module because of getting following err.
File "/build/toolchain/noarch/requests-2.5.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 83, in post
return request('post', url, data=data, *_kwargs)
File "/build/toolchain/noarch/requests-2.5.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 38, in request
return s.request(method=method, url=url, *_kwargs)
File "/build/toolchain/noarch/requests-2.5.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 200, in request
r.send(prefetch=prefetch)
File "/build/toolchain/noarch/requests-2.5.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 387, in send
fields.update({k: (fn, fp.read())})
OverflowError: requested number of bytes is more than a Python string can hold
But, with requests<=0.7.4 its working fine. No problem of OverflowError.
So, I was wondering why it started throwing OverflowError in latest version of requests module (or from requests > 0.7.4)?
I tested this with python2.6 and python2.7.
PS: I know that instead of posting huge file at once, we can post same file via file chunks. But, I do not want chucks way.
