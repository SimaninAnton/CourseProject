Hi,
I can't connect myself to an Apple server using requests.
I can connect myself to this same server using openssl directly or using socket directly
For instance, I'm doing that in such way with openssl
openssl s_client -CAfile GeoTrust_Global_CA.pem -connect api.push.apple.com:443
My code is pretty basic:
s = requests.session() s.cert = "GeoTrust_Global_CA.pem" s.port = 443 url = 'https://api.push.apple.com' r = s.get(url)
