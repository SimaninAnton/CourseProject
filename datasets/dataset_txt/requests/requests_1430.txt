In v2.6.1 we pulled in a new copy of urllib3. Typically this doesn't negatively affect us but in this case we've seen a bunch of new issues from the chunked encoding refactor in urllib3. Because that kind of stuff should not break in a .x release I'm proposing we follow this process when preparing releases (and that we document it for the future):
For an v*.*.x release, e.g., v2.6.1, v2.6.2, v2.6.3, etc. we only include changes to requests itself. This means anything that does not live in requests/packages/{urllib3,chardet}/*.
For a v*.x.0 release, e.g., v2.6.0, v2.7.0, etc. we include changes to requests and update the vendored libraries. The same goes for a vx.0.0 release, but of course those have other implications as well.
