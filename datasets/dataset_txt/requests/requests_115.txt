Hai ! In your api.py file, the function get declare the para params, and assign a default value to it, then we can use the get func like requests.get(url, {"k1":"v1", "k2":"v2"}) without pointing out the key params of the second para. But in your sessions.py file, the method get of the class Session didn't declare the para params, so we must use the Session.get method like s.get(url, params={"k1":"v1", "k2":"v2"}), or it will raise a TypeError TypeError: get() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given. I checked all request methods defined under the class Session and all requests API in the api.py file, and found that only the get method has this little difference. It used to bother me. Could you please eliminate this little difference? :) Good Luck !
