hi there.
i try to upload a file via this:
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#post-multiple-multipart-encoded-files
but it does seem to read it into ram first. because i get memory errors on my low ram vps.
it would be good if it would have worked like this:
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-uploads
my example code:
import requests
with open('example.rar', 'rb') as f:
r = requests.post('https://anonfiles.com/api/v1/upload', files={'file' : f})
print r.text
