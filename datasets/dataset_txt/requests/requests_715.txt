Running tests on my project with the -Wd option now displays lots of DeprecationWarnings coming from requests.
From the Python 3.6 Changelog (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#deprecated-python-behavior):
A backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence now generates a DeprecationWarning. Although this will eventually become a SyntaxError, that will not be for several Python releases. (Contributed by Emanuel Barry in bpo-27364.)
For reference, this is the commit that fixed those DeprecationWarnings in Django 1.11: django/django@8119b67
