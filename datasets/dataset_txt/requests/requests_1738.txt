I am getting the above error thrown when I attempt to get the request text when the content is a dict-string (ie. '{}'). I've found that it is this line, but I am not sure how to fix it at this point:

If you were to remove the errors keyword, it works fine. I believe it's because the content is not returning as bytes, as str expects.
https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#str
Not sure how to fix this yet.
Note: if you want to replicate this, use Python 3 and set content to '{}' and try to return text
