When server responds with Transfer-Encoding: chunked, it would be nice if requests would process the chunked response. Right now if I do response.iter_lines() I get access to chunks part where length of the chunk is encoded with optional chunk extension. It would be awesome if requests would provide something like iter_chunks where I would get access to the chunk data only.
