I'm making requests against an API which takes comma separated parameter values.
A working request looks like this:
curl http://localhost:4444/endpoint?val=555,666
When I pass these parameters in with requests.get() however, the resulting URL looks like this:
>>> r = requests.get('http://localhost:4444/endpoint/', params={'val': '555,666'})
>>> r.url
u'http://localhost:4444/endpoint/?val=555%2C666'
I can build the URL myself, but I'm wondering if this is the intended behavior?
