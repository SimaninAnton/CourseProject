To be honest I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I am unable to find a solution so here goes.
This is running on my laptop connected over wifi - no proxies.I'm on Fedora 23, running requests 2.10.0 in a Python 3.4.3 virtual env.
I have an infinite loop running requests.get's on a http url (say 'http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html') and sleeping.
If I start the program with wifi ON, it works well. The gets succeed. If I turn OFF wifi on my laptop (program still running), the gets start throwing exceptions which I catch and handle. Then when I turn wifi ON again (program still running), the gets start working again.
But if I turn wifi OFF and then start the program, it doesn't work. The gets throw exceptions which I catch and handle. But then if I turn ON the wifi (program still running) the gets continue to throw exceptions. At this point I can access the url from my browser but the requests.get()s continue to fail throwing
RequestException: HTTPConnectionPool(host='info.cern.ch', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fe105b12cf8>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname',))
Best I can make out is that the HTTPConnectionPool created at startup - with wifi OFF - somehow sticks around (probably tied to the eth interface?) and continues to fail even though wifi is now working.
I have tried creating a Session in the while loop and explicitly close() ing it at the end. I've tried creating a Session outside the while loop and close() and re-creating it inside the get() exception handling. I've even tried import requests inside the while loop (yes I know that's a bad idea) but even that fails.
I can reproduce this behaviour from the Python REPL environment as follows:
Turn OFF wifi
Start REPL, import requests and get()
