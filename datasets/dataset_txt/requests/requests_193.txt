Hi everybody.
Yes I read it #4216
It ends with @Lukasa quoting specification.
But if we read this specification a bit further:
A user agent that receives an obs-fold in a response message that is
not within a message/http container MUST replace each received
obs-fold with one or more SP octets prior to interpreting the field
value.
So it MUST be supported, no?
