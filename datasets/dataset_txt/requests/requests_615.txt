According to the documentation:
netrc Authentication
If no authentication method is given with the auth argument, Requests will attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL's hostname from the user's netrc file. The netrc file overrides raw HTTP authentication headers set with headers=.
If credentials for the hostname are found, the request is sent with HTTP Basic Auth.
How can i use then Digest with ~/.netrc ?
