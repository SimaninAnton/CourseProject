A common standard supported by many command-line tools is to use environment variables to configure proxies. The variables are described in full here:
http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html
According to the documentation, urllib and urllib2 support this.
Note that the environment variable names for these settings are considered to be case-insensitive, so http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY should work.
I'm happy to have a go at implementing this, if you can point me to the correct place in the code where you think it should be handled. Also, is there a guide anywhere detailing how to run the test suite?
Cheers
