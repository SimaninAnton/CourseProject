I'm afraid this is a bit of a 'WTF' thing. I was trying to use a hosted package repository, and discovered that trying to upload a wheel for requests failed. Some back and forth revealed an interesting reason: they store package description in MySQL, and MySQL can't normally store 4-byte UTF-8 sequences. And it so happens the cake symbol you are using for the pip install example is a 4-byte UTF-8 character.
Considering this is not a bug in requests and the limitation is completely silly I hate to ask this, but still: could you consider using another replacing that cake symbol with something else so we won't hit that limitation?
