Hello,
Jakub Wilk reported this on the Debian Bug Tracker[ยน]:
If site A redirects to site B, and user had a password for site A in 
their ~/.netrc, then requests would send authorization information both 
to site A and to site B.
Jakub wrote also some tests to show the issue, you can find them attached on the Debian Bug Tracker.
I have already updated requests Debian package (it's ready for the upload) and I can confirm that the issue is present also in requests 2.2.1.
Cheers!
