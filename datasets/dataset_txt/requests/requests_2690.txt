I'd quite like to see Requests have support for proxy chaining. The actual code is pretty straight forward from what I can make of this implementation: https://github.com/pagekite/PySocksipyChain/
The httplib2 module supports both SOCKS and HTTPS proxies via the same terrible library (sockipy, as I recall). It is very frustrating to work with, so I'd recommend clean implementations of SOCKS and HTTPS proxy support.
So if you can, supporting more than a single instance of a single proxy+protocol would be great. thanks,
