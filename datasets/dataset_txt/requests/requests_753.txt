I am using requests to create a get request and wanting to display the whole html content:
import requests
url = 'http://website.net/thelink'
headers = {"User-agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.80 Safari/537.36"}
req = requests.get(url,headers=headers)
However when using print, does not output the html correctly in a section:
print req.content
<div id='error' class='tabdata'>
Please wait while we validate your browser.
</div>
I have seen this div/tag shown already on the browser and eventually the content displays. What I need is to wait on the get request for a little while and then save the content response. Any ideas how to do that ?
