It looks as though matrix parameters that are in a non-leaf segment of the URI path get URI encoded and so corrupted.
E.g.
http://server:port/root;property1=value1/path/name.type
becomes
http://server:port/root%3Bproperty1%3Dvalue1/path/name.type
but if you put them at the end it is OK:
http://server:port/root/path/name.type;property1=value1
