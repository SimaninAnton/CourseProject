I saw a couple of requests that touched on this issue but, none that have hit it on the nose. Has adding a custom line delimiter functionality to iter_lines() been considered before? If so, what are the reasons for not including it? If the feature has not yet been considered, I would not mind submitting a pull request for comment.
This feature would be useful in cases when, for example, newlines are a part of data and the stream is delimited with, say <>.
