Slight grump. When I set a timeout (say requests.get('some url', timeout=1.0)), if the server on the other end doesn't reply in time, I get a urllib2.URLError thrown. Yay that it timed out right, but in order to catch the exception, I have to import urllib2 as well. Any chance there could be a requests exception thrown there instead?
