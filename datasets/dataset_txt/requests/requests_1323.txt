Getting a few users who are having this issue when doing requests: https://github.com/RuudBurger/CouchPotatoServer/issues/5239
The call is being done on this line: https://github.com/RuudBurger/CouchPotatoServer/blob/master/couchpotato/core/plugins/base.py#L250 with verify disabled, so I don't understand why it tries to validate the connection in the first place.
Is this because of an older pyopenssl installation or do I need to do something else?
