As stated in the docs:
timeout is not a time limit on the entire response download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a response for timeout seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been received on the underlying socket for timeout seconds).
With that said, it should still be possible to timeout when stream == True.
The following command times out as expected.
$ python3 -c "import requests; response = requests.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/delay/3', timeout=1); print(response)"
The following command does not timeout. A timeout is expected.
$ python3 -c "import requests; response = requests.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/delay/3', stream=True, timeout=1); print(response)"
