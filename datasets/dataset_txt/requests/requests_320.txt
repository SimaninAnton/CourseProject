Very simply, I would like to have HTTP 419 status code represented as a constant in the requests.codes module, perhaps as requests.codes.AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT.
While this code is not officially (to my knowledge) part of an RFC / standard, it seems to have colloquial use / adoption on many Internet-facing web services.
Here's another framework who is considering this support (granted, the context is a bit different WRT requests):
jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt#158
I'll post a basic PR to illustrate the request; no pressure to merge it as I am unsure what requests' policy on RFCs/standards is (whether or not dogmatic adherence thereto is a tenet/goal of this project).
