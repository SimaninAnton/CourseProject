tested with requests 2.9
when a http server resonds with multiple Location headers in 301 redirect the locations are concatenated
eg
Location: http://foo.com
Location: http://foo.com
results in a redirect to
"http://foo.com,http://foo.com"
pretty sure this behavior is not present in any other http clients
