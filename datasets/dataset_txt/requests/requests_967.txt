Code:
proxies = {'https': u'https://...:8080'} # or {'HTTP':'http://:80' }
r = requests.head(u'http://example.com', proxies=proxies, timeout=10)
r.status_code
>>> 200
The proxy is broken, seems requests do not use this proxy and make request directly,
it should raise ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.' here.
