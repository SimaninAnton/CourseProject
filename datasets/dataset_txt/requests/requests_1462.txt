I'd like to be able to save and load a session to disk. I think this means just saving and loading the cookies, but perhaps there are other nuances that would need to be included.
I'm interested in using Robobrowser (https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser) which wraps requests. I'd like to be able to persist the browser between running my application, which means being able to save and load the session to disk.
There is a SO post regarding how to do this. I think tellingly, the most popular answer is wrong.
