The GET request is not following redirects when setting a header even with allow_redirects set to True. In this example setting a header manually for the user-agent causes the request to not follow redirects. I would expect that even with setting headers it would give the same output as not setting a header.
url = "http://t.co/ms7J7HJ0"
r = requests.get(url)
r.url 
>>> u'http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070501/column-guest.html'

headers = { 'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/535.21 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/19.0.1042.0 Safari/535.21' }
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)
r.url
>>> u'http://t.co/ms7J7HJ0'
