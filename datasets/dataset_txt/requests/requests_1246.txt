We added support for a new form of unbundling logic in #2567. Unfortunately, this seems not to work properly. Specifically, the presence of requests in a system makes it impossible to catch urllib3 exceptions correctly: see this Stack Overflow question for more.
This problem seems to specifically affect the urllib3 sub-packages, not urllib3 itself. One proposed change is to add every urllib3 sub-package that gets imported to the list of modules requests explicitly imports in this stub file. This is pretty gross, but might work. Does anyone have other suggestions?
