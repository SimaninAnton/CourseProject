Right now, requests supports urllib3 retries at the pool level, allowing retries to occur fairly globally. It seems as if urllib3 supports retries at a more granular level as well, for individual requests:
>>> r = http.request(
...     'GET',
...     'http://httpbin.org/redirect/3',
...     retries=urllib3.Retries(
...         redirect=2, raise_on_redirect=False))
>>> r.status
302
It would be nice if requests had support for this level of granularity, as some of our cases require retries for only specific endpoints on a single API.
Apologies if this is the wrong place for this, wasn't sure where to place feature requests.
Thanks!
