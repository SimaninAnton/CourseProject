I can't use io.ByteIO in order to "put" a stream of data
In fact Requests use 'super_len' in "prepare_body" in order to check its length, and "super_len" checks for the "fileno" attribute.
io.ByteIO has that attribute, but it "Returns underlying file descriptor if one exists.An IOError is raised if the IO object does not use a file descriptor."
So I always get a "UnsupportedOperation: fileno" error.
I see that super_len is under a "try:.. exception (TypeError, AttributeError):" ; I propose to add the "io.UnsupportedOperation" exception among the others
