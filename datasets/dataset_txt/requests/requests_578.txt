I have searched the repo for strings "gzip", "zlib" and have not found this packages imported. It seems that (de)compression is done implicitly somewhere. It poses some problems, for example if I want to add support of some compression/decompression algo like brotli.
Expected Result
There should be a dict mapping compression algo name from http headers to (de)compresssion function.
Actual Result
I have not found such one.
