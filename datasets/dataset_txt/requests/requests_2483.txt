Currently, as @djco and @Arfrever note, the Makefile doesn't make it into the Pypi tarball, and a plain invocation of nosetests doesn't run the right tests. So if you've downloaded Requests and you want to run the tests, it's not clear how. This is a reasonable thing to want to do.
Also, we should document which tests contributors should run before they submit their pull requests. (Ideally we would encourage contributors to run make pyflakes.)
