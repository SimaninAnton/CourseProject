Is there a way to send intermittent responses to client to avoid timeout for long-running tasks (~2minutes) ?
If not, I guess I will have to do the following flow:
User requests a webpage
Check if that webpage is available in cache
If not, redirect them to a holding page that checks ~15 seconds if that request is ready
Load the response
Seems less than ideal, but gets the added benefit of showing some sort of progress indicator to the user.
