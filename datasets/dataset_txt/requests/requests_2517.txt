Code like for line in http_response.iter_lines(): works fine with 0.10.8 but when used with 0.11.1, lines are not yielded as expected and when the server closes the connection, the following exception is raised:
httplib.IncompleteRead: IncompleteRead(354 bytes read) (where that 354 bytes is about the size of the lines I should I received ;-))
I did not have time to further investigate but opened this ticket in case you have an idea what recent change may have introduced this issue.
Will try to dig in further when I have some spare time.
