I've seen #4463 but I'm wondering why the system level certs are not used. I know it has "never" done it, but why? Is the problem related to supporting multiple platforms, or is there another reason?
I've just run into a problem where the IT dept was doing a MITM on their workers, and had loaded a cert that Chrome was using. I could export that cert and put it in a linux vm pretty easily and fix CURL, but putting that same cert into the certifi file generated errors about the issuer and serial number.
This might be an question for a different package, if so, just let me know and I'll happily quiz them. I'm torn as to whether this is a urllib3 issue or a requests issue.
