This is the call in question:
r = requests.post(url, auth=creds, data=json.dumps(post_data), 
                  headers={'content-type':'application/json'})
post_data is a dictionary.
post_data['x'] is a string of varying length:
post_data['x'] = '.' * L
(a) For L < 3487 and creds is correct username/password, I receive expected 200 response right away.
(b) For L < 3487 and creds is incorrect username/password, I receive expected 401 response right away.
(c) For L >= 3487 and creds is correct username/password, I receive expected 200 response right away.
(d) For L >= 3487 and creds is incorrect username/password, the call hangs for about a minute and then I receive 401 response, but the data is empty (r.text is empty string). I expect a JSON response which I do receive properly in (b) above.
On the server hosting the url, I see the response go out right away in all cases. Is there anything more I can do to further isolate this and figure out what's going on? I don't know if L=3487 is specific to my system or not; could be higher or lower for others. I am using Python 2.7 and requests 2.3.0.
