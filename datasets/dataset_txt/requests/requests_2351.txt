I'm not sure if this is a requests or requests-oauth issue, so I've opened it both places:
maraujop/requests-oauth#40
basically I'm sending a request that gets a 400 status from requests. However, if I take response.url and request it again, I get the correct response. Odd?
response = self.client.request(method, url, data=request_params, allow_redirects=True)
response.raise_for_status()
>> 400

response = self.client.request(method, url, data=request_params, allow_redirects=True)
response = requests.get(response.url)
response.raise_for_status()
print response
>> correct response json
