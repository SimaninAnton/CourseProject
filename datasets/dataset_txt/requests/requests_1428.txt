now I've got for redirections:
  File "bin/eggs/requests-2.6.2-py2.7.egg/requests/sessions.py", line 573, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "bin/eggs/requests-2.6.2-py2.7.egg/requests/adapters.py", line 415, in send
    raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)
ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', ResponseNotReady())
requests 2.6 works fine.
