99% of the times I use .get() i get responses in ms... but there are certain URLs that I work on, both http and https, they are available globally too(but can't be shared for some reason). What I found is that some of these .get() never actually returns a value instead .get() command never ends, it keeps running infinitely. What could be the reason?Is there any alternate, such as using Proxy or anything as such? Please suggest.
