It doesn't appear that requests currently supports any built-in mechanism for automatically compressing a given HTTP body payload (e.g. JSON). Correct me if I missed something terribly obvious here, and apologies if I did.
I could certainly just implement the compression part myself, but I was wondering if the requests community thinks that a feature like this would be useful in general or is too specific to each integration's problem domain and so should remain there?
If people think this sounds interesting I'd be happy to take a stab at implementing it. Thanks!
