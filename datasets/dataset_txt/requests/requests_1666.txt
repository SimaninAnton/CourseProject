I am using requests to POST data to a server. In testing with a 14.4 MB file, requests took 16.5 seconds and cURL took 3.3 seconds. The following image shows the 3 tests I ran. The first bump is using requests with MultipartEncoder from requests-toolbelt. The second bump is just using requests. The last bump is cURL.
I am using Python 3.4.0, requests 2.3.0, and requests-toolbelt 0.3.1 on Windows 7 x64.
Are there any settings I can tune to speed up requests?
