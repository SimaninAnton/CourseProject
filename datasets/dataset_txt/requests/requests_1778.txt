Some IPv6 addresses contains the '%' sign ( link-local addresses : ex. fe80::21b:63ff:feab:e6a6%eth0 or [fe80::21b:63ff:feab:e6a6%eth0] )
When using this addresses the requests library raises the fallowing exception: "requests.exceptions.InvalidURL: Invalid percent-escape sequence: 'et'"
(raised by the function unquote_unreserved() from the utils.py).
If I put as first line in this function the "return uri" line (in other words if I pass over this function), everything works ok.
