Custom 'Accept' headers are overwritten by the ProxyManager._set_proxy_headers function in urllib3's poolmanager.py (line 124)
I did a bit of googling but couldn't come up with a reason why this should be done; if this modification of the 'Accept' header is not needed, would it be possible to get it removed somehow?
