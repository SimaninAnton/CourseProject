Currently using the following to upload a file to a webserver:
files = {'files': ('.png', open(file_path, 'rb'))}
res = requests.post(url, files=files)
The reason I rename the file to just ".png" is because with an empty base name the server will randomly give the file a name.
However, and I'm not sure if requests is the one to blame here, the file ends up being uploaded with the name "png" instead, as if the leading "." was stripped from the name.
Is this something requests is intentionally doing or should I look elsewhere for the cause?
