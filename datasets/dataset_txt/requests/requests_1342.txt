Opening issue (appears to be related to issue #1856) as this issue is still breaking for me.
When I run the following it breaks:
>>> import requests
>>> url = "http://sitereview.bluecoat.com/rest/categorization"
>>> data = {'url':'google.com'}
>>> proxy = { "http": "http://test.username:testp@ssword#@proxy.url.com:8080"}
>>> header = {'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0'}
>>> request = requests.post(url, proxies=proxy, headers=header, data=data)
The error it is giving is as follows:
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='ssword', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: http://sitereview.bluecoat.com/rest/categorization (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', gaierror(-2, 'Name or service not known')))
If I change the password over to testp@ssword instead of testp@ssword# it works just fine.
It may be that I am rather new but I would appreciate any help or insight you can provide.
