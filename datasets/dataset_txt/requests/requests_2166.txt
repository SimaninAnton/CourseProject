This is the current description of iter_lines:
Iterates over the response data, one line at a time. This avoids reading the content at once into memory for large responses.
The "avoids reading the content at once into memory" part seems to imply that this has streaming behavior, but that's not currently the case without specifying stream=True on the request.
Maybe this is just a reading comprehension fail on my part, but it took longer than I would have liked to get the desired behavior.
