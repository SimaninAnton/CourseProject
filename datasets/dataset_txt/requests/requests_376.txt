Summary.
When sending file in requests with :
f = open("blabla.pdf")
requests.post('http://localhost:9999',data=f)
the Whole file gets read before the request goes out, should not that be that the requests get sent with chunks - meaning a number of POST requests until the file gets ended??
i mean - when the requests library decide to "cut" and send the request?
it is the same in generator which send a lot of data
what is the maximum size of the request that being supported?
Expected Result
several post requests
