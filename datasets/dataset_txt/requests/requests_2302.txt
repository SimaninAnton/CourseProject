Couldn't find anywhere to ask this question so forgive me for opening up an issue.
Is there a way in Requests to get a trace of the over the wire http for a request response.
In httplib2 your could do it by setting httplib2.debuglevel
I hope requests has something better. such as a trace attribute on the response object.
