There's this stack overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/q/10588644/2195033
The question is about something that should be simple: Print the whole http request.
Because often it's much easier to debug something by seeing it exactly as it was sent over the wire (Figuratively. Obviously I'd prefer the unencrypted one in the case of https)
I've visited this page way too many times. Unsurprisingly, it's always the same two answers:
"Copypaste these 20 lines into your project to enable debugging"
"Inspect these 20 attributes one by one, or assemble the whole thing yourself"
In the comments of the second one, someone asks 'Which of these gives me "the entire request, headers included"?'. No replies to that other than the assumption that reassembling the request manually is okay. The first one kinda does the job, but it feels like the times when i copypasted activestate recipes to be able to do multipart file uploads.
Does it really have to be this way? Why not provide built-in helpers for these things?
requests.enable_basic_debugging_globally()
Or:
print(req.raw_request_string_as_it_is_going_to_get_sent_over_the_wire)
print(resp.raw_response_string_with_headers_and_status_line)
print(resp.raw_response_string_with_headers_and_status_line_and_also_the_request_before_it)
Ok, I'm not great at api design. You get the idea.
