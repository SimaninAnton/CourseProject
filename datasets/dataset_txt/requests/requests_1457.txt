Hi!
I noticed that the --help output of a tool of mine was noticably slower than that of my other tools. It took a full second to show up. I traced the lagging down to the call to import requests (and worked around it by importing requests only after processing command line options).
import requests takes at least a second on both the SSDed Debian and HDDed Gentoo, with version 2.5.3 as well as 2.6.0. Compared to the 30 milliseconds that other modules take to import, that's a long time:
# time python -c 'import requests; print requests.__file__'
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/requests/__init__.pyc

real    0m1.099s
user    0m1.055s
sys     0m0.039s

# time python -c 'import argparse; print argparse.__file__'
/usr/lib64/python2.7/argparse.pyc

real    0m0.030s
user    0m0.018s
sys     0m0.010s
It would be great if you could work on reducing import time. Many thanks!
