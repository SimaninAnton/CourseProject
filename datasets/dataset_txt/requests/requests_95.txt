I'm using requests to compile a custom URL and one parameter includes a pound sign. Can anyone explain how to pass the parameter without the pound sign changing to "%23"?
download URL: www.example.com/type=#results
currently returns: www.example.com/type=%23results
FWIW, this process works without using params within requests. I know it's weird having a pound sign in a URL but after multiple tests I've concluded that the only way of downoading the file I need is to include the pound sign.
