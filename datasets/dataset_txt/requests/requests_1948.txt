Hi, can I access earlier socket to make new POST request to same server, because I don't want to waste time to make connection with server so
server.com
GET /index.php
server.com
POST /somewhere/in/www.php
param=value&param=value
I want to be able to make POST as soon as possible, so I don't want to close connection and reuse earlier socket/session
