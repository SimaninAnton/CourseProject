Currently, the only way to have a multipart form request is r = requests.post(url, data=payload, files=files)
which may have a component
--3eeaadbfda0441b8be821bbed2962e4d
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="filename.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

content
--3eeaadbfda0441b8be821bbed2962e4d--
However, I run into instances where posts are required to be in a multipart format without an associated file, like:
--3eeaadbfda0441b8be821bbed2962e4d
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="key1"

value1
--3eeaadbfda0441b8be821bbed2962e4d
but the latter is impossible to generate without the former.
Perhaps we can add a flag like r = requests.post(url, data=payload, multipart=True) that forces a post to be multipart, even without a file.
I am happy to work on implementing this if it sounds like a good idea.
