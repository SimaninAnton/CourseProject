Currently, if data contains None values they are passed on to urllib.urlencode as normal. The behaviour of urllib.urlencode is to always call str() on the key/value.
This results in the following:
urllib.urlencode({'key': None})
# 'key=None'
To me this seems like odd behaviour. If anything it would make sense for it to result in 'key='.
One option would be to do something like v = v or '' before encoding the data.
Alternatively exceptions could be raised if a key or value is None.
Does this sound like something that should be changed?
