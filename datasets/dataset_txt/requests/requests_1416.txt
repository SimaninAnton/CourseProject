This is just a question I'd like to mark as feature request.
Is it ever planned to provide some kind of redundancy - i.e. add a list or URLs to the Request Object and the Request Object would try to fetch the next URL, if the first one timed out.
This might be interesting if requesting web APIs, where redundancy is not provided by the service.
Just tell if this is a bad idea.
