I tried to use the Geocoding API of goole maps to convert the address to coordinates, but it failed which seems to be related to requests when I tried the sample code like:
gmaps=googlemaps.Client(key='MY_KEY')
geocode_result=gmaps.geocode('1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA')
print geocode_result
but I got an exception like
googlemaps.exceptions.TransportError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='maps.googleapis.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway%2C+Mountain+View%2C+CA&key=AIzaSyBYdEWfcUNHUP3zLtc17nX-3aE4uPUkFnY (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x0000000016239278>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 10060] ',))
BTW, I am work on PyCharm with python version 2.7.12 and I am using a VPN, I wonder if it's related to this.
Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.
