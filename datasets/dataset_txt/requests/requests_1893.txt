I was using requests to submit POST requests to a third-party website when I noticed that the files parameter can also accept a three- or four-element tuple that denotes body content-type (and another header?) (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/models.py#L120) instead of just two as noted in the docs.
Is there a reason this is not yet mentioned in the docs or can I expect this interface may break in future releases?
I'm on Requests version 2.0.1, by the way :).
