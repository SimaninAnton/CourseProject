I have an import warning:
site-packages/requests/utils.py:17: ImportWarning: Not importing directory '/home/x/platform'
 missing __init__.py

  import platform
so my directory: platform hided system module platform.py
This can only be fixed by adding
from __future__ import absolute_import at the first line of utils.py
Also it would be nice to have this for every module.
This should do no harm to python 3.
