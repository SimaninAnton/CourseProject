With requests 1.0.4, if one makes a POST or PUT request to a resource which returns a 307 temporary redirect (section 10.3.8 in the RFC), requests will automatically submit the same request to the redirect target, but without any body.
The RFC states:
   If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other
   than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
   request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
   change the conditions under which the request was issued.
Therefore, I believe requests should raise an exception in these cases, or otherwise require that the request be configured to "re-post on 307".
I suspect the author has already considered some of these issues, so I post this bug to raise awareness of the issue and document the intended behavior, or to alter the behavior to better suit expectations.
Please let us know if there's anything we can do to help (demonstrate behavior, write tests, supply patch).
