I notice that despite using requests.Session() - I still seem to be creating new connections/sockets which eventually exhaust (TIME_WAIT) and I get the following error:
[WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted',))
s = requests.Session()
data = zip(url_routes, cycle(s))
calc_routes = pool.map(processRequest, data)
I posted a bit more here, however not sure how to address this
