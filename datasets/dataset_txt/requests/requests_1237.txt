Hi all. I'm having issues with posting files with UTF-8 file names.
I've thoroughly read these 2 issues:
#2505
pallets/flask#1384
Please also refer to my question on SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33717690/python-requests-post-with-unicode-filenames
Unlike the first issue I linked to, my filename doesn't end with '\n'.
I noticed that the file ends up in request.form and not in request.files (just like described in the issues I linked to), must be because of the '' in 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file0"; filename=utf-8''%D7%90.txt' just after 'filename'.
