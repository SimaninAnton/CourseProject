I get this warning when running nosetests against a project:
$ nosetests
............../home/travis/virtualenv/python2.7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/utils.py:72: RuntimeWarning: Parent module 'requests' not found while handling absolute import
  from netrc import netrc, NetrcParseError
However I can't seem to reproduce it in a much simpler example, so I don't know if it's some specific combination of imports or something that nose/mock is doing. You can see that test here:
https://travis-ci.org/gds-operations/collectd-cdn/jobs/23515951#L48
Going back to v2.0.0 prior to a501b0c doesn't produce the same warning.
