I have a code that sends GET and POST requests every 10 seconds. But in case there is a delay, the POST requests line itself posts twice. I tried to debug this to the best of my ability and I couldn't but finalize that the library sends the requests twice, or it is something to do with TCP (but then the library should deal with it, right?
The code: # this is a general code to give an idea of my implementation
import requests
import time
while True:
source = requests.get(url)
result = source.json()
resp = request.post(another_url,json = result,headers)
time.sleep(10)
By default, this should be ok, but I don't understand why I get this :
If it is something to do with my code then please advise me, or otherwise I hope this bug can be fixed.
Thank you so much for this awesome library.
