Currently, when we try to pickle a Session object, we get this:
  File "[...]python2.7/copy_reg.py", line 70, in _reduce_ex
    raise TypeError, "can't pickle %s objects" % base.__name__
TypeError: can't pickle lock objects
The Session objects can be made pickleable rather easily. If you are willing to accept this functionality, I can create a pull request. I showed the implementation on my blog post about this.
