Hello!
I use lib and get requests with proxy on port 8080.
Example:
r=requests.get('http://www.rambler.ru/', proxies={'http:':'http://login:pass@x.x.x.x:8080', 'https:':'https://login:pass@x.x.x.x:8080'}, timeout=5)
Outgoing connections to port 80 on the server closed. And this request I freezes on this server. But running on the server where the 80 ports are open.
Also I see the blocked connection firewall on port 80.
