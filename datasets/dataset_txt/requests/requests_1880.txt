In version 2.0.0 when you try to get a document like this:
import requests
r = requests.get('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdEczcWduOXRUb1JUc1VGMmJtc2xXaXc&usp=sharing&output=csv')

print r.text
You get the CSV content, however with 2.1.0 you get the TooManyRedirects error (it tries 30 times), so it is not possible to download the document. Any idea where could it broken?
