It appears that when using a proxy bypass with an IP wthout a netmask causes an exception to be raised from requests in python <= 2.6.5. This is due to a bug in the stdlib which was fixed in 2.6.6.

This is another issue that pip hit with the recent 1.5 release that is occuring on older 2.6 releases.
