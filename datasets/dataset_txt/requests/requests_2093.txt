Until version 1.2.0 a Response object would keep all cookies set during a redirection chain. This behavior was changed in version 1.2.1 (commit 1e465fd).
cURL and, I believe, all major used browsers ( http://blog.dubbelboer.com/2012/11/25/302-cookie.html ) will keep cookies set during redirections for futher requests. This is not the current behavior for python-requests.
I propose to revert 1e465fd to keep python-requests in consistency with other implementations.
This was an issue that I found when dealing with Google Client Login and Google App Engine authentication. Current version forces me to look at each request from request.history to retrieve each cookie set during redirects. The default behavior should be the opposite, since there are few cases where someone would not keep cookies defined from previous redirects.
