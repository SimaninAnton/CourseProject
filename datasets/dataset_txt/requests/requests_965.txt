I want to hide my own IP address but it seems unstable as follows.
import requests
url = "http://httpbin.org/get"
proxy0 = {"http":"http://118.179.220.186:8080"} # just an example, it may have expired
proxy1 = {"http":"http://41.79.60.202:8080"}
r0 = requests.get(url, proxies=proxy0, timeout=5)
r1 = requests.get(url, proxies=proxy1, timeout=5)
r0.json()["origin"] 
r1.json()["origin"] 
When I tested it, the origin in r0 contained only one IP while that of r1 contained two IPs including the source IP.
The same problem was posted on StackOverflow, please refer to here.
