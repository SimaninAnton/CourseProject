I want to Post to a very big file to the server, will requests use the "chunk" mode ?
if
f = open("very big file")
requests.post(url, data=f)
From the PreparedRequest.prepare_body method, file length can get from util.super_len,
then the 'Content-Length' will be a number, which make chunk mode False.
Is these any way to use the chunk mode when post a big file ?
Thank you!
