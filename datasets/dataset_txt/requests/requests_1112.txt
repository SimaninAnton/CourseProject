Hello,
It would be nice if the response hook was called even if there is an error during the send() process flow.
Example, if a timeout occurs, the cb is not used and a requests constructed url and query data that can normally be saved via the cb is not available - that is, URL that caused a timeout.
Thanks for your consideration.
