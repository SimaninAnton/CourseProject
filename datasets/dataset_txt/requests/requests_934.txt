Hello,
I am having a terrible time figuring out what requests is doing here.
 print(r.url) #debug
 print(r.encoding)
 print(r.text)
 print(r.headers)
debugging commands in console produce:
payload in function is {"key1": "foo", "key2": "bar"}
http://0.0.0.0:5006/buy?%7B%22key1%22:%20%22foo%22,%20%22key2%22:%20%22bar%22%7D
ISO-8859-1```

The URL looks wrong to me, is it somehow being created incorrectly?
