The documentation makes only a single reference to the fact that requests provides some sort of context manager, and it's in the release notes from version 0.6 in 2011:

Would it be possible to get examples of how to implement these context managers? Specifically, I'm looking to replace the following code:

I can't find any place that documents how to use an equivalent requests context manager, so I'll have to dig through the code to find out. It would be nice to get a bit more visibility into the requests API...
