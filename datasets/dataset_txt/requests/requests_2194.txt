In older versions of requests (pre v1.0), I was able to do:
requests.get('http://nonexistentdomainfoobar.com', config={"max_retries":10})
as far as I can tell, this isn't possible in v.1.0+. HTTPAdapter.max_retries uses DEFAULT_RETRIES and there's no way to change this.
Would it be possible to restore this feature? If not, perhaps a note in the FAQ informing users that this isn't possible and they'll have to write a loop themselves?
