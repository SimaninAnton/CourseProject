I enjoy both requests.post(json=payload) and session.post(json=payload). I would like to have the same for both requests.put() and session.put().
In a cursory examination of the code, it looks like a simple change. I would be happy to create a pull request for it. Is there a reason the convenience wasn't already propagated to PUTs?
