The charade library in the packages directory is quite big (500kByte)
It is only needed if you give a response not encoding. I think this is an error in the code which uses the request library.
Zen of Python "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess."
I think the library should be optional, and not in this repository.
I prefer an exception, if I don't give encoding, since I would get this exception during development.
With the current implementation the guess could be good during development, and wrong in the live system.
