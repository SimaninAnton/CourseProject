When you send multiple concurrent requests (using gevent, in my case) to the same URL but with different auth parameters, every request will use the same auth parameters.
Reproduced with this code: https://gist.github.com/1300341
The sample code is using the regular api, but the bug is reproducible using requests.async as well.
