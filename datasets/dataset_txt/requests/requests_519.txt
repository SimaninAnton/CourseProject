Summary.
Seems a little overkill to have to do https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22346158/python-requests-how-to-limit-received-size-transfer-rate-and-or-total-time to deal with sites like the below. Would be nice to have that built in. But maybe thats asking to much.
Question on Stack: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46061786/python-requests-timeout-not-working/46061958#46061958
Expected Result
Error with running:
requests.get('http://arboleascity.com',timeout=(5,5),verify=False)
What you expected.
Would timeout in 5 seconds. But it does not. It works 99.9% of the time but for this site it does not.
Probably a bug. Any help?
Reproduction Steps
import requests
requests.get('http://arboleascity.com',timeout=(5,5),verify=False)
