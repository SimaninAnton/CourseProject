I've been dealing with that issue for 2 days and haven't come up with any sort of solution. I'm trying to write telegram bot with python using telebot library. Once i run the program, i get the following error:
'No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it'
Well, i was disappointed and decided to look up the issue on the internet. After some time passed, i got that the proxy may be the possible solution, so i utilized it. And, full of joy and delight, i started writing some code.
That's what i got so far:
import telebot
from telebot import apihelper
TOKEN = "token"
bot_obj = telebot.TeleBot(token=TOKEN, threaded=False)
@bot_obj.message_handler(comands=['start'])
def start(message):
bot_obj.send_message(message.from_user.id, "Howdy")
bot_obj.polling()
And that's what i ended up with:
"Not supported proxy scheme socks5"
