In [1]: import requests

In [2]: requests.__version__
Out[2]: '1.2.3'

In [3]: requests.get('http://mock.issues.com/404').status_code
Out[3]: 200

In [4]: requests.get('http://mock.issues.com/500').status_code
Out[4]: 200
mock.issues.com seems to be sending the correct HTTP status codes using other tools to check.
Am I doing something wrong, or is this broken?
