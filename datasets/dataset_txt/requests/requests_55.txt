Summary.
I have a url whose html response has to be assigned to a variable. In order to do that I am using the below code
resp = requests.get(url, timeout=05, verify=False)
html_output = resp.text
from the above html_output variable I am expecting the total html response of the page. However I am seeing a intermediate html output which says "If you're seeing this message, that means JavaScript has been disabled on your browser"
Expected Result
The response should contain actual html source code of the url which i have given.
