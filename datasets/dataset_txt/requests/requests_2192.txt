There is no way to dump request content. Currently digging with tcpdump and wireshark shows that the requests should be going through fine; r.history shows 302 and 401 for a digest authorization, and r.status_code gives 200.
Running curl with the data I'm giving is making the target Web application (a closed-source Java app) take state-altering actions. Running with Python requests is doing absolutely nothing.
The main problem here is I have absolutely no way to debug why this is happening.
