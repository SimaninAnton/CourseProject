I'd like to be able to write something which will catch any exceptions raised when performing a request, so I can handle them appropriately. However, I'm not sure which exceptions might get raised; looking at the code, I think urllib{,2,3} exceptions can occur, as well as ones from requests.exceptions.
Ideally, I'd like to be able to do try:... except requests.exceptions.RequestException and have that catch any exceptions due to making the HTTP request; this could probably be accomplished by monkeypatching the urllib exceptions to add RequestException as a base class, though maybe that's too ugly. Some documentation of what I need to catch, though, would be a good start.
