I'm making the assumption that there isn't a way that I don't know about :)
I'd like to be able to pass a subclass of models.Response to get, post etc. I know there is a response hook however I don't want to do something like response.__class__ = MyResponse or add custom methods to the Response instance one by one. Being able to subclass would be much cleaner, I have a patch (hopefully I can work out how to attach it).
