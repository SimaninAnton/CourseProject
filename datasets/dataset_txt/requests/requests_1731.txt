Hi,
And thanks for maintaining requests. When I set an Authorization header in a request, I do not expect it to be overwritten. I set up default credentials in my .netrc file (for automatizing the cadaver command line tool), and suddenly I could not authenticate to my service any longer.
Please check if an Authorization header does already exist in your default authorization handler, instead of overwriting it. I see that you documented this behaviour in the authentication section, but since I never used this form of authentication it took quite some time to find the problem. Also, overwriting a header that the user set does not seem to be a sensible implementation.
Thanks,
Joe
