c008bf3 introduced a factual error in to the documentation for the params parameter.
The old text was
:param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query string for the :class:Request.
which was replaced by
:param params: (optional) Dictionary, list of tuples or bytes to send in the body of the :class:Request.
Bold emphasis mine. Obviously params still go in the query parameter, no functionality was changed. This was probably a copy and paste error following 2d1b448.
Please replace body with query string.
