We have a whole code branch that does chunked uploads that is not and has never been tested. That's a problem, because sometimes it breaks and we don't notice (#2861). I'd like to add more testing for chunked uploads.
However, we can't use httpbin to do this testing. This is because the WSGI spec staunchly refuses to let applications see chunked transfer encoding at the app layer. For this reason, to test chunked transfer encoding requires a new style of testing, one that doesn't involve running a WSGI server but instead running something that can see the bytes as they hit the wire. Basically, something like the socket level tests of urllib3.
