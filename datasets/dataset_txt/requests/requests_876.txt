When url contains an underscore the request fails with 'URL has an invalid label error'
Seems like a result of updating to urllib3 to 1.19.
While underscores in the hostname would not meet strict RFC requirements it would still work in many scenarios, so I would propose to remove the check
Example:
requests.get('http://test_t')
*** InvalidURL: URL has an invalid label.
