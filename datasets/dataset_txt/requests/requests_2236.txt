Should the result of dispatch_hook actually be returned? Seems to make no sense to store it as a property of the session object.
The documentation states:
"If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to replace the data that was passed in. If the function doesnâ€™t return anything, nothing else is effected."
Another thing I've noticed, and don't quite understand, is that hooks are executed by the adapter as well, and that hooks are not preserved when the PreparedRequest is being generated.
