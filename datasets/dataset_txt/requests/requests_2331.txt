I have a url that I can load instantly in my browser. However, when I load it from Python (I tried urllib2 also), I get about a 5 second delay. The same delay happens if I use curl.
I did a little bit of profiling, and it looks like it's getting hung up in a getaddrinfo() call, which I'm not sure why it needs to make, but I would like to bypass. I can bypass it if I access the url with an IP instead of hostname, but for maintainability, I would rather not do this in the long term.
Wondering if you know why some of these libraries are doing the reverse DNS lookup, and if you would consider providing an option to bypass it?
