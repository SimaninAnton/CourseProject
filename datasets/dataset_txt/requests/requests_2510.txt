The command
resp = get(url, verify=False, prefetch=True, timeout=20)
does not read the whole content, i.e., len(resp.text) differs from the expected value.
The expected page size is in the range 50-60 KB, while len(resp.text) is about 8 KB.
I have tried get(url) as well, but I have not noticed any difference.
I have made some tests with other libraries (i.e., https://github.com/Lispython/human_curl or a Java client), and I get the expected behavior.
