It seems that if there's a problem with obtaining the body of a request, requests throws an error while trying to read it.
Code:
import requests

def main():
    r = requests.get("some-flaky-url")
    if not r.content:
        raise Exception('content was flaky')
    return r.content

main()
error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 5, in main:
    if not r.content:
  File "eggs/requests-0.7.4-py2.6.egg/requests/models.py", line 499, in content
    self._content = self.raw.read()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'
