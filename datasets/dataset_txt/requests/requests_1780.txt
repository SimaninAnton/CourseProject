I have noticed that requests sessions don't send referrer links, at least in what I tried, nor have I found any mention of referrers in the documentation. The only mention of referrers in the entire request source happens in the http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/http/server.py#l1088 file.
Can anyone give information about the status of this header field?
