There's an interesting bug that I've run into involving reading a zipfile off the web.
The details as in the comments to this answer on StackOverflow:
This fails with a BadZipFileError:
z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(requests.get("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Broadband-Data-Dig-Datasets/ft4n-yqee").content))
But writing requests.get("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Broadband-Data-Dig-Datasets/ft4n-yqee").content to a file and then opening it with ZipFile works fine. So this works:
with open("temp.zip", "wb") as fp:
    fp.write(requests.get("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Broadband-Data-Dig-Datasets/ft4n-yqee").content)

with open("temp.zip", "rb") as fp:
    zipcontent = zipfile.ZipFile(fp)
    
This is on Python 3.5.2 and Requests 2.12.4.
