FYI I think there might still be a cookies related issue... I was having issues two weeks ago with cookies.py in 2.5.3 i think, but I have downloaded the new requests 2.6 running on raspberry pi for a datalogger every minute, and it's much better but now it segfaults every 24 hours or so in a slightly different place. (FYI I'm not very competent on python debugging yet)
Traceback show's it segfaulting on line 241 in python2.7/rfc822.py (it shows as line 243 in my screenshot but I had already added a couple of lines above for debugging - it is whatever line "for line in self.headers" is on in getAllMatchingHeaders), invoked ultimately from requests/cookies.py.
The process is just repeatedly loading a webserver.html page on a PLC we have on our intranet, to read it's variables, so it's not going over the internet.
When running, normally the 'lst' variable is always returned as [] so I dont even need this procedure and for now I've bypassed the "for line in self.headers" bit to keep it from segfaulting once a day.
If you want more info do please let me know what you need.
And of course, thanks for the great work.
