When trying to open https://www.scbt.com with requests, an SSLError is raised, even though verify=False. Apache HttpClient has the same problem, but browsers open the page without any complaint. I was hoping requests would be more tolerant with such flawed servers, especially if the caller indicates that security is not of importance.
