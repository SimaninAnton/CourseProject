Observe this link to an article: http://alaxon.co.il/article/%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8/
If you click it, you'll see Hebrew letters in your address bar. (At least in Chrome.) The article works.
Now, try accessing it in requests:
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('http://alaxon.co.il/article/%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8/')
