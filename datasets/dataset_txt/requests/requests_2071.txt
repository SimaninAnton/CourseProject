I've been using requests 1.2.0 to log into a server, but when I upgraded to 1.2.3 today I found that a change in 1.2.1 breaks my code.
I log in with the line
response = requests.post(<endpoint>, data={'username':<username>, 'password':<password>})
The server responds with a 302 that sets the authentication cookies and redirects me to the welcome page. In 1.2.0, the authentication cookies can be found in the response variable's cookies, but not in 1.2.1.
I haven't found what change in the code is causing this different behavior, but I did notice that in the response variable I can access the history and get the cookies from the 302 response, so I'm guessing the issue is with the redirect.
