I'm writing a script to track keywords in the twitter realtime api.
At first, I was using requests v0.10.8. Showing the tweets was almost instant, but the issue #515 occured frequently.
Then I upgraded requests to v0.11.1. Now #515 is resolved, but apparently small chunks are not processed instantly, if they don't reach the chunk_size. By setting the chunk size to a value like 10, it works, but that can't be the solution :)
