When servers send a Content-Encoding header requests (actually urllib3, but because of decode_content=True kwarg requests passes) will automatically decode the response. In pip this is causing a breakage for servers that serve a .tar.gz with a Content-Encoding: gzip header. Would it be at all possible to have iter_content support a content_decode kwarg that just get's passed through to urllib3?
