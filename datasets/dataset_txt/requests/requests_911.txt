So I ran into this while working on a more complex project however here is a short demo to showcase the bug.
NOTE: I highly recommend you open some type of task viewer program to monitor RAM usage and know when to Ctrl C to prevent your OS from crashing.
Steps to Reproduce:
a. Create Directory
b. Create two new files in the directory called script.py and queue.py
c. Put the following code into script.py:
import requests
d. Put the following code into queue.py:
from subprocess import call
call(['python','script.py'])
e. Now run the following command:
python script.py
Your computer should now begin rapidly using RAM and will eventually crash (took about 30 seconds for my Ubuntu install to crash on a rig with 8 GB of RAM.)
