As far as I can understand from the docs, it is possible to upload files using the 'files' keyword param, but it requires a file object. I have a case where I have the data in memory, and it would require me to store to a temp file, which I would like to prevent if possible.
Would it be possible for requests to support in-memory data upload for multipart?
