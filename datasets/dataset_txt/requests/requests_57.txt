I am running the following from the python repl with logs set to DEBUG:
response = requests.get(
    url=endpoint_url,
    auth=requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth(username, password),
)
This results in:
[2019-08-27 13:47:23,361 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:815] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): my.url.com:port
[2019-08-27 13:47:23,532 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:396] https://my.url.com:port "GET /some/important/endpoint?$skiptoken='12345' HTTP/1.1" 401 0
[2019-08-27 13:47:24,086 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:396] https://my.url.com:port "GET /some/important/endpoint?$skiptoken='12345' HTTP/1.1" 200 951999
Why am I seeing a 401 response logged before the final 200?
Is there something wrong with the authentication?
In addition to this I sometimes (very rarely) have a situation where the request never returns and only printed the 401 log. What is causing this error.
See also my stackoverflow question for more details.
