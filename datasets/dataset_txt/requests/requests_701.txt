Is there an ETA on 2.14? I couldn't find any milestone info and there seems to be a few dozen PRs merged since January.
There should probably be a line about the release schedule in the contributors guide or elsewhere, so I people like me don't ask annoying questions.
I don't mean to prod for a release, but just get a general idea of when one will likely be made. I've got a couple of tiny open source projects that rely on a handful of the forthcoming changes and just want to know when I should schedule an afternoon for packaging and updates.
