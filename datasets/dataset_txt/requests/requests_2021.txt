When I try a pip install requests in Cygwin 64 bit the installation fails.
Here's the end of the log file:

Don't know if that is a problem with the installation package, or cygwin itself. But thought I'd try here first.
If I try to use easy_install it just leaves all the files in the tmp-dir. And if I from there try to do a python setup.py install, and then try to import requests from the python shell, it just exits without and output.
