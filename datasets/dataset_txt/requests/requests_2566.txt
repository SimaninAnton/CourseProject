It's possible for a server to instruct a client to redirect to a URL by using the http-equiv meta tag. It's antiquated, but it's still out there, and browsers still handle it as a redirect.
Should requests honor the http-equiv refresh, handling it essentially the same as a 301? I'd like to think so, because that's what browsers do. To do so would mean having requests parse the section of the response body -- which shouldn't be too difficult or inefficient (even without BeautifulSoup ;). Has this been considered/addressed?
