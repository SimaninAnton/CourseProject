The keywords headers value must be string or buffer?
If the keywords dnt and upgrade-insecure-requests value is string or buffer, it's right,but the value is int,it's wrong.Why is that?
Right:
   'dnt': '1',
    'upgrade-insecure-requests': '1',
Wrong:
   'dnt': 1,
    'upgrade-insecure-requests': 1,
Why?
