Hi:
I'm having a problem when making PUT requests. This problem is not present on version 0.14.2, but it has arisen when I updated the module.
It seems that the content of the PUT (data), which should be encoded as a POST, is not being properly encoded. At least, I am not able to receive it when checking on the server. It appears as empty. If I try the 'params' parameter, then it is properly encoded as a QueryParam.
The curious thing is that using a POST seems to work fine. I assume that the interface is still the same.
