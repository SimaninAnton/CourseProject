In requests there doesn't seem to be a way to specify an SSL key and certificate for client certificate auth.
urllib and httplib both support the client cert approach. This is a commonly requested implementation for business to business communications.
Is this something that we would use the custom auth approach for, using the interface to bind the values to the internal urllib object... or, what?
Just want to get a handle on whether or not this is achievable using requests.
