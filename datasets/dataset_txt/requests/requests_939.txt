When I use requests.get('http://www.google.com')
It throws a ProxyError:
ProxyError: HTTPConnectionPool(host=My vps's IP , port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: http://www.google.com/ (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x03EB66F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 10061] ',)))
When I use the HTTP Protocol request website, the host will turn into my vps's IP. Although I shutdown the VPN. But userHTTPS Protocol will not appear this issue.
