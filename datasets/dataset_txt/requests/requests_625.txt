The newly released v2.17.1 of the requests package introduced an issue in that urllib3 is no longer in requests.packages:
python -c "import zhmcclient; print('Import: ok')"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "zhmcclient/__init__.py", line 30, in <module>
    from ._session import *       # noqa: F401
  File "zhmcclient/_session.py", line 29, in <module>
    from requests.packages import urllib3
ImportError: cannot import name urllib3
Version 2.17.0 and before worked fine.
We circumvented this issue by fixing the version of requests to 2.17.0, for now.
Expected Result
urllib3 is again in requests.packages.
Actual Result
urllib3 is no longer in requests.packages.
Reproduction Steps
from requests.packages import urllib3
System Information
This could be reproduced on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and on all OS platforms that we test on (Ubuntu, OS-X and Windows).
