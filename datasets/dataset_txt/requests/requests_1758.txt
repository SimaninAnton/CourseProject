I would like to iterator over chunks coming from a service, where each chunk is a JSON blob (similar to the example in the docs). However, in this service, there are no newlines after each chunk. As a result, it seems that iter_lines only yields one line, which is the entire response (not chunked), and iter_content yields one character at a time.
Is it possible to use this library to stream data from this service?
Thanks!
