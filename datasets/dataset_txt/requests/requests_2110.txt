Hi, I'm quite new to the world of Python, so might be missing something. When I submitted this pull request the other day, @sigmavirus24's response was surprising. Surely, putting a checkout of a third party library in your repository is not the right way to manage dependencies?
Can't you use requirements.txt to include urllib3 or at least make it a git submodule?
