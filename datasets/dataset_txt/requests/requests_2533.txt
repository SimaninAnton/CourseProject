Every time I read the sidebar in the docs, I stumble upon "Support Requests", automatically assuming I'll find info on issue trackers or other means to request support. While I get: "If you love Requests, consider making a small donation on Flattr: "
But of course "requests" here is the name of the project and not the verb.
Could you maybe change the title to "Donate"?
