Maybe we could use the opportunity of breaking with things in 3.0 to nag users about reverting many users behaviour of specifying verify=False and squelching the resulting warnings by default.
One way would be to introduce a new warning or putting verify=False into eternal deprecation mode.
Pros:
May lead users to adapt their code to be more secure
Cons:
Will probably lead to more tickets here and questions on SO
Could be interpreted as a intentional breaking existing stuff, ill meaning
Could lead users to inhibit all DeprecationWarnings by default
I am actually not completely convinced this is worth the hassle to be honest, but think it is worthy of a discussion.
(Counting a short "The heck?! no way!" as a discussion here)
