It took me two full days of work to discover that python-requests was using the credentials from the ~/.netrc file and ignoring the ones that I was specifing.
I think that the correct behaviour should be to use the specified ones and ignore the netrc ones. Even the documentations seems to agree with me. Still, this is not what I discovered.
