I'am trying to use the requests library by making a redirection with Digest authentication method, but the response is 401. I mention that it works with basic authentication. I've captured the packets with wireshark, and noticed that the first HTTP request is without the Authorization header, the 401 unauthorized answered is received, and after that the traffic continues as it should be, the Authorization header is added, the 302 answer is received, and after that with the https cyphers exchange. I don't know why the requests.send method returns 401.
