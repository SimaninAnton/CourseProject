Hey, sorry if I'm going about this in the wrong way, new to this.
I was attempting to install requests to a new virtualenv using python3 and pip. It failed with the following:

When I tried the same with python 2.7.2 it worked fine and installed without any issues.
I modified api.py, line 22 from from adapters import HTTPAdapter to from .adapters import HTTPAdapter and it seemed to fix the problem when installing with python3. I also tried reinstalling into a new virtualenv using python 2.7.2 with the above change and it seemed to work fine.
I'm pretty much brand new to python, so the the above change could have more consequences than I'm aware of, but I just thought I'd let you know.
Thanks.
