In my project i need to perform fire and forget for REST-API post and patch calls.
My current solution is:
try:
    requests.post(my_uri, params=data
                  timeout=1e-4)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    pass
I think a nicer solution could be:
requests.fire_and_forget(my_uri, method='post', params=data)
Where method default argument is 'post'

My current solution is not perfect since the size of the timeout is relevant. If I set it to 1e-8 and include data it will break before I have sent the data.
