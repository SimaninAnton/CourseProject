This feature is used when client wants to check whether request body will be accepted by server before sending the body.
This is achieved by setting "Expect: 100-continue" request header. Server will respond with status line "100 Continue HTTP/1.1" if request headers are ok, or with actual full response if something goes wrong. Client should not send body if response was not "100 Continue HTTP/1.1"
