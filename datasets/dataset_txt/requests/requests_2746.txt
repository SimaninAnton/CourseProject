This looks like it should work but doesn't, but it does with the urllib2 line that's commented out. I'm using requests 0.6 and lxml 2.3
import urllib2
import requests
import lxml.etree as etree
#page = urllib2.urlopen(url)
r = requests.get('http://www.google.com')
parser = etree.HTMLParser()
tree = etree.parse(r, parser) # first parameter can be a file like object http://lxml.de/tutorial.html#parsing-from-strings-and-files
I get TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
