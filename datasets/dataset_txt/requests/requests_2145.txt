It would be useful to be able to attach additional data to request by passing these data to send() and other api functions like get() etc. We can think of these data as a context in which given request was sent so context seems like appropriate name for such a parameter. This is especially useful in async scenario but not only. See spyoungtech/grequests/issues/33 The idea is to have request store only these data for later retrieval by user - it wouldn't be used by Requests anywhere in the process of sending request.
