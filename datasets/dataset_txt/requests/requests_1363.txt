hi, i try to use Proxy-Authorization header with my request, but it doesn't appear in request headers. If i change header name to 'Proxy-Authorization1', for example, everything is ok, i can see it in output.
proxy = {'http': 'http://ip:port/'}
token = base64.encodestring('user:pass').strip()
headers = {'Proxy-Authorization': 'Basic ' + token, 'Proxy-Connection': 'Keep-Alive', 'Accept': '*/*'}

r = requests.get('http://url', headers=headers, proxies=proxy) 
the reason why i'm trying to do this - with authentication like 'http://user:pass@ip.port' or via HTTPBasicAuth request fails with 407 Authentication Required
so, is there a way to explicitly define Proxy-Authorization header ?
