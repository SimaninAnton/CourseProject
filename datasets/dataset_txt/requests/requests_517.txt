Summary.
Lots of libraries use requests. If there's an error verifying SSL in a third-party library it'd be useful to be able to just set an env var to disable SSL verification while the issue is fixed in the failing library.
This issue is currently affecting me and others after upgrading google-cloud. Even modifying that library to pass verify=False would be no mean feat.
