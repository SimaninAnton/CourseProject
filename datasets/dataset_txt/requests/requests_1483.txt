Hello,
Even if the icy's protocol is broken, I would still need to download the streaming data of a shoutcast server.
When attempting to, I get this issue:
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/api.py", line 55, in get
return request('get', url, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/api.py", line 44, in request
return session.request(method=method, url=url, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 455, in request
resp = self.send(prep, *_send_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 558, in send
r = adapter.send(request, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 378, in send
raise ConnectionError(e)
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='streaming3.radiocat.net', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /;listen.mp3 (Caused by ProtocolError('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine('ICY 200 OK\r\n',)))
Any workaround or something I could do?
Thanks.
