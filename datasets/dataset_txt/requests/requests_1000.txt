This leads to confusion, as demonstrated by #3201 (ping @thanatos), but it's not a documentation issue, it's a design issue. Connections and sessions are unrelated: a connection can be used by multiple sessions, and a session can span multiple connections; thus the library shouldn't tie them together.
