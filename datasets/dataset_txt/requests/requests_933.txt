Hi,
I am trying to handle and recovery intermittent-network conditions while using requests.
I tried this very-simple script:
https://gist.github.com/lrodorigo/30b00c20f5994aaf2911d7443b8f1f15
And i noticed as follows:
if the script is started with wifi-on it works as expected (Connection Alive and exception traceback printed coherently with network status)
if the script is started with wifi-off it continously raise ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='www.google.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded exception, even if I connect to the internet while it's running.
I'm running on Arch Linux Kernel 4.5.4-1-ARCH, Python 2.7.11 x64, Requests v2.10.0
Anyone experienced this kind of issue?
