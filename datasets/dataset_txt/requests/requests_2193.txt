According to #1204 requests should fully support HTTP proxies. However, the SSL verification is broken on my system.
If requesting without a proxy, I'm getting as expected:
>>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org')
requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname 'kennethreitz.org' doesn't match either 
of '*.herokuapp.com', 'herokuapp.com'
However, doing the same request via an HTTP proxy:
>>> proxies = {'http': 'http://...', 'https': 'http://...'}
>>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', proxies=proxies)
