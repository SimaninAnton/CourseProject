raise InvalidSchema("No connection adapters were found for '%s'" % url)
requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: <exception str() failed>
Getting the above error when I do:
headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36'}
r = requests.get(page_url, headers=headers)
Where page_url is the URL of the webpage I'm requesting. I've confirmed the URL is correct and stored in page_url properly; the issue appears to be the fact that I'm grabbing the URL from a file. Replacing page_url with the actual URL removes the error. Is there some issue with using a URL that's stored in a variable rather than hardcoding it or something?
