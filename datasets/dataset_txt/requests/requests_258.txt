I got an error about "ConnectionError" when I using thirdparty sdk to request server.
The thirdparty sdk is using requests to request server.
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(54, 'Connection reset by peer'))
I spent a long time looking for the error.
I print the request url from sdk source code, finally know why I get the error.
The sdk server domain has changed "https", but sdk source code still use "http".
Error message never tell me current url is "http" or "https".
If I can get the request url from error message, I will know how to fix that as soon as.
