At https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L378 you call
conn._get_conn(timeout=timeout)
The timeout object you pass is a Timeout but that internal method in urllib3 expects a float. This results in a type error about float + Timeout.
A float works there but I wasn't sure which to use.
