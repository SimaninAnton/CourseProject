In some cases it could be useful, that response would act as a string:
>>> response = requests.get('https://api.thing.somewhere/size/blah', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> response.status_code
200
>>> "Blah is %d big" % response
Blah is 3242 big
>>> response.headers['content-type']
'text/plain'
is it contrary to pythonic ideas?
