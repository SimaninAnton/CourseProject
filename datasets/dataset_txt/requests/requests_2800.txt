I'm confused why an Authorization header isn't sent on the first request, and seems dependent on a 401 coming back to trigger another request with the Authorization header?
import requests

r = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/", auth=('test', 'test'))
esummers@roentgenium:~$ netcat -l localhost 8080
POST / HTTP/1.1
