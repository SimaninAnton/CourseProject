Consider the following redirection chain:
POST /do_something HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
...

HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: /new_thing_1513

GET /new_thing_1513
Host: server.example.com
...

HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513
The intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to
a GET. The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET. However, because
Session.resolve_redirects starts each iteration by copying the original
request object, Requests will issue a POST!
