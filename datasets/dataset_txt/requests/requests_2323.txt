First at all, thanks for porting requests to the asynchronous world, I loved it!
However I'm using Eventlet instead of Gevent so I adapted the code to make
it work with Eventlet. You can see it at https://github.com/jmg/erequests.
I was wondering if we can make a unified version where the library can
detect or be configured to use either Eventlet or Gevent based on the user
needs.
Many thanks.
