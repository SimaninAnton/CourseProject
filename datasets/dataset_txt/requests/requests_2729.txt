I am calling a service like this:
import requests
resp = requests.get('http://example.com/some/url', params={'id': 1})
The service responds with a series of 302 redirects.
I am seeing this exchange.
client> GET /some/url?id=1 HTTP/1.1
client> Host: example.com

server< HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
server< Location: http://example.com/some/url?id=1&extra_data=2

## this is the bad request right here. Note the [('id', 1)] stuck on the end
client> GET /some/url?id=1&extra_data=2&[('id', 1)] HTTP/1.1.
client> Host: example.com

# the server of course doesn't like it
server< HTTP/1.0 400 Bad request.
Any ideas why this may be happening?
