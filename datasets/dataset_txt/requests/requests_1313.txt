Using the json param when making a request is awesome:
payload = {'blip': 'blaz'}
r = requests.get('http://foo.bar', json=payload)
Using the response property is great as well, especially since you can use a custom json decoder:
r.json(cls=MyCustomDecoder)
It would be nice to allow a param to be passed that could be applied to the dumps of the json value.
payload = {'blip': Decimal(69)}
json_params = {'cls': MyCustomEncoder}
r = requests.get('http://foo.bar', json=payload, json_params=json_params)
