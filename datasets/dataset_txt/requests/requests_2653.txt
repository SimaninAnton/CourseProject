This: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/develop/requests/models.py#L375 would indicate that files passed in files are being read into memory in their entirety. This is likely to get pathological for large files; the underlying poster library supports streaming requests. The solution to this issue is probably related to #292.
