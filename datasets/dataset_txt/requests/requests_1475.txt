I'm using requests with an internal CA which is trusted on my machines. I recently discovered that you can modify the code in certs.py to return the system CA bundle (thus allowing verified HTTPS requests), but I think this should really be an option, not a modification to the module.
And since we all use venvs to dev, simply adding it to the Requests bundle is not a very elegant solution.
