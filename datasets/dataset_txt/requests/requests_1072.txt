I'm not sure if this is actually the case, but from looking at the code it appears to be. To motivate my use case, I am using chunked transfer-encoding mode for the request since I want to support streaming from an underlying service, so the content length is unknown and could be very long. It appears that if the server sends a response prior to the request body being completely sent, we wouldn't know about it, which would be quite bad for something like a redirect or an error condition that was detected very early in the stream. In particular, in a redirect case we certainly don't want to re-send the entire stream.
Is there a good way around this?
