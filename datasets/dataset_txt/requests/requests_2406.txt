I've a problem that I've traced back to the method/property "text" of Request. Chadet is returning the wrong encoding "ISO-8859-2" when the string is UTF-8! The result are, as you can imagine, nasty strings everywhere you have something that is not ascii. This is happening in production :(
What can I do?
You are shipping chardet with requests :(
