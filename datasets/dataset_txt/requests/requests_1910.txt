Whenever a request made with an OAuth1 auth object results in a redirect to a new location, it would then result in the Authorization header becoming invalid (wrong signature) thus making the function provided by allow_redirect ultimately useless in the context of an OAuth1 session. A potential fix is to call prepare_auth again after the prepare_cookies in the resolve_redirects loop, but I have no idea what potential side effects are and how to begin writing a test in that gigantic method within a loop so no pull requests from me, for now.
