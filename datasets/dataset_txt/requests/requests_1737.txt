Hello.
As a matter of feature request, it would be useful to have a gevent-compatible adapter for requests which would not require any dangerous monkey-patching.
By now, I've tried combining requests with geventhttpclient; that works, but it is a large hack if it is done in a separate module ( https://gist.github.com/anonymous/699cf4beba490024e52c
) (and I don't want to break external compatbility with requests by trying to use completely different pool and response classes).
