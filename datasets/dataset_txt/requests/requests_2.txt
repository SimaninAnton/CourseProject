I was trying to use the following tutorial to run a Graph/Python/Django server tutorial:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/python
I get the following error message:
requests.exceptions.ProxyError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='login.microsoftonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /groupebpcestaging.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', OSError('Tunnel connection failed: 407 authenticationrequired',)))
I use a proxy indeed.
I saw some post saying that it's not for sure supporting. So I'm wondering what's the status here. It's a http proxy.
