While trying to get access token from api I getting the follwoing error,
ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /oauth2/access_token/ (Caused by <class 'socket.gaierror'>: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution)
Is there any way I can resolve this error?
Thanks.
