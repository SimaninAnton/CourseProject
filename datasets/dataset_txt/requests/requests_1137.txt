The version/language selector widget causes problems when switching languages. As it's redundant with the Translations sidebar item, maybe removing the links would be OK?
Reproducing
Go to http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/ (i.e. not the home page)
Click "v:master"
Click a language (e.g. "de")
