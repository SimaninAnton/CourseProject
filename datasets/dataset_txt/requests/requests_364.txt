A POST request changed to GET request when the Request object got 3xx answer from server.
I don't know the RFC exactly, but the expected result would be that request repeat as POST at new URL.
Here is the code:
r = requests.post("http://foobar.com/script", data={'foo': 'bar'})
The server answer:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Thu, 15 Feb 2018 10:42:16 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
Location: https://foobar.com/script
Content-Length: 222
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
Then Request repeats the request as GET.
Debian Linux 9.3
Python3 (3.5.3)
Apache2.4 (the server where Request sends the request)
>>> requests.__version__
'2.12.4'
I've changed the url to https schema, then it works.
