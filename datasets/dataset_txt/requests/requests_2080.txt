I am trying to redirect my python requests through Fiddler2 so I can monitor what is going on. As far as I know I have set up Fiddler correctly because I can see my http requests going through. However, my https requests are getting this error:
An exception of type SSLError occured, these were the arguments:
(SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, 'EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:547)'),),)
My code looks like this:
proxies = {
    "http":"http://127.0.0.1:8888",
    "https":"https://127.0.0.1:8888",
}
url1='https://membership.usairways.com/Login.aspxReturnUrl=http:%2f%2fwww.usairways.com%2fdefault.aspx'
s = requests.Session()
s.mount('https://', ssladapter.SSLAdapter(ssl_version = PROTOCOL_SSLv3))
r1 = s.get(url1, proxies = proxies)                                      #USair Home Page
I have tried other https web addresses and I get the same error.
The code works fine if I remove the proxies argument(but is fine for http). Any ideas?
