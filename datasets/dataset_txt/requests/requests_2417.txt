I hope it's not something I'm doing wrong but...
import requests
requests.get('https://graph.facebook.com')
and I get this:
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:480: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
in line 604 of requests/models.py
My cert_loc seems to be going with the DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH, which is certifi/cacert.pem.
I made sure that I have the latest certifi, too. Anyone have any ideas?
