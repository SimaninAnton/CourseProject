Last week I started exploring requests library for invoking REST APIs, it was working fine, I was able to make calls as expected but today when I run the same python script, it fails with below error. Please help.
My OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Python: Python 2.7.12
requests library version: 2.18.1
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "restfilters.py", line 15, in
vcsession = vcrest.get_vc_session(vcip,"Administrator","password")
File "/home/vmware/vcrest.py", line 19, in get_vc_session
