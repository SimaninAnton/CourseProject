On the topic of requests not mapping exceptions to its own exceptions...
requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError is not caught. Reproduction: invalid status line.
Server:
$ echo | nc -l 8000
requests:
import requests
try:
    requests.get('http://localhost:8000')
except Exception as e:
    print (e.__class__)
Output: <class 'requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError'>
I would expect this to be mapped to a requests exception.
Connection refused comes out also as ProtocolError.
This is requests 2.4.0.
Ping @Lukasa , @sigmavirus24
Also happens with connection refused. This should be covered by requests unittests in the future.
