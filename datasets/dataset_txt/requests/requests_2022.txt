why not use a default encoding in Response's text property?if the server does not set content-type explicitly, why not use a default encoding such as utf-8? the chardet.detect() function is time consuming. if some one just use response.text and does aware the inner mechanism, he may think the Requests library is too slow and change to other libraries.
