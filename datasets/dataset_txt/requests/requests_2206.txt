If I prepare a request as follows:
req = requests.Request('get', url="http://localhost/", params=[("param1", "value1"), ("param1", "value2")])
prep = req.prepare()
prep.url is "http://localhost/?param1=value1&param1=value2" as expected. However if I call:
resp = requests.get(url="http://localhost/", params=[("param1", "value1"), ("param1", "value2")])
then resp.url is "http://localhost/?param1=value2"
I would expect requests.get to allow for repeated parameters.
