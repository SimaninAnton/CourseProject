Commit a721d59 as applied to request/session.py removes the following (lines 297-299, after request call succeeds):
# Response manipulation hook.
self.response = dispatch_hook('response', hooks, resp)
At the moment, my code which relies on this response property in the Session object works fine with the current 1.1.0 release from PyPI but breaks with this commit. Is there a reason why this hook was removed? It presents a significant compatibility issue.
