After the recent discussion about SSL compression both in urllib3/urllib3#109
and #1583 (this issue was about performance reason, it got me to look at other projects, performance is not the reason for this issue) I looked at the behaviour of other popular open source projects. It turned out that the following projects disable the compression by default for [security reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit\)):
Nginx, July 2012 (version 1.2.2, version 1.3.2, the development version to 1.4
Apache2, (version 2.2.25, version 2.4.4)
The upcoming version 2.7 of the Pound reverse proxy (the CHANGELOG file in the source archive: http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.7b.tgz)
Curl 7.28.1 July 2012
CPython >= 3.4 (http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/98eb88d3d94e)
This are the only projects I have looked at. I am sure we can find more if necessary.
As the stdlib ssl module does not allow us to change this parameter before 3.3
I propose to raise the issue on the CPython bug tracker, so that SSL
compression will be disabled by default (with the possibility to manually
enable it on 3.3 and later).
The current handlich of CPython 3.4 and up only disables compression on openssl
1.0 and up, as the relevant constant has not introduced before. However the
nginx changelog claims to also disable compression on earlier versions. I will
look into this.
This issue is meant to gather feedback and momentum before raising the issue with CPython (and maybe also the other implementations)
