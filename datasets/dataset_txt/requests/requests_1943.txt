I'm using session to POST in a page to login, the problem is, most of time it works, and a few times it doesn't, the response headers comes different even if the request headers are exactly the same.
What should be the problem, that two identical request headers obtain two different responses?
Is it a persistance error on Requests Session?
Here's how I'm using it:
 s = requests.Session()
 p=s.post('https://acesso.uol.com.br/login.html', data=pData, verify=False)
