To reproduce, add a print to requests.models.Request.send():
def send(self, anyway=False, prefetch=False):
    """...."""
    print "send with timeout %s" % self.timeout
Then:
>>> requests.head('http://httpbin.org/redirect/3', timeout=10)
send with timeout 10
send with timeout None
send with timeout None
send with timeout None
<Response [200]>
I expected a timeout of 10 everywhere, not None.
