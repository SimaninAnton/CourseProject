Hi
Tried to install today, and got an ascii error on illegal character in HISTORY.rst.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "setup.py", line 33, in
history = f.read()
File "/usr/lib/python3.4/encodings/ascii.py", line 26, in decode
return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 472: ordinal not in range(128)
Turns out it is the line just before 'Session.merge_enfiroment_settings' under 2.4.0 (2014-08-29). It is not a normal "-" but some other kind of horizontal line.
Creating an empty HISTORY.rst solves the problem.
