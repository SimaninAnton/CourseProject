Using Python 3, and request, I'm able to POST some registers of measurements to my server, something like 20 records, everything works ok, but when I try to upload more registers the URL becomes too long and I have this response on my python linux terminal:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>414 Request-URI Too Long</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Request-URI Too Long</h1>
<p>The requested URL's length exceeds the capacity
limit for this server.<br />
</p>
<hr>
<address>Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at api.rookmotion.com Port 443</address>
</body></html>
The URL that I'm trying to post currently has a length of 333 char long.
r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params = data)
print(len(r.text))
print(r.text)
But if I use the printed json on POSTMAN with the corresponding headers, POSTMAN works ok, so I don't know what should I configure additionally on my python request.
headers = {'user': self.user, 'key': self.password, 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'}
       
url = "https://api.rookmotion.com/v1.0/..."
Thanks!
