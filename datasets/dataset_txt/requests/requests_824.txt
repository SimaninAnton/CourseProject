I tried to scrap report from https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/datawarehouse/ConsolidatedDailyVolumeOIReport.shtml?selectionForm=
We can find Report Date, Asset Class and a Submit button
When we hit submit it actually opens in a new Tab as
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/datawarehouse/ConsolidatedDailyVolumeOIReport.shtm
I tried simulating POST, but it always says Session Time Out.
On Contrast if you could see
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/175.
When you enter dates and hit submit, it opens but not in a new tab, in this case requests is able to get the data.
Is there any solution for this? Please suggest.
