Hi
I am developing an application with python, using requests library in it.
I make executable file with pyinstaller library.
My application works with newest version of requests when I run it through python commands or inside IDLE. But when I get EXE output with pyinstaller, It doesn't run correctly. Here is the message:
"
... (trace files)
ImportError: No module named 'queue'
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
... (trace files)
ImportError: No module named 'urllib3'
Failed to execute script.
"
So I figured out that there is something wrong with urllib3 library. Then I downgraded requests to "2.11.1" version (One before updating bundled urllib3 to 1.19) and created another EXE file. Rerun it, and worked!
Now I know that there is something wrong with newer versions of requests (> 2.11.1) and pyinstaller. But don't know how to fix it. Could you plz help me?
Thanks.
