Installing the latest (2.5.1) or 2.5.0 (in the examples, below), installs a version that can't be uninstalled or upgraded, though it imports without a problem. I show how 2.2.0 (my previous version) didn't have this problem.
Install 2.5.0:
dustin@deploy1:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages$ sudo pip install requests==2.5.0
Downloading/unpacking requests==2.5.0

Can successfully import:
dustin@deploy1:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import requests
>>> 
Can't uninstall, though:
dustin@deploy1:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages$ sudo pip uninstall requests

Cleanup, manually:
