Have run into an issue while trying to access https over proxy. Have had no issues doing the same via curl.
Here is a log of attempting to access https://github.com:
PROXY_LIST = {
    'http':'http://myproxy:80' ,
    'https':'http://myproxy:80'
}
connection = requests.get('https://github.com',proxies=PROXY_LIST)
print connection.content
Outputs:
<html>
<head><title>400 The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>400 Bad Request</h1></center>
<center>The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.0.4</center>
</body>
</html>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
