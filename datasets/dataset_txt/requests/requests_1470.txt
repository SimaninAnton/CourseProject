Hi.
Following the documentation, I've set a tuple with connect and read timeouts:
data = self.session.post('https://...', 
           data=params, 
           headers=headers, 
           timeout=(4.5, 10),
           verify=False).json()
But what I've got is this:
Timeout value connect was (4.5, 10), but it must be an int or float.
As stated in the developer API under request method, timeout should accept float or tuple, right?
Thanks
