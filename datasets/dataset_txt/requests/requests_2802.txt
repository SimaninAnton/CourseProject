Hi,
I have problems with the "allow_redirects" to the Request object. It seems that if you specify "allow_redirects=False" it still follows redirects. I think I've found the source of the problem on line 169 in models.py:
while (
            ('location' in r.headers) and
            ((self.method in ('GET', 'HEAD')) or
            (r.status_code is 303) or
            (self.allow_redirects))
        ):
Shouldt the or (self.allow_redirects) be and (self.allow_redirects)?
