I don't know if this has already been discussed earlier.
What happens now
GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/USER_ID?fields=first_name,last_name,gender&access_token=PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
is done with the help using requests by
r = requests.get('https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/' + USER_ID, params={ 'fields': 'first_name,last_name,gender', 'access_token': PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN )})
Preferred way of doing it
r = requests.get('https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/' + USER_ID, params={ 'fields': [ 'first_name', 'last_name', 'gender'], 'access_token': PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN )})
I feel this will be a more pythonic way to do it if that is even a word. When I was working on it I found the existing solution not so user friendly. I would love to take this up and contribute.
