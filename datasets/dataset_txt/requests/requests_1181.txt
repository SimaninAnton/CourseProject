Hi, we noticed that urllib3-1.14 was released right at the end of 2015. Are there plans to release a new version of requests bundling that?
Downstream in Fedora we had a bug filed requesting urllib3-1.14, but with the way things stand now, we can't update to that until we have a matching requests release. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1295402
