Currently sending multipart data is supported by using files argument which is ugly from the API point of view and not obvious (see issue #190, SO question How to send a “multipart/form-data” with requests in python?.
I'd like to fix it. The following APIs come to mind:
Introducing new transfer_encoding parameter and encoding data according to it's value with fallback to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
Introducing new parameter multipart_data.
Respecting Transfer-Encoding header when sending data with fallback to application/x-www-form-urlencoded if this header is not set.
I like the first option the best. What do you think?
