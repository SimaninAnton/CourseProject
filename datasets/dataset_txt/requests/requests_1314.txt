I'm running into the following bug in pip:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py", line 780, in close
    self.sock.close()   # close it manually... there may be other refs
  File "/…/pip/pip/_vendor/requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py", line 213, in close
    return self.connection.shutdown()
  File "/…/OpenSSL/SSL.py", line 1522, in shutdown
  File "/…/OpenSSL/SSL.py", line 1178, in _raise_ssl_error

SysCallError: (32, 'EPIPE')
This is caused by a bug in urllib3; urllib3 has since patched the bug, but pip can't get the patch until requests upgrades their copy of urllib3.
