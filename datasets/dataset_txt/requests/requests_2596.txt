This worked in 9.1
requests.get('http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ming-general-sushi-%E6%98%8E%E5%B0%87%E5%A3%BD%E5%8F%B8/photos').status_code
And would give 200 as a status code. In 10.1 it doesn't work. I also tried to unquote it and utf-8 decode it and neither of those worked. I see that several unicode changes happened so it may just be that this was intentional but I am not sure how such a url should be provided then.
