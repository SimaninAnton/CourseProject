At my company we have recently migrated to 1.1.0, and I have to say it's been much more painful than I expected. Finding what has changed since 0.x has been a nightmare. I have not been able to find good documentation on exactly what has changed, and the commit messages are atrocious. I don't see a clear way to move forward short of reviewing the diff of every single commit, and that's too time consuming.
Please add a CHANGES.txt file to the project and religiously document every single API change, especially the backward-incompatible ones. I love requests, it's much better than the alternatives. But the instability of the API and lack of documentation is making it hard to upgrade. Providing a path forward for existing users is a critical feature.
