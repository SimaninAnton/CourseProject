I have to connect to a searching feature, amongst many other features, and I have so far been able to do it easily with one command with python requests.
However, when I use the search I need to send one parameter with +'s in it.
This person has this same issue...

But I feel it's a bit silly considering I am using requests so heavily here.
def send_message(command, payload = {}):
    command_version = {'offers': "2.1", 'categories': '1.0'}
    url = BASE_URL + "/" + command_version[command] + "/" + command
    headers = {"X-Apikey":API_KEY}
    return requests.get(url, params = payload, headers=headers)

send_message('offers', payload={'searchword':search_term, 'limit':page_size+1, 'offset':offset*page_size, "deleted":0}).json()['offers']
As you can see in calling the method, search_term will have text like this:
"one+2+three"
but the message is encoded as stated in the stackoverflow link I posted.
Is there a way I can stop the encoding of the + without having to create a new messaging system just for searches?
