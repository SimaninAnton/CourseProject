One test in requests-oauth is failing and I think is due to requests itself. It's this one:
https://github.com/maraujop/requests-oauth/blob/dev/tests/tests.py#L77
When passing parameters to a session, I'm getting a 411 Length Required error. I've sniffed the traffic and Content-Length is not in headers.
Cheers,
Miguel
