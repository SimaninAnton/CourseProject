Is there a way to cancel current request?
I'm testing a bunch of URLs that streams video, and I need to output to console the ones that aren't working.
I can catch the status_code but it's just returned once connection ended and data is received.
I can catch the code using a hook, but is there a way to kill the requests instance from the hook method?
