The following pages all link to http://www.git-legit.org/, which at the time of reporting returns a Turkish gambling spam page:
https://html.python-requests.org
https://2.python-requests.org
https://3.python-requests.org
Additionally, https://html.python-requests.org links to https://python-requests.org (note HTTPS), which returns an SSL_ERROR_INTERNAL_ERROR_ALERT error page in Firefox, and curl: (35) error:14004438:SSL routines:CONNECT_CR_SRVR_HELLO:tlsv1 alert internal error via cURL. See also #5138, where the Firefox error was mentioned.
