I've been using responses to test an application using matched URL parameters, which was encountering issues as the merge_setting function always returns an unordered dict (even though the dict_class argument defaults to OrderedDict). This means that I can't guarantee which order the URL parameters will be constructed in, so writing a test which responds to a particular URL is difficult.
I'm not sure that the dict_class argument was meant to be the class of object that is returned, but making it work that way would seem to make sense. As a workaround, I've set the session object's parameters to None, which causes merge_setting to return the request's parameters unmodified (which, in my case, are an OrderedDict).
