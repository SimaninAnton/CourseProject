I use requests pacakge to call nexmo api with post method: requests.post(url)
It has worked well for a month, but after my service is terminated and I check logging throw lastest row:
requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool - INFO - Starting new HTTPS connection (1): rest.nexmo.com
I catched exception but no errors are written to logging.
