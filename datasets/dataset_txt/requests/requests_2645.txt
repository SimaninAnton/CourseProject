here's what happens if you try to install requests in a Python environment that doesn't have SSL support:
Downloading/unpacking requests
  Downloading requests-0.8.4.tar.gz (52Kb): 52Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package requests
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 14, in <module>
      File "/usr/local/src/cogo/platform/systemfiles/analyst/home/config/build/requests/setup.py", line 6, in <module>
        import requests
      File "requests/__init__.py", line 27, in <module>
        from .models import Request, Response
      File "requests/models.py", line 19, in <module>
        from .packages import oreos
      File "requests/packages/__init__.py", line 3, in <module>
        from . import urllib3
      File "requests/packages/urllib3/__init__.py", line 16, in <module>
        from .connectionpool import (
      File "requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 11, in <module>
        from httplib import HTTPConnection, HTTPSConnection, HTTPException
    ImportError: cannot import name HTTPSConnection
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:

Command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1
not only is this very inconvenient, but it seems to contradict the assertion that requests has "zero dependencies".
