See #2244 for more context:
Specific concerns are:
Should redirects handled by the cache count against the max number of redirects? (e.g., if we set a max of 30 and find 2 redirects in the cache, the max number of redirects a user could encounter after that would be 28)
Should history be some-how generated by the redirect cache? (i.e., should we be making responses and adding them to the final response's history?)
Should a separate error be raised for the case where there's a loop in the cache? (When documented this would help the user realize they're stuck in a cached loop and that they may want to clear it to retry using the live site. Note: this also affects the API of Session#resolve_redirects.)
