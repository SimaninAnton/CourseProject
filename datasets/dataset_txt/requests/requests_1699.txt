This is what I get during a requests session under python 3.3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/.../python3.3/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 319, in _make_request
httplib_response = conn.getresponse(buffering=True)
TypeError: getresponse() got an unexpected keyword argument 'buffering'
