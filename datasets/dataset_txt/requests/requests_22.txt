Are the methods imported by requests.utils supposed to be public?
https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/eedd67462819f8dbf8c1c32e77f9070606605231/requests/utils.py
https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/eedd67462819f8dbf8c1c32e77f9070606605231/requests/compat.py
Is it okay to do
import requests.utils
requests.utils.urlparse(whatever)
in my code? If yes, shouldn't they be documented as if they were part of requests? Or at least the docs for them should be copy/pasted from the Python docs. I don't see them mentioned anywhere, just the three encoding-related methods https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/#requests.utils.get_encodings_from_content
Or should I always import these methods directly from urllib.parse import urlparse, etc.?
