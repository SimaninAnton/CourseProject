Hey everyone,
sorry for my intervention here, "out of the blue". I tried to understand if this issue was already discussed (but could find them) so I come here with the situation and trying to understand the solution.
The problem is the following (from what I understood) : Google App Engine, replace the implementation of urlfetch by their own, which contains some changes that breaks urllib3 and subsequently Requests.
@agfor made a fix that seems to work (I didn't had any ChunkedEncodingError since I place the patch on line) and, from my understanding, doesn't break the others users, those that don't use GAE.
I didn't saw his patch as submitted here (I'm wondering why) and I don't know why this hasn't been taken into consideration here. (Please note those are real question, not critics/remarks, my intentions are good :) ).
Hence my post :)
