When verifying SSL certificates, requests only uses information from the URL string passed to get(), and ignores the HTTP Host header (passed in with the optional headers argument). This causes a failure in my case because the URL I am using is actually a local IP address. (If I use the domain name, it resolves to the server's public IP, but I need to work with the local one.)
In other words, I expect
requests.get('https://192.168.X.X/' headers={'Host': 'example.com'})
to work as long as the certificate for 192.168.X.X matches example.com (or *.example.com). Instead, it throws an exception. Is this a bug that could be fixed, or is there some other way to accomplish this task that I am missing?
