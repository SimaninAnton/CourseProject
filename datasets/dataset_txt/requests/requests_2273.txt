s = requests.session()
with s:
    print s
This gives: AttributeError: 'Session' object has no attribute 'close'
I see in the code that it does self.close() but there is no such method.
My guess is that it is supposed to call something like:
for adapter in self.adapters.itervalues():
    adapter.close()
but i'm not sure about thread-safety of this approach...
