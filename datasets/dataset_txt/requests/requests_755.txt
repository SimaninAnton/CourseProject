Hi all
i have to open this link
http://www.mytest.com/rest?api_key=username:password
i do a post or a get call
host= "http://www.mytest.com/rest"
queryParams = {"api_key" : "{}:{}".format(username, password)}
requests.post(host, params=queryString)
and the server return 500 error, this is because the requests send that call
http://www.mytest.com/rest?api_key=username%3Apassword
and is not correct
have some solution?
thanks in advance for your help
