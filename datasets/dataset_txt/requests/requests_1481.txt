It would be great if the docstrings of (at least) the top level entry points (request, get, post, etc.) could define the return type in a sphinx compatible way (:rtype: http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#info-field-lists). This would make it easier to work with requests in various IDEs and code inspection tools.
