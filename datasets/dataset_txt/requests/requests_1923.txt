I had to write a wrapper to reqeust so that 503 Service Unavailable, if followed with Retry-After header to retry in given seconds. Can it be handled by the library by option?
Guess this is too abstract to be filed as an issue, because there are many other case you may wish to retry with an interval (unlike using requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter which retry immediately), especially when the target web service is protected by an anti-DDOS service. Should've discussed before filing, but mailling list seems to be down, emails to requests@librelist.org was not answered by any maillist bot.
