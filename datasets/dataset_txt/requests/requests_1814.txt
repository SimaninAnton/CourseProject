This seems known but timeout in the .get() function only works if the server doesn't respond. Is there a way to have this also apply to the entire request? (grab a MP3 stream, file too large, site is responding but is too slow?) I'm utilizing requests in an application that grabs only 1MB of each page via .iter_content() for detecting MIME but have some issues where sites are so entirely slow that grabbing the 1MB (or whatever the page is until it completes) can easily take >60s.
