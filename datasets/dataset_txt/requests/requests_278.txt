So as I was working on coding a notifier for a website, I came across an issue where my computer would gradually slow down after a long period of time. I thought it was nothing until my computer crashed. I then decided to look up on this issue by testing every single line of code in my while loop until i finally found out that it was caused by the requests module.
I decided to look up on google if anyone else has gotten an issue like this and I actually did manage to find a page with someone who had this exact same problem.
My code that I used to create this memory leak was this:
import requests

ListedItems = {}

while True:
 r = requests.get("urlToGet").json()
 time.sleep(1)
 for itm in r:
  print(itm)
 del r
I even tried to delete the r variable after I got everything I needed, but it still resulted in my computer to crash after a few hours. Please note that I need to have this program running for days.
