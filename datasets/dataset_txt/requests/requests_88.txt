Requests currently lists urllib3 1.24.1 as an acceptable dependency. Understanding that urllib3 1.25 support is in the pipeline, CVE-2019-11324 (Published just 4 days ago as of this submission) already has remediation in the incremental urllib3 version 1.24.2. This incremental change is likely to require minimal refactoring to support and would provide immediate remediation to a vulnerability listed as CVSS 7.5 (High).

An incremental version update to urllib3 1.24.2 should be regression tested and implemented, rather than waiting for 1.25.0 support. This 1.24.2 fix has minimal code changes and should be expected to work with minimal labor.
There is (of course) a non-zero chance that a regression could occur by forcing urllib3 >= 1.24.2 , but the ease of implementation vs the potential impact of not supporting this change feels like a clear choice for editing these two sections. (Listed below)
