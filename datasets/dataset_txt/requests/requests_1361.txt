Currently requests library supports a retry mechanism where you can specify how many retries to make untill it will fail, which is great unless you have a downtime of the service of only few seconds.
In order to make usage of requests more resilient to temporary errors we need an option to delay further retries, preferably using a fibonacci-like increase delay on sequential retries.
Example, start_delay=5 seconds and max_retries=10, would use these delays: 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65, 105, ...
I observed that lots of people are encountering the same issue and I do think that is much better to have this as part of requests and not having to hack our own httpadaptor to implement it.
I would go so far to say that I would even argue for having it enabled by default, when max_retries is specified.
