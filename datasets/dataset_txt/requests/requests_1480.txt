It took me a while to figure it out. Thought it might be a bug initially, I then came across #1791 & #1728.
Since this feature by design is quite confusing. I feel it deserves some more attention apart from simply mention it in the changelog (0b68037).
Can we have it as a tip/hint some where in the documentation (or quick start)? And suggest the proper way to prepare the persistent cookies.
