I would really like requests to support session key logging. Firefox and Chrome both support logging the symmetric session key used to encrypt TLS traffic. This makes it easy to analyze traffic with Wireshark.
Requests should write symmetric session keys to the file set in user variable “SSLKEYLOGFILE”.
