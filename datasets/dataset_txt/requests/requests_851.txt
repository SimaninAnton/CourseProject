Possibly just a previously quirkly behavior that intentionally no longer works.
For requests<2.12.2 having None for username and password still resulted in a BasicAuth authstr being created. Starting in 2.12.2 it will raise an exception.
  ...
  File "/blah/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/auth.py", line 38, in _basic_auth_str
    b64encode(b':'.join((username, password))).strip()
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, NoneType found
here's the change, (which certainly seems desirable), but caused our upstream (python-gitlab) to break.
