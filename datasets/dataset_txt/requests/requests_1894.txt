In the redirection code there are a couple of special rules for handling redirections:
4bceb31/requests/sessions.py#L127 shows handling of rfc2616 and some browser specific handling for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get
I understand why that is the default, but for writing code that talks to APIs this doesn't work.
Could we introduce a flag or something that we can set to be 'api_compatible' and do more predictable redirect handling?
