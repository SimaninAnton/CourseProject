On Python 2.6 on Solaris
Did a pip install requests, and simple example code produces:
the version is requests-2.12.3
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/www/htdocs/cgi-bin/scrapetest.py", line 7, in
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
File "/opt/csw/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/init.py", line 60, in

File "/opt/csw/lib/python2.6/site-packages/requests/packages/init.py", line 29, in
import urllib3
ImportError: No module named urllib3
Tried Un-install, re-install neither fixes it.
Tried installing urllib3 (urllib3-1.19.1) which produces a different traceback message:
