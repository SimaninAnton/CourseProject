Also affects Response.content which calls this utility method.
According to documentation, utils.get_unicode_from_response should check meta tags for additional charsets to try (presumably with get_encodings_from_content) before falling back to using unicode with errors="replace". However, the code seems to miss this step, rather the encoding is extracted from the headers, tried and then directly falls back to replacement.
