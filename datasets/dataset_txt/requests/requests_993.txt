Often when I'm debugging some HTTP thing, I poke at with curl. But of course in many cases when I interact with it for real, I am going to be talking to it with requests. Sometimes - especially in the case of weird SSL debugging - curl and requests will behave differently. It would be really handy if requests had at least partial emulation of the curl command-line options to enable me to just python -m requests https://example.com/ and see what it's doing independent of my code.
A really cool bonus feature here would be to print out the relevant Python code for making that same request, but I can see how that might be getting a little far out of scope.
