Previously, it was possible to set auth to something like (42,'password'). This has worked fine since before requests hit 1.0. 2.12.2, a patch release, broke this, causing failures such as the ones seen in this Travis build.
I am not saying the new behavior is incorrect, but this is a breaking change.
This is similar but not the same as #3750, #3736, and #3751.
