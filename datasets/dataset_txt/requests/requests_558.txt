Summary.
2.11 version introduced this change:
Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
reduce risk of header smuggling.
BUT, as per standard https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2 It whould be possible to have multiline headers.
f.ex. I need to attach a certificate via request header (currently I just mock the header validation method).
Expected Result
support multiline header.
Actual Result
requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader: Invalid return character or leading space in header: X-CERTIFICATE
This command is only available on Requests v2.16.4 and greater. Otherwise,
please provide some basic information about your system (Python version,
operating system, &c).
