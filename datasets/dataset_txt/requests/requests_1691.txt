Hi,
we encountered a strange problem where requests stops using the proxy.
if a http(s) connection to a server is not using keep-alive a new connection to that server is made per request. while the first connection uses the proxy well the second connection times out because it does not use the proxy anymore.
i figured out a fast-fix by re-evaluating the proxy object always. i just removed the line 209 in requests/adapters.py to always call proxy_from_url. this works for us.
if needed i could dive deeper into it to help to get more information if wanted.
regards,
michael
