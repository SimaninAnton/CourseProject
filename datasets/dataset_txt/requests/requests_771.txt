Hello!
Not sure this falls in the scope of requests, but nobody seems to have mentioned it so far so here it goes :)
I think it would be great to have an opt-in flag for requests that reads the HSTS preload list, and automatically switches to https if there's a match, just like a browser would.
This would save users from reimplementing this logic when they want to avoid useless http requests (they could already have known they would result in a redirect to https).
Additionally, it could be great to store HSTS headers from the server responses locally (just like a cookie jar?)
Thanks!
