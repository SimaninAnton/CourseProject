I have a (Puppet-)generated SSL-certificate with a CN and several SANs. A stripped output of openssl-output looks like this:
# openssl x509 -in cert.crt -text
Certificate:
    ...
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=Puppet CA: puppet.domain.com
        ...
        X509v3 extensions:
            ...
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:srv01.domain.com, DNS:srv02.domain.com, DNS:srv03.domain.com
        ...
Now when i use this certificate with requests, it always picks the CN to do the actual request. Meaning my remote always receives "puppet.domain.com" to verify the client-certificate against. Since the remote IS puppet.domain.com, and the client is srv01.domain.com, the verification always fails.
Is there any way, to have requests use any of the SANs to do its request?
Or is it my remote the actually only uses the CN to do verification?
