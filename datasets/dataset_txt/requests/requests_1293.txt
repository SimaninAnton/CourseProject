I did search long time try to figure out what is the root reason but still have no clue.
There is a simple script used Request to put information to https://dictation.nuancemobility.net, however, the script works on CentOS box but doesn't on Ubuntu ( both on ElementaryOS Freya which is based on Ubuntu 14.04 TLS and ElementaryOS Luna which is based on Ubuntu 12.02).
I have tried to use adapter, and got an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "LanguageIdentify.py", line 11, in 
    from APIclasses import speech2text
  File "speech2text.py", line 11, in 
    s.mount('https://dictation.nuancemobility.net/', SSLAdapter(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2))
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2'
I assumed the error caused by python ssl module on Ubuntu is without TLS 1.2 support, but when I ran test on CentOS box, it got:
python
\>>>import ssl
>>>'PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2' in dir(ssl)`
False
So above test informed me at least python ssl in not the root reason.
Some posts show the openssl on Debian/Ubuntu doesnt have default root CA certs configured. So I also tried to follow Certifi doc to import CA certs. But no clue how to operate the next step. I'v tried to follow Request doc that using REQUEST_CA_BUNDLE but also no help.
export REQUEST_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
Well, all methods I tried and failed on Ubuntu. It is appreciate if anybody can help.
