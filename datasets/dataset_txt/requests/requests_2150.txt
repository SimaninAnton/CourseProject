I noticed a couple of issues trying to get the errno attribute from an SSLError.
Firstly the errno attribute is accessed via err.message.message.errno, which is a little annoying but more annoyingly, for ConnectionError the attribute is accessed via err.message.reason.errno which is a problem as an except clause catching ConnectionErrors will also catch SSLError as it's a subclass, so they should really have the same interface.
Another issue I noticed is that the errno attribute for the an SSLError instance returns None
