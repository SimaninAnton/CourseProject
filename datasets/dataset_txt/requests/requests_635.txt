When using requests, I've just upgraded and I'm having the following error:
import requests as rq
File "C:\Users\_HOME_\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\requests\__init__.py", line 53, in <module>
major, minor, patch= urllib3_version
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 1)
