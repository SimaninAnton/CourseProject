Best I can tell, today there is no way to set a default timeout at the Session level. That is, I want to create a session and give it a default timeout which should be used on any request() for the session if no timeout is given on the actual **kwargs of the request invocation.
Example:
session = requests.Session()
session.default_timeout = 9
...
# default timeout of 9 is used
session.get('http://thehost/good-stuff') 

# passed value of 3 is used
session.get('http://thehost/good-stuff', timeout=3)
This would be very helpful for consumers wanting to pool request sessions above the requests lib layer using common kwargs for all requests in the session(s).
