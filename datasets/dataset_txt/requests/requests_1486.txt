Error: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'get'
When I use Pycharm Requests, error: "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'get'"
I modified file "requests\packages\urllib3\connection.py" in the 8-11 row
try: # Python 3
     from http.client import HTTPConnection as _HTTPConnection, HTTPException
except ImportError:
     from httplib import HTTPConnection as _HTTPConnection, HTTPException
To:
py   = sys.version_info
if py >= (3, 0, 0):
    from http.client import HTTPConnection as _HTTPConnection, HTTPException
else:
    from httplib import HTTPConnection as _HTTPConnection, HTTPException
It worked.
