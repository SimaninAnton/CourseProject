Three files in this search has links to <user/advanced.html#timeouts> which works good for documentation generated on the local machine.
But on the http://docs.python-requests.org/ there is no ".html" in pages urls so 404 Page not found is returned.
I think docs.python-requests.org will be ok if you change links to <user/advanced/#timeouts> but local machine documentation will be broken.
