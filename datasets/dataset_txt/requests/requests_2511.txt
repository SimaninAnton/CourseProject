Has any thought been put into proposing (via the guidelines of PEP2) requests as a standard module (please excuse me if I missed this discussion elsewhere. Hard to google for "python" and "requests" :)).
With full support for older versions of Python and Py3k, it seems like a good candidate. Interacting with HTTP is one of the biggest uses of Python and will likely to continue to become more important. requests is battle-tested, portable, extremely popular and actively developed. In this manner, it would be very similar to the inclusion of simplejson (as the json module) since 2.6.
