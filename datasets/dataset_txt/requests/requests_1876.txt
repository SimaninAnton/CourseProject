make_multipart overrides the Content-Disposition header (see https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/54ad646067a3e023fd4dcf40c0937ec46069871f/requests/packages/urllib3/fields.py#L165), even when explicitly set (using the new per-field headers feature).
Is there any reason why the code couldn't be updated to allow this header to be explicitly set when providing files as 4-tuples containing the filename, content, content type and content disposition? The reason for wanting this feature is to allow working with REST APIs that do it all wrong (can't name names, sorry).
