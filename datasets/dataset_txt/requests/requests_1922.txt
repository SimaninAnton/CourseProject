Currently Response.text documentation mentions that chardet module is used to auto-detect response encoding if the module is available. This should probably be revised, since apparently chardet is bundled with requests itself. It might also be sensible to mention that chardet is painfully slow, and to describe the proper recipe for getting response as text while avoiding chardet.
