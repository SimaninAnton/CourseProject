In iter_{content,lines}(), decode_unicode is a misnomer. It should just be decode: you don't really know you're decoding from a unicode encoding. Or maybe it should be text, to match response.text: if set, it guarantees you get strings back and not bytes.
Maybe this is irrelevant if this whole feature is getting kaiboshed, but in the meantime please consider making this more obvious.
