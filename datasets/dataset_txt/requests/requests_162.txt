Hi, I'm working on a python project, I use python3 with anaconda
I'm trying to execute a simple get request with this code:
import requests
proxies = {'http' : 'http://207.45.249.157',
'https': 'https://207.45.249.157'}
r = requests.get('http://www.google.com/', proxies=proxies)
and I get this error as a result:
ProxyError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='207.45.249.157', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: http://www.google.com/ (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x00000234AC984898>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10060]')))
I'm quite new to python, especialy to the requests module
Thanks
