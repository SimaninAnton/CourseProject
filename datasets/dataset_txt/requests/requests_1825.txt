It seems that latest requests (2.2.1) is also affected by bug:
OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_GET_RECORD', 'decryption failed or bad record mac')]
It seems to be an workaround here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21497591/urllib2-reading-https-url-failure but I don't know how to apply it to requests.
