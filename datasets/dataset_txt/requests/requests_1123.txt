python 2.7.11
requests installed from pip and up-to-date
URL -> 'http://archive.mid.ru/bdomp/zu_r.nsf/strawebeng!OpenView'
GET request hangs at read time.
I tried to use stream=True and then read from response.raw and it works. But doesn't finish on normal usage.
I looked at the headers and the Content-Length is duplicated.
When I try to read it from response.headers['Content-Length'] I find a single string: '133172, 133172'.
The length is correct otherwise.
I am not entirely sure of what's causing this but my guess is that requests is getting confused by the duplicate header.
thanks for everything
