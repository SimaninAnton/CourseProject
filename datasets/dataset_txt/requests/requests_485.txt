I'm transitively using Requests, by using locustio.
Basically, we're loadtesting a service that accepts file-uploads (pretty much just a vanilla POST request). We want to slow down the upload to resemble what a real user's bandwidth would look like. (For clarification, the machine that runs the test is high-powered to replicate a large number of users. This, however, has the trade off that a large file upload that a user normally performs takes seconds instead of minutes; which falsely tests the application we're hitting).
We're looking at systemically slowing the bandwidth of the machine itself to replicate what a user would see, but we want to know: is it possible to do this programmatically?
