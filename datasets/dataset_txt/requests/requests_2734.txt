Got a bug, where urllib2 set a "Content-type" header, even if the "Content-Type" was set.
    r = requests.post('http://example.com', headers={'Content-Type':'application/json'})
vs
    r = requests.post('http://example.com', headers={'Content-type':'application/json'})
Content-Type failed, because urllib2 has written it's own header ("Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"). I think it's a case (in)sensitive problem. Didn't have the time to look exactly into it, sorry.
The error occured with Python 2.7.2.
