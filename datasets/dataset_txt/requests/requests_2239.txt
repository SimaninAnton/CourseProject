After upgrading to 1.1.0, I now get this error when trying to pickle the Session object:
File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 397, in getstate
return dict((attr, getattr(self, attr, None)) for attr in self.attrs)
AttributeError: 'Session' object has no attribute 'attrs'
