Hi,
i need to send via PUT an octetstream/json element via put. requests is quoting the full string. Example:
    testdata = '[{"cid": "1","uuid": "sdasd"}]'        
    response = requests.put(requestUrl, auth=self.auth, json=testdata)
can be seen in Wireshare like this:
"[{"cid": "1","uuid": "sdasd"}]"
if i use POST it is unquoted.
My remote REST Interface is not able to handle the quoted strings. I wasn't able to find any option where i can turn of the quotation.
