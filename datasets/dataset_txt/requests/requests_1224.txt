I've seen a lot of code on stackoverflow that guards the loop-body with an if chunk: when using iter_content. Is this really necessary, I don't see it anywhere in the documentation.
If it is, could we fix it? Or if not, document it.
for chunk in r.iter_content():
  if chunk: # <- why this?
    output.write(chunk)
