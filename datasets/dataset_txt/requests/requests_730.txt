requests.post(url, json=payload) always transforms non-ascii chars in the forms of unicode escape , i.e., \uXXXX since the parameter ensure_ascii injson.dump() is True in default. It is inconvenient for global/non-ascii users, since the receiver have to de-escape it again. It will be better if requests can optionally prevent unicode escape in json. Any ideas?
