How can I pin a downloaded .pem TLS cert file for a specific server directly (self-signed certificate), without using CA roots?
Is this currently possible? If yes, can you please provide an example?
I read http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verificationbut am not sure if this applies to what I'm trying to do:
You can also specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both fileâ€™s path: requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', cert=('/path/server.crt', '/path/key')) Response [200]
