At the very least, it should subclass StandardError so that it can easily be caught without mentioning specifically or catching Exception (which is bad practice).
All of its subclasses except for maybe URLRequired are clearly runtime errors, rather than coding errors. URLRequired should possibly subclass ValueError, although it may not be worth making it different to the other RequestExceptions
