I'm using requests writing a program and it added the following header to my custom header:
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
My custom header is:
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Shockwave Flash",
    "Accept": "text/*",
    "Connection": "Keep-Alive",
    "Pragma": "no-cache",
    "Host": "upload.youku.com"
}
Is it possible to disable the added header at all?
