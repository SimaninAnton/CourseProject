Summary.
Hooks aren't called on each retry, only at the end of retrying
requests==2.18.4
requests-oauthlib==0.8.0
Is this intended functionality, how do I get a hook called on each retry? Here is my code
retries = Retry(total=2,
                backoff_factor=0.1,
                status_forcelist=[404],
                raise_on_status=False
                )

self.gbdx_connection.mount(self.root_url, HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))

self.gbdx_connection.hooks['response'].append(refresh_token)
