Good day,
We use your lib for testing S3 protocol, and found minor issue with HTTP headers:
some of header parameters, such as Content-Length, were override by sessions.prepare_request()
is it possible to add logic not to do this (smth like if request.headers['Content-Length']: p.headers['Content-Length'] = request.headers['Content-Length']) if header value is provided.
Thank You
