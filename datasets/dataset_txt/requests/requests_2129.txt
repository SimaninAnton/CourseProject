The params argument refers to GET query string parameters and the data argument refers to POST parameters. However it's my experience that these two are easily mixed up.
See for example:
http://forum.twilio.com/twilio/topics/python_requests_lib_from_phone_number_is_required - The user believes he's sending the data in the post body, but instead he's attaching it to the URL as query parameters.
Or here:
kevinburke/twilio-jsonapi@db30eea
where I assumed incorrectly that data=data would add query params to a GET but form values to a POST.
It's certainly legitimate to make a POST request with query parameters. It's unlikely though.
The reverse case seems like it's always a problem - attaching form values to a GET request, and it may be nice to warn in this case.
