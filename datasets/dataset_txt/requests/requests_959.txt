For kicks I decided to order my headers. According to the directions http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/ here I just constructed a OrderedDict and set the session.headers value to it. Now when I use the session for requests e.g. session.get("site", headers={"Referer": "test"}) and try to add a new header is doesn't take. Only if the header value already exists can it be overriden. According to the documentation it should be merged.
