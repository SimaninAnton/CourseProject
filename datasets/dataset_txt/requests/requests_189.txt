Hello,
In my efforts to start contributing to the requests codebase, I've run into an issue with one of the test.
This issue seems to relate to #3732 in some way but I've had no luck in tracing down the exact culprit.
The two items that stand out to me are:
pytest-httpbin server hit an exception serving request: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_UNKNOWN_CA] tlsv1 alert unknown ca (_ssl.c:661)
attempting to ignore so the rest of the tests can run
and
Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'>
Steps to reproduce against my current configuration:
I'm executing these test by tying in "Pytest" in the requests directory.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
