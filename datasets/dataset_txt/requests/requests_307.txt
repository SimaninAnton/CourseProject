Summary
Add a method onto requests so a default json decoder and encoder can be given when calling json.dumps and json.loads()
Details
Unlike #4097, what I ask here is a way of setting such encoder and decoder which is used in all requests and not just only on an individual one. The basic idea is the same except this is meant to be a global setting and not a by-request setting.
In my application's situation, it would mean saving many lines of code and it would also mean more abstraction.
Such option would allow having this setup in a dependency where the rest of the application knowing a new class have had a way of being encoded/decoded.
Would a global setting be justifiable? Or same stance?
