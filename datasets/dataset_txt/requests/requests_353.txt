Since version 2.12.3, there have been a bunch of awesome changes done to requests till v 2.18.4.
But, 1 thing that has changed considerably is that the cacert.pem that used to come packaged with 2.12.3 is not available now. Hence, the alternate option is to use certifi.where() to find the cacert.pem.
But, a lot of libraries were written based on 2.12.3 and not all of them have caught up to the changes made till 2.184, especially finding the right cacert.pem leading to this error -
 IOError: Could not find a suitable TLS CA certificate bundle, invalid path: /<path>/virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cacert.pem
One way to get around this problem is to fix those libraries. Few (but not all) examples -
https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce/
https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract
This also means all those libraries should be fixed/upgraded to using the latest version of requests. simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce#228 is an attempt in that direction. But, this may not be scalable.
But, is it somehow possible to make the libraries using the older versions of requests agnostic of the changes to requests. Something like backward compatibility. This will greatly help people using those libraries.
What does the contributor community think of this ? Maybe there could be better ways of solving backward compatibility ?
Thanks !
