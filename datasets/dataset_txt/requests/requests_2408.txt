I'm having an issue with ssl verification.
    >>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://myserver.tld', cert='/home/cg/cacert.pem')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py", line 63, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)

    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)

    raise SSLError(e)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 336265225] _ssl.c:351: error:140B0009:SSL routines:SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file:PEM lib
but the cacert.pem file does not seem to be the problem, as it works fine with curl?
% curl --cacert /home/cg/cacert.pem https:/myvserver.tld
It works!
Does anyone know what the issue here is?
