I have a web indexer that came across this url:
url = 'http://voxsc1.somafm.com:8500/'
Requests does not like this (2.3, 2.4.3)
import requests
r = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
this causes python to just hang.
from what I can tell, this url will somehow render/redirect on a modern browser.
the first bit of data are :
ICY 200 OK
icy-notice1:
This stream requires Winamp

icy-notice2:SHOUTcast Distributed Network Audio Server/Linux v1.9.5

icy-name:Ill Street Lounge: Classic bachelor pad, playful exotica and vintage music of tomorrow. [SomaFM]
icy-genre:Exotica Lounge
icy-url:http://somafm.com
content-type:audio/mpeg
icy-pub:1
icy-br:128
curl -I will give an error
curl will show a data stream
it would be nice if requests could detect urls like this and just stop.
