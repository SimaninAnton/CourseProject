Trying to post an API call to voeis.msu.montana.edu, a hydrology data management site running on https. Script works fine on my MacBookPro (v 10.8.2)... but fails miserably on Windows 7 (two different machines):
\requests\adapters.py", line 331, in send raise SSLError(e)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
I am pretty sure I was having the same issue when I was trying to use poster and urllib2 for the same purpose.
