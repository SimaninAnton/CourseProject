I have a question regarding caching of ssl certificates. I switched over to a sha2 certificate which has 2 intermediate certificates. This all works fine and requests is working like expected.
The problem is the size of the certificates. It was a 2KB certificate before, but now with the 2 intermediate certificates in there it's at 7KB. This doesn't seem like much, but the server I'm running it on has over 25million requests each day. With the content send per requests well below 10KB. Practically doubling my traffic by just adding the new certificate.
I tried searching on how the certificate are used. Is it a 1 time thing and then cached on the client side?, is the certificated send with each request? etc. But I keep finding the basics of how and what certificates do.
Could you tell me how requests uses the certificate and if there is a way on somehow caching it in the session object for example. Making sure it doesn't get requested with each call.
Maybe I'm asking something weird here, so please let me know if it just "how http works" ;)
