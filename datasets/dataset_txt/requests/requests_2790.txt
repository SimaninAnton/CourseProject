I've got a private repo here on github. I want to suck down all the issues. This works in curl (password removed):
$ curl -u "mw44118:XXXXXXXX" https://api.github.com/repos/spothero/SpotHero-Splash-Page/issues
{ 
... real data here
}
And this is what happens when I don't include the -u authentication stuff:
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/spothero/SpotHero-Splash-Page/issues
{ 
  "message": "Not Found"
}
Then I tried the same thing with requests (again XXXXXX ain't really my password):
>>> requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/spothero/SpotHero-Splash-Page/issues', auth=('mw44118', 'XXXXXXXX'))
<Response [404]>
I wondered if maybe you don't actually send the auth stuff unless the server replies with a 403, and since github is replying with a 404, the requests code never knows to send the credentials.
I tried reading through the requests code, but didn't see anything that supported that guess.
