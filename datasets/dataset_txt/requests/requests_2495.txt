The cookies member of the Response and Session objects is no longer a dict, it's a RequestsCookieJar that behaves like a dict in some cases. However:
You can't take dict(resp.cookies), since iteration over a CookieJar gives you the Cookie objects, which are not valid keys for the dict interface (it expects string keynames). Even if we added this, the dict cast would map Cookie objects to string values, which would be weird and not very useful.
In general, CookieJars are quite awkward to work with. In test cases I found myself writing list(resp.cookies)[0] a lot. I'm not sure what the ideal way to work with them would be.
