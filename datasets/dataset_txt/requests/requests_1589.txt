I've searched high and low, but no luck on this one.
running Mac OS X Yosemite with Python 2.7.8 and Requests 2.4.3
even a simple requests.get in command line to google.com takes 75 seconds to complete.
r = requests.get('http://www.google.com')
r.elapsed
datetime.timedelta(0, 75, 269509)
what's the deal? any thoughts? no matter what url, they all take forever to return.
