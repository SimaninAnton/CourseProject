When submitting a PROPFIND request using requests, and the server redirects using 301, the request is resubmitted at the new URL without request payload, but with the same method (so not changing to GET). I am not sure if this behavior is intended. You appear to have a few pull requests to match browser behavior in certain situations, but I didn't check whether those PRs have been reverted in the meantime or not. I also couldn't find any documentation about redirect behavior.
