As raised here:

Although your documentation states:
"The dictionary is special, though: itâ€™s made just for HTTP headers. According to RFC 2616 , HTTP Headers are case-insensitive"
It should be noted that many web servers do not conform to this standard, and enforcing it makes some requests break.
Therefore, I'd like to request a patch on this library which allows the user to disable the automatic header capitalization (i.e. just keep the headers as it received them).
