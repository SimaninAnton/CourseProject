Hi,
requests 0.8 breaks requests-oauth. See the related issue in requests-oauth:
maraujop/requests-oauth#5
After debugging both together, I've found out the culprit is this line:
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/develop/requests/sessions.py#L190
Cookies were not updated automatically in sessions before 0.8. If I add self.cookies = {} before sending the request, requests-oauth starts working again.
Not sure if this is a bug or you want me to set cookies to an empty dictionary in my hook.
Cheers,
Miguel
