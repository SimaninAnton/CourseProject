I recently tried to make a connection to a https url via a http proxy which doesn't support the 'connect' method (Crawlera http://scrapinghub.com/faq#https).
I'm using the following code:
import requests
proxies = {"http": "http://USER:PASS@paygo.crawlera.com:8010/",
{"https:": "http://USER:PASS@paygo.crawlera.com:8010/"}
requests.get("https://wikipedia.org", proxies=proxies)
will result in
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 55, in get
return request('get', url, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 44, in request
return session.request(method=method, url=url, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 456, in request
resp = self.send(prep, *_send_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 559, in send
r = adapter.send(request, *_kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 378, in send
raise ProxyError(e)
Is there anything to do about that?
