You are using pip version 7.1.2, however version 8.1.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
# python --version
Python 3.2.6
This breaks dependencies for our clients. Could you please make it so 2.11.0 either works properly with python 3.2, or alternatively, make it so it is not installable in Python 3.2?
