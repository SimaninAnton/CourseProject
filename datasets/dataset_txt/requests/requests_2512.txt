When using digest authentication with a wrong password, requests will retry the request for infinity.
This code snippet will run forever:
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
requests.get('http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/passwd', auth=HTTPDigestAuth('user', 'incorrect'))
