braintree/braintree_python#53 originally reported the issue. It's due to using requests 2.6.1+, which pulled in a version of urllib3 including f21c2a2b73e4256ba2787f8470dbee6872987d2d, which causes the problem.
I am able to reproduce using app engine development mode when switching https://github.com/agfor/braintree-python-appengine to use requests 2.6.1+ and un-commenting out the development mode enabling code in main.py.
