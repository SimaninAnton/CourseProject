When running the following code....
response = requests.get(result, timeout=10)
Where result was http://63.224.204.109:8085/browse/category/allbooks, the following exception was thrown after hanging for a few minutes (and apparently disregarding the timeout argument?):
Traceback (most recent call last):

Shouldn't this be caught by Requests, and passed on as a RequestException instead?
