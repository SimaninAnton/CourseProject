I'm trying to get the strict-transport-security header in python3 with requests.
My code looks like the following:
import requests r = requests.get("https://%s" % domain") print (r.headers)
My problem is that the strict-transport-security header does not contain all data. The real Header looks like max-age=31536010; includeSubDomains; preload, but the header by r.headers['strict-transport-security'] only contains max-age=31536010; includeSubDomains, not the preload which is needed by my application.
Tested on FreeBSD 11.0 and Mint Rosa and Arch 4.8.13
