Any idea if it would be possible to use something like oscrypto instead of the bundled SSL lib for HTTPS?
I need to use this in a Sublime Text 3 plugin where the bundled version of SSL is pretty old and I can't connect to some hosts supporting only TLS1.2. Using the above should fix this issue.
Any idea how this can be used for SSL?
