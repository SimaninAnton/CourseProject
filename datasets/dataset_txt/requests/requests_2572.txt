I have a project using requests for a while on version 0.9.1. After pip installing the new 0.10.2 version in my virtualenv, a post request using HTTP digest auth is failng with request.content == None.
def create(self, **kwargs):
    r = request.post(uri,
                           auth=HTTPDigestAuth(username, password),
                           headers={'host': host,
                                    'content-type': 'application/json'
                                },
                           data=json.dumps(kwargs))
I believe this is a regression as simply pip installing 0.9.1 causes the code to work unchanged.
