I have a problem about proxies, when I was using ip agent
requests.get('http://1212.ip138.com/ic.asp', headers=headers,proxies=pro, timeout=9)
How can i know if I succeed to use the ip agent, sometimes the result from the url is my own ip instead of the ip in proxies.Does that means the ip in proxies is useless?
Thx for your reply.
