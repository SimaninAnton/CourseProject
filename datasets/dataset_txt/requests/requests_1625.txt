Should requests supports the "ANY" authentication method for http authentication?
PHP curl supports this method: http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php (please search for CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH).
This method will support http authentication for both Basic and Digest. It will send the header with Basic first, and try for Digest if the server requests for Digest.
Because requests is for human, normally the client should not care about Basic or Digest.
What do you think?
