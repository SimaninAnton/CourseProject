i am facing requests.exceptions.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661) issue.
i am using python
v2.7.13
, requests
v2.7.0.
my service is started with https using bottle-paste. i have created certificates using openssl. for server-side i am using .pem and from client-side i am using .pkcs12.
and my service using OpenSSL . i am using sslcontext to start service SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv23_METHOD).
and as you guys know requests module using ssl.
same service can hit from java , postman with using client certificates( .pkcs12 ). not sure why is it failing here ? can any one help me here ??
