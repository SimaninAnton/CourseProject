At work we have an in-house REST API that puts useful information in the text portion of the HTTP status line. I was surprised that this wasn't exposed on the Response object, and I had to go to response.raw.reason to get it.
My fork has a fix (btubbs@742c168). I think it's worth adding, but am interested in others' thoughts before making a pull request.
