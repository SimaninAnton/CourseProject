From Advanced Usage page (emphasis mine):
Keep-Alive
Excellent news â€” thanks to urllib3, keep-alive is 100% automatic within a session! Any requests that you make within a session will automatically reuse the appropriate connection!
Note that connections are only released back to the pool for reuse once all body data has been read; be sure to either set stream to False or read the content property of the Response object.
Could you please clarify if the connection would be released to the pool for reuse if the response is read though .json() method instead of the content property?
