Summary.
I was debugging a requests example from the website here (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and was in a PDB session. Went to inspect "r" by typing "r" and it did not reference the variable "r".
What you expected.
I expected that it would return the object R
What happened instead.
It returned to the next method, because PDB uses hotkeys.
import requests
r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
Then type 'r' in PDB session, will return instead of instance of 'r'.
Suggestion.
Update the docs to not use single-char variables. I would have sent a PR, but wanted to start here, as it's more emergent behavior of using PDB and single char vars then a direct requests issue, but is reflected in your examples.
