It appears to me that connection pooling plain doesn't work if you're connecting through a proxy.
In the Request.send method, when connecting through a proxy, instead of using the provided self._poolmanager object, it uses the static module-level function proxy_from_url. This instantiates a new connection pool for each request.
This is obviously partly an issue with urllib3, and it seems like this code is changed by the SOCKS proxy changes being considered for urllib3.
In the mean time it makes requests unusable for high-performance connections through a proxy.
