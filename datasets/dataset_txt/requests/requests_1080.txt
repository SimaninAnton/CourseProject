As of 2.10.0, I can set HTTP_PROXY=socks5://example.com:port, and then requests will use that SOCKS proxy. However, other tools (e.g. Docker) currently require the use of ALL_PROXY instead, and get confused if you set HTTP_PROXY to a URL that begins with socks5://. I think Docker should support the use of HTTP_PROXY, but requests should also support the use of ALL_PROXY, especially with the recent (thank you thank you thank you) addition of SOCKS support.
I thought that this might need to go through urllib3, but it seems like it would be a relatively simple change to sessions.py, to look at the 'all' key before checking the scheme. But, then I read your contributor's guide and thought it best to post an issue before just doing it. ðŸ˜„
