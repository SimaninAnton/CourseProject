I'm trying to use ipv6 proxy with requests but I can't
What I'm doing is :
import requests

resp = requests.get('https://instagram.com', proxies=dict(http='https://xxxxxx:xxxxxx@[2604:0180:2:99b:fc3d:a70b:a7f2:7a2a]:17684', https='https://xxxxxx:xxxxxx@[2604:0180:2:99b:fc3d:a70b:a7f2:7a2a]:17684'))
