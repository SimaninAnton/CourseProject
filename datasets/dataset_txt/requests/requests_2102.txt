While installing httpie, pip grabs requests as a dependency, and it should be grabbing the most recent version, but instead, I end up with v0.14.2, which is incompatible with httpie. Attempting to install from a mirror has the same result. Installing from source code works without issue, however.
Have Python 2.7.5 installed via Homebrew on OS X 10.8.3
