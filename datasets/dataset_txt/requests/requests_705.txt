We were using Requests with FileStack without issues until we ran into this URL format:
https://process.filestackapi.com/store=l:S3,p:"/watermarked/"/watermark=f:wUaFDoPfRAiT50LQZWs9,p:[bottom,right],s:63/p2aaZ8pzS8md1vLzY7V2
the p:[bottom,right] part seems to be causing issues (the request doesn't properly make it to their end). FileStack's documentation suggests using curl with the -g option:
-g, --globoff
This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to the URI standard.
https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html
Is there a similar option for Requests? I saw that it's not a valid URI, so I am also talking to FileStack to be able to resolve this but I am wondering if there is a temporary solution while I wait for them.
Looking at the response URL, it seems the quotes are encoded but not the brackets?
https://process.filestackapi.com/store=l:S3,p:%22/watermarked/%22/watermark=f:9shDBUAMSMm58i5r3Ujr,p:[bottom,right],s:17/uj16GiSQa2bzDCVY34vw
but the same happens in the p:center case which works just fine.
