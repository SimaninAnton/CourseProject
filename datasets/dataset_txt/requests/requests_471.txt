Summary.
When trying to simulate postBack messages in an ASP.NET system, I find that Requests quotes
spaces as '+', but the server seems to expect '%20'. I've ready quite a few posts on the 'net about this,
but no (more or less) elegant solution to solve this using Requests. I tried to convert quote the dict to a string 'manually' using requests.utils.quote, which works for the spaces, but this function does not quote '/', which seems to be expected by eg. __VIEWSTATE.
Expected Result
A possibility to specify POST operations with %20 quoting
Actual Result
POST is quoting with '+'
Reproduction Steps
s = requests.session()
...
testdata = {"name": "MARIA "}
    self.s.post(LAST_MOV,
                data = testdata)
...
Logged from wireshark:
(POST header mostly removed)
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
name=MARIA++++
