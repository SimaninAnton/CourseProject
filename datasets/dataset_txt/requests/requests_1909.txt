we do a post, passing the cookies from the previous response as the cookies:
requests.post(...,cookies=resp.cookies...)
the request function of the Session class appears to be presuming the cookies are always a dict, even though the comments indicate it could also be a cookiejar.
self.cookies = cookiejar_from_dict(cookies, cookiejar=self.cookies, overwrite=False)
the only way we can get it to work is if we use:
requests.post(...,cookies=resp.cookies.get_dict...)
Thanks
