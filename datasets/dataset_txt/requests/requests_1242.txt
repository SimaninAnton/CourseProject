Hello all. I'm using requests 2.8.1 as part of a Flask 0.10.1 installation with Python 3.4 on Windows 8.1, and getting the following traceback upon attempting to run my code:
File "c:\Python34\atweather\lib\site-packages\requests-2.8.1-py3.4.egg\requests\api.py", line 69, in get return request('get', url, params=params, **kwargs)
File "c:\Python34\atweather\lib\site-packages\requests-2.8.1-py3.4.egg\requests\api.py", line 50, in request response = session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
File "c:\Python34\atweather\lib\site-packages\requests-2.8.1-py3.4.egg\requests\sessions.py", line 468, in request resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)

File "c:\Python34\atweather\lib\site-packages\requests-2.8.1-py3.4.egg\requests\adapters.py", line 423, in send raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)

requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='proxy.server', port=3128): Max retries exceeded with url: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-84.2476&lat=34.5627&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=text&TextType=1 (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x036F3830>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed',)))
It's not an issue with the url that I'm passing in, as the url works fine when I enter it directly into a browser tab - and moreover the same issue crops up with any url, for instance http://google.com.
My website is very simple and I'm just attempting to run it locally to do some development on it. I'm fairly new to using Flask and web programming in general, so if this seems more like something that I'm doing wrong with my Flask environment, directory structure, etc. then I apologize. Nothing has really changed about my project since the last time I did local development on it except for the versions of various packages that Flask uses.
Also...I chopped off everything in the traceback prior to when it started throwing "requests" stuff at me, but if you think any of what I excluded could be helpful then let me know. Thank you.
