I am not sure if this is out of scope of requests, but I was wondering about the implementation of some sort of request time metric, as in the time it takes from the start to completion of the request.
For example:
resp = requests.get('https://github.com')
resp.time #(or something similar)
124ms # (Represented as ms/seconds etc, but actually returned as milliseconds within a time object or similar)
I am more then happy to get started on this, I would just like a discussion about the relevance of this feature to the context and purpose of requests as a package.
