This is related to a report for the Dropbox Python SDK.
The following hangs:
from StringIO import StringIO
s = StringIO()
s.write('hello')  # This is seeked to the end
requests.post('http://www.google.com', data=s)  # Hangs: A success would be a 405 error
After a cursory look, it looks like the request isn't fully formed so the server doesn't attempt to send a response which leaves the client hanging.
If we call s.seek(0), this works. A bit more counterintuitively, this also works:
requests.post('http://www.google.com', data=StringIO())
