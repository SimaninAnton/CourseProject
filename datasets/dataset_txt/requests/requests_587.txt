Currently, in the _compat.py module, if you have simplejson installed, it will use that over the standard built-in json.
This works fine in Python 2, since simplejson is typically faster than the built in json package, and it is more 'correct' in handling JSON.
However, in Python 3, simplejson is slower than the built in json package especially for smaller json payloads, which is probably a typical use case with the requests library. Even though simplejson handles various JSON strings better than the built in JSON, those cases are not typical.
I would like to see a hook that allows a user to opt to use a alternate JSON library so that a user can specify if they want to use rapidjson, ujson, simpleson for the response.json() decoding.
