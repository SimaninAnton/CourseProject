I don't think it's possible. But it would be nice.
Currently if:
you set your DNS resolvers to something that's not listening on port 53, eg 123.123.123.123
you try to make a request with a timeout
The request will use the system timeout, usually upwards of 2 minutes.
It would be nice to be able to attach a timeout to DNS lookups. Go attaches one for example by resolving DNS in a goroutine with a thread timeout.
