So I'm working with warc files. Warc files are a storage medium for saving and archiving websites, so they contain plenty (possibly thousands) of text HTTP request / response pairs. I need a way to parse these responses into usable objects.
Extracting the text of the HTTP response from the warc file is easy enough, but I can't find a decent python library that will convert that response text into a response object. About the best I can find is this:

which requires me to set up fake server connections using a really ugly library. As a work around it kinda works, but it would be nice to work with something a bit more human.
In my field the internet archive is growing in importance and I can see this issue coming up for more people than just me. It would be a nice feature to have.
