In requests, GET request need "params = request_body", but POST (or ohter) request need "data=request_body",
so
i think about is let the request data together.
i know HTTP BODY and URL params need a different handler, but we can let this handler in send_request function (means use URL or BODY).
and
it's there any "design pattern" about using "params" and "data" ?
thx.
