Using this code:
import requests
requests.get('https://github.com')
Throws the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 55, in get

requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname '<Proxy>' doesn't match either of 'github.com', 'www.github.com'
where is the URL of the http(s)-proxy I'm using. I have set the environment-variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY (lowercase, too) to that URL. Is it possible to avoid that error without appending verify=False so I don't have to mess with other projects?
