I'm trying to use a certificate with requests. I need to use a certificate to access internal services at work. I have installed it on chrome per example to access some internal sites.
With curl I can use it that way: curl -s --cacert /home/path/certificate.crt -u USER:PASSWORD https://server:8443/teste
With requests I can't make it work. I have already read some old closed issues without success. I also created a post on stack-overflow but I couldn't understand the answers I got on comments. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53340465/cant-use-a-crt-certificate
I use the command
r = requests.get('https://server:8443/teste', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('USER', 'PASSWORD'), verify='/home/path/certificate.crt')
with result:
requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='server', port=8443): Max retries exceeded with url: /teste (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, u'[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:590)'),))
Thank you
