I must add some headers to POST, and remove some headers to GET.
For example, if I do not use:
s.headers.update({'Content-Length':''})
s.headers.update({'Content-Type':''})
before the POST, it will not post correctly.
Also if I have Content-Type and Content-Length in my headers, GET will not work properly.
I'm manually adding and removing them all the time, I thought Requests did handle it automatically, doesn't it?
Also, there's a page that in order to get a response, you must have these in the headers:
s.headers.update({'If-Modified-Since':''})
s.headers.update({'If-None-Match':''})
If I do not add it manually, it returns 404.
