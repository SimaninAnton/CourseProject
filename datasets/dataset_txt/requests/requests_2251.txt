I am using Python Requests with Polipo, after I updated Requests to the latest version, when I do a get, rather than giving me the output of the content of the website, I get a page that is equivalent to performing a request to http://localhost:8123
Update 1:
Wireshark gives me the following output for the request header.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8123
Content-Length: 0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
Accept: /
