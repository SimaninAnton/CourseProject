It is traditional to include the public API in __init__.py.
Consider this test code:
import requests
import requests.exceptions

a = requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout
This will run properly, but PyCharm raises a warning, saying, "Cannot find reference 'exceptions' in __init__.py".
This could be fixed by changing an __init__.py line from:
from . import utils
to
from . import requests, utils
While this is technically a bug in PyCharm, requests' init.py already imports utils, apparently for this very purpose. So it would be consistent to import exceptions as well.
