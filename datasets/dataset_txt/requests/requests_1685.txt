Because of dict-like headers requests can loose one ore more cookies
(i.e. http://www.lineage2dex.com/):
Set-Cookie: __HFCTL=0; path=/
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=7c3129a98cc6a75e0cbf71b7a3513364; path=/
But in requests i have only one (the first).
I think the solution is to take othe data structure (like http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/datastructures/#werkzeug.datastructures.MultiDict from werkzeug) that will not break api, but can hadle this situation.
