We consume a lot of URL shorteners and redirects. Unlike many requests users, we care about the entire journey -- not just the destination. The current API makes it slightly inconvenient to iterate over the responses in order when needed.
I often end up using a function that does the following, and wanted to suggest handling this upstream with something like...
@property
def response_chain(self):
    '''iterate over the responses in order, from the original request to ultimate response'''
    if self.history:
        for response in self.history:
            yield response
    if self.response:
        yield self.response
