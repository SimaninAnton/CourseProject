I'm looking for a way to do a verify, but still continue with the actual request.
This way I can create a message, notifying the user, but returning the content.
See:
https://github.com/RuudBurger/CouchPotatoServer/issues/3357 or https://github.com/RuudBurger/CouchPotatoServer/issues/3369
If I check both
http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=torrentshack.net
http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=nzbs.in
They seem fine to me, but they fail using requests
There are also a lot of users using selfsigned urls, giving just a warning would be good enough here also.
I've tried creating my own adapter, extending the httpadapter, but then I have to do a requests and if that fails on SSLError, remove verify=true and do the request again. Seems a bit overkill to me.
Hope you can help me out.
