I think being able to return a description for HTTP status codes might be nice. Something you could print out along with the status code, in case you had to.
I'm thinking a use case as something along these lines:
r = requests.get(url, timeout=20)

if r.status_code != requests.codes.ok:
    return 'HTTP {code}: {desc}'.format(code=r.status_code,
            desc=requests.status_codes.description[r.status_code])
With something like this added to request_codes:
description = {
    # ...
    403: 'Access Denied',
    404: 'File Not Found',
    405: 'Method Not Allowed',
    406: 'Not Acceptable'
    # ...
}
And other descriptions mostly grabbed from Wikipedia.
I think it'd be a nice addition, especially if we could roll it into r, as r.status_description or something similar. I can write up some code and submit a PR, if you think this would go well in Requests.
And thanks for the awesome library. I dunno how I ever lived without Requests ðŸ˜„
