So I had a very long day debugging why I was getting
EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:590)
It turns out that init.py tried to monkey patch the ssl_wrap_socket
    from .packages.urllib3.contrib import pyopenssl
    pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
But it couldn't, since it couldn't import from .packages.urllib3.contrib import pyopenssl
Which due to packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py tried to import:
from ndg.httpsclient.ssl_peer_verification import SUBJ_ALT_NAME_SUPPORT
but ndg didn't exist.
Once I installed ndg-httpsclient then the error went away.
What I am wondering is why package ndg-httpsclient was not installed during installing requests? Or is it supposed to be installed individually?
