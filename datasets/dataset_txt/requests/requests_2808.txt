Sometimes when you make a GET request the client follows multiple redirections. It would be cool to keep track of the URL followed and the relative status code in variable like:
>>> import requests
>>>  r = requests.get('http://example.org/first_redir.php')
>>> r.chained_dir
[('/first_redir.php', 302), ('/second_redir.php', 301)]
