I think the requests is designed for keep high security. But when prototype use or trial use, that restrictions are pesty. Especially two errors below.
InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available
requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader: Invalid return character or leading space in header
I'll show the code below.
...
# [Pesty Case-1]
# This application-specific header includes spaces and marks,
# but the requests outputs 'requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader' error.
headers ={
    "Authorization" : " Basic q3io5yaFA="
}
# [Pesty Case-2]
# If you use 'verify=False' option, the requests outputs 'InsecurePlatformWarning' warning.
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)
...
I think supporting a option for suppressing them is benefit, like this.
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, disable_security_assertion=True)
#                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ like this!
What do you think?
