The specification for the OPTIONS method in RFC 2616, section 9.2 includes the following:
If the Request-URI is an asterisk (""), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the "" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).
Because the Requests API only uses full URLs, it is currently impossible to make an OPTIONS * request as described above.
