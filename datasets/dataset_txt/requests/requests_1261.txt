Based on http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585, looks like all the other status codes mentioned in that document are included except for 511. Any specific reason/concern?
I'd be happy to open a pull request with the following additional line if it looks reasonable to you.
511: ('network_authentication_required', 'network_auth', 'network_authentication'),
