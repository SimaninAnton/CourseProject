Hey !
As requests no longer uses 'requierements.txt' file to manage dependancies, I think we need to update MANIFEST.in to add 'Pipfile' and 'Pipfile.lock' instead of 'requirements.txt'.
Moreover, I've also noticed the 'NOTICE' file no longer exists too.
Expected Result
MANIFEST.in :
include README.rst LICENSE HISTORY.rst pytest.ini Pipfile Pipfile.lock
recursive-include tests *.py
Actual Result
MANIFEST.in :
include README.rst LICENSE NOTICE HISTORY.rst pytest.ini requirements.txt
recursive-include tests *.py
