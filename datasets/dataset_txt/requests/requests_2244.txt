Requests has a get_encodings_from_content() function, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere -- only get_encoding_from_headers() is used.
Any reason why? I'd think on most pages, trying for the meta tag encoding declaration first will produce better results. See The Verge, for one example (the meta tag declares encoding as utf-8, but Requests detects as ISO-8895-1).
