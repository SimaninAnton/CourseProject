Correct me if im wrong but its not able to fetch only small part of data instead whole file.
for example if i want to download large file and save to hdd, whole file have to be first buffered in ram:
open.write('large_file', 'wb').requests.get('http://large_file').content)
it should be like that:
file = open('large_file', 'wb')
connection = requests.get('http://large_file')
while True:
     buffer = connection.fetch(1024)   # fetch only 1024 B
     if not buffer:
          break
     file.write(buffer)
file.close()
