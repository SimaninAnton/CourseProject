I'm using Requests 2.2.1 and when I use an auth header like so:
    r = requests.post(URL,
        auth=("user", "pass"),
        data=json.dumps(data)
    )
    print r.request.body
...there is no data in the body. However, if I remove the auth header this snippet prints out all the data in the body.
