Summary.
I am trying to hit a third party API, such as api.ipify.org, which gives IP addresses and read the results.
Expected Result
JSON Response From URL i.e. ip address.
What you expected.
Actual Result
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=hostname, port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /myurl (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x10a857610>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known',))
What happened instead.
Reproduction Steps
import time

page = ''
while page == '':
    try:
        page = requests.get("https://api.ipify.org/")
    except:
        print("Connection refused by the server..")
        print("Let me sleep for 5 seconds")
        print("ZZzzzz...")
        time.sleep(100)
        print("Was a nice sleep, now let me continue...")
        continue
