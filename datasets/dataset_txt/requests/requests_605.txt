I would like to be able to get a cookie object out of the cookie jar by name and inspect its attributes (e.g. domain, expires, secure flag). My use case is a test script that ensures my webserver is configuring cookies properly.
I expect to have some kind of function like get that returns the whole cookie object, not just the value, but no function seems to exist.
Reproduction Steps
import requests
response = requests.get('http://google.com')
response.cookies.get('NID')  # Only returns cookie value
for c in response.cookies:
    print(c)  # c is entire cookie object
If this is a desired feature, I'd be happy to code it up myself. My suggestion is a simple get_cookie function, but am open to other ideas.
