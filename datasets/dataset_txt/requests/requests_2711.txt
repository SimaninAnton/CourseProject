The requests.delete() method does not support having a data parameter. The HTTP spec for DELETE does not give much guidance about whether this is allowed, but in practical situations, it is often used. There is currently no way to access such services using requests.
(In particular it's worth noting that curl -X DELETE -d "data" works without issue)
