Summary.
When I use requests to crawl a url ,the cmd always show me bad handshake,and after I refer other solution,it doesn't make sense.The real reason is that the module requests cann't support 3DES
Expected Result
The requests support 3DES algorithm.
Actual Result
For the url using 3DES,the requests module cann't work.
Reproduction Steps
import requests
response=requests.get("https://supply.zte.com.cn/UI/Web/Application/kxscm/kxsup_manager/Portal/index.aspx ")```

## System Information
Windows10 python3.6
This command is only available on Requests v2.16.4 and greater. Otherwise,
please provide some basic information about your system (Python version,
operating system, &c).
