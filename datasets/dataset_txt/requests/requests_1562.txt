As spending about 10 minutes figuring out how to log raw request/responses in requests, I eventually came across the following SO article, which references an obscure part of the documentation.
It would be nice if there was a clear section in the docs which explains how to do this, as it's not very clear and took quite a bit of searching. A quick copy/paste (or a complete move) would suffice. Thoughts?
