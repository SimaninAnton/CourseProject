I read your source a little bit and found socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout) in models.Request().
IMHO it's not a good idea to do this, because this is not thread safe. See also: http://kurtmckee.livejournal.com/32616.html
There exist timeout on several methods since Python v2.6
In my code i try to use the "new" timeout arguments and fall-back to socket.setdefaulttimeout() if it's intended:
