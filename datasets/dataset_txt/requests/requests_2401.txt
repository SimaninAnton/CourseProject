Content is immediately marked as consumed in 0.13.6, causing calls to e.g. response.iter_content() to throw an error.
Test code (tested with python 2.6):
import requests

r = requests.get('http://docs.python-requests.org/')
if r._content_consumed:
    print 'consumed'
else:
    print 'not consumed'
In 0.13.5 this prints:
not consumed
In 0.13.6 this prints:
consumed
