Does requests currently support Multipart-encoded files in PUT requests?
It seems that both
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file
and
https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uploading-data.html
only work with POST. For PUT requests, I keep getting error "413 Request Entity Too Large" from my Apache httpd.
Should that be considered a bug, improvement suggestion, or there is some fundamental limitation why PUT shouldn't upload large files? (yes, my GET would stream the huge file unmodified)
