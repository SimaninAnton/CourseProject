Hi I have the following data structure which needs to be sent to a web-service as form-urlencoded:
data = {'Properties': [{'key': 'KeyLength', 'value': '512'}], 'Category': 'keysets', 'Offset': '0', 'Limit': '100'}
I'm posting it like this:
req = requests.post('http://server1/ws1/api/data/filters/', data=data)
This is how it should look received after its been encoded and decoded:
Properties[0][key]=KeyLength&Properties[0][value]=768&Category=keysets&Offset=0&Limit=100
However it seems end up like this:
``
Category=keysets&Limit=100&Properties=[{'value': '512', 'key': 'KeyLength'}]&Offset=0
Here's how it looks in the chrome developer tools which works fine from the browser.

Can somebody please advise what I'm doing wrong.
