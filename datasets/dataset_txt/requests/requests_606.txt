As spotted in #4136 and elsewhere, the Windows Jenkins CI job is failing on master:
http://jenkins.kennethreitz.org:8080/job/requests/job/requests-windows/buildTimeTrend
...with:
j:\jenkins\workspace\requests\requests-windows>.env\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt 
Obtaining file:///J:/jenkins/workspace/requests/requests-windows (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    running egg_info
    ...
      File "j:\jenkins\workspace\requests\requests-windows\.env\lib\site-packages\setuptools\command\egg_info.py", line 470, in append
        if self._safe_path(path):
      File "j:\jenkins\workspace\requests\requests-windows\.env\lib\site-packages\setuptools\command\egg_info.py", line 503, in _safe_path
        if os.path.exists(u_path) or os.path.exists(utf8_path):
      File "j:\jenkins\workspace\requests\requests-windows\.env\lib\genericpath.py", line 26, in exists
        os.stat(path)
    TypeError: stat() argument 1 must be encoded string without null bytes, not unicode
In addition, the script that reports the result to GitHub appears to be broken, since the GitHub status for the windows job says "Epic Fail! No test results found.", rather than "Failed" or similar.
