The changes in 387c8f8 have broken the ability to pickle a Session object.
Possible solutions:
Re-implement RecentlyUsedContainer to not use threading locks
Do not attempt to pickle the session redirect cache (personally, I prefer this one)
Reasons this wasn't caught earlier:
Jenkins has magically stopped working
No one has been running the suite locally before merging/approving changes
