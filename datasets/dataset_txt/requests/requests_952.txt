For an IPv6 proxy address then proxies-dict is not working en ends with temporary nameresolving problems. Change of the addess to a name (name added with ipv6 address in /etc/hosts) the proxies-dict is working.
For IPv4 an address is working
proxies={"https":"http:[<ipv6:address>]:<portnumber>"} fails
proxies={"https":"http:[<proxyname>:<portnumber>"} succeeds (/etc/hosts entry: "<ipv6:address> <proxyname>"] 
proxies={"https":"http:[<ipv4.address>:<portnumber>"} succeeds
