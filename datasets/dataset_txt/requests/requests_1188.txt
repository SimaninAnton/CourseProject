Not sure if this is a bug from urllib3 or Requests, the problem is that there is an extra delay introduced for all subsequent requests other than the first one when reusing a session object.
The test are performed in Ubuntu 14 to a http server running on the localhost
with requests.Session() as session:
    session.get(url) # this takes <1ms
    session.get(url) # this takes around 40ms
    session.get(url) # this takes around 40ms
Similar case was observed in httplib2 with Python 2.6(https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=91), and was fixed in Python 2.7.
