When creating a session object, and setting proxies information, the proxy information is not used in subsequent requests:
SESS = requests.Session()
SESS.auth = (USER, PWD)
SESS.verify = False
SESS.proxies = {'https': None}
Expected Result
SESS.get(URL + '/' + ENDPOINT)
should bypass the proxy and be able to resolve the internal URL.
Actual Result
502: notresolvable for url
But passing the same proxy information to the get works:
SESS.get(URL + '/' + ENDPOINT, proxies={'https': None})
works as expected
Reproduction Steps
import requests
SESS = requests.Session()
SESS.auth = (USER, PWD)
SESS.verify = False
SESS.proxies = {'https': None}
System Information
requests 2.13.0
python 3.5.2
