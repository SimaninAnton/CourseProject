For the past month, all pull requests to master have been failing to build on AppVeyor.
From what I can tell, the build started failing sometime around March 8th.
Commit 8f3f022 may have fixed the issue in the 3.0 branch, but the fix does not seem to have been merged to master.
Expected Result
Pull requests should report a successful build.
Actual Result
All pull requests report a build status of failure.
Reproduction Steps
Submit a pull request to master.
Wait for AppVeyor to finish building
Check the build status.
