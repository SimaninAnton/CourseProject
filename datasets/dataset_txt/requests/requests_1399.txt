At https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/8b5e457b756b2ab4c02473f7a42c2e0201ecc7e9/requests/models.py#L664 the urllib3 ReadTimeoutError gets mapped to a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. It seems like the requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout would be a more obvious exception.
Is this just an oversight, or is there a reason for keeping it as ConnectionError?
