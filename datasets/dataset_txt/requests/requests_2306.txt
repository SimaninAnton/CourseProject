After the refactor is finished, we should take a look at the default Auth handlers. Right now their authentication information will be passed on a redirect, which is not forbidden by the spec, but is probably not the best default behaviour. We should probably be secure by default.
This behaviour should probably be optional, in case anyone relies on it.
This is related to and inspired by #627.
This should not be started until after #970, i.e. after v1.0.0.
