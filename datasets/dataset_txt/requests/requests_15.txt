When i import requests and run help(requests), Output is this:
ESCRIPTION
Requests HTTP Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
usage:

   >>> import requests
   >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
   >>> r.status_code
   200
   >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
   True
But when i try this 'Python is a programming language' in r.content, Output doesn't be True, It says
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
