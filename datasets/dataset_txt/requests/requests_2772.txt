Thank you for this great lib
parse_qs and then urlencode, things will changed.
the result of parse_qs if something like {'oauth': ['sig'], 'status': ['hanzi ok']}
urlencode can't handle list as dictionary value without doseq
My English is poor so I'll show you my code directly.
code and result
reallly appreciate for this great lib, it helps me a lot.
and I'm looking forward to oauth feature so I don't need to roll my own:)
