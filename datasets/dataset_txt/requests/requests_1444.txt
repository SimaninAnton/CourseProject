Hi,
I just inspect some test cases of your project, and find some test cases like
def test_prepare_unicode_url():
    p = PreparedRequest()
    p.prepare(
        method='GET',
        url=u('http://www.example.com/üniçø∂é'),
        hooks=[]
    )
    assert_copy(p, p.copy())
When I remove some parameters for calling the prepare method, it will raise exceptions(with url being missed) or traceback(with hooks being missed).
Is it unreasonable to provide None default parameter for some arguments cannot be None?
(A related PR is #2301).
Thanks.
