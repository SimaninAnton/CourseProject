r = requests.get("some api which results contents in json") type(r.content) => unicode.
r = requests.get("some api which results contents in json", return_format = 'json") type(r.content) => json
In current scenario request will return r,content in unicode format even though api results json or xml contents.
It will be easy for developer to mention return_type = 'json', so the request will convert unicode to json.
*Shortcoming: *
If the api returns xml and user specifies return_type: json it is tedious to convert. If like to like conversion is possible it will be cool feature.
