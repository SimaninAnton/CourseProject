for example:
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True, headers={"Host":"www.baidu.com"})
first response is:
302 with location: http://www.abc.com/index.html
then the followed request is also with the Host of www.baidu.com, for 302 location is a abs Request-URI, should not the request with the host of www.abc.com?
