The issue described here applies to both Boto and gtaylor/python-route53.
Basically, when running Boto or Route53 on GAE, the way in which Requests extends httplib doesn't work with Google's httplib, which uses urlfetch instead of self.sock/self.connect. (Assuming I understood everything correctly in my quick debugging.) This causes the connection, despite being created as an HTTPS connection, to be established as HTTP, which Amazon refuses.
