Hello,
Is there any way to get IP address of target host of a request? Looks like it's possible to get it from urllib3's HTTPResponse object with ._fp.fp._sock.getpeername() but I couldn't find how to get it working with requests.
Is there any easy way or work around for it? Or can you please add it to feature requests and to Response object as an attribute? It would be good to use it like
r = requests.get("http://blabla.com")
print r.ip_addr
Best Regards,
Sezgin
