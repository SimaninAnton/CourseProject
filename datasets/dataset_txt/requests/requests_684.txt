When using iter_lines with stream=True, and later trying to get the response.apparent_encoding, I get an exception as follows:
RuntimeError: The content for this response was already consumed
So my question is: Is this the proper behavior? I mean, shouldn't I be able to get the apparent_encoding even after consuming the content using stream=True?
I was thinking on running the chardet on the buffer result of consuming the iteration but I'm thinking that this beats the purpose since the result is already encoded.
Am I missing something?
Thanks.
