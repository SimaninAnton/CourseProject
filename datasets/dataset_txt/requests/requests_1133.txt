I've recently run into an issue where another library installed simple-json and because the requests library defaults to it if available, it caused all of our json requests to fail due to a decoding problem.
I'm unclear why requests even defaults to simple-json anymore. I'd be happy to contribute to a PR to make the json library for requests more controllable but wanted to submit an issue first. Or perhaps there is another way I'm unaware of that would allow more control over which json library requests will use.
