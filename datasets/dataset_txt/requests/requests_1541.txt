For HTTPS urls where Ceritifcate verification is required, I would like to use certificates/keys stored in NSS database(Mozilla NSS), There is python-nss module which provides the interface to access the NSS Database.
Is there a way i can use requests module to use python-nss. Any hints on how to achieve this would be helpful.
