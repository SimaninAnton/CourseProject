Requests version - 2.10.0
As soon as the working folder folder contains script with name "cgi.py" (it was part of my application), your package automatically executes it. In my case - I fixed that myself by renaming my script. For another users - probability of such case is not zero. (In my case it was about 1 hour of fighting with strange behavior of my application). To reproduce it, it is possible to create 2 simple scripts, e.g.:
test.py:
import requests
print "Hello from test"
cgi.py:
print "Hello from CGI!"
Possible solutions: to reflect such behavior in documentation or to fix it.
P.S. Very nice package, it saved me much more time this lost hour!
