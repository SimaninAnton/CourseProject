The documentation states that things like proxies, auth etc. can be set through the Session properties. That's fine, but leads to verbose code: Setting those properties when you have a kwargs dict requires a for loop and call to setattr() on each item.
Why not allow the following:
s = requests.Session(stream=True, proxies=myproxies)
or
s=requests.Session(**myhttp_config)
Am I missing something?
