Please bear with me as I'm quite new with Python and github in general.
I have been using requests to scrape data from the Play Store. I need to make a large amount of requests (about 20k). It works great for about 3000-4000 requests but gets stuck after that (SSL Error). I am not familiar with SSL and requests, so I don't know what causes this.
Error:

The-efi, on this github, seemed to have the same problem on this thread: #3006 (see below, he was not the OP) but I was not able to find the thread he opened for further assistance. I use Python 2.7. as well.
I have been stuck on this for quite a while now and I can't find any answer here nor StackOverflow (the answer was probably right under my nose but I've had trouble understanding them because of my lack of knowledge in SSL & requests).
Thank you in advance for your help, and sorry if something is unclear -- please let me know.
