Right now, it's not really possible to test things like secure cookies that aren't supported by httpbin.org. urllib3 has a "dummy server":
https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/dummyserver/server.py
that can be used to serve one-off canned responses from localhost --- providing full control over headers, body, etc. I wouldn't want to depend on tornado for this, so I'm not suggesting copying and pasting dummyserver, but do you think something similar would be useful?
