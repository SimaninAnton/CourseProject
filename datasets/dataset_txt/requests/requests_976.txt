With the release of requests 2.11.0 we're seeing errors where things were working with requests 2.10.0. The exception that's raised is "Invalid return character or leading space in header".
We can work around the problem and make sure we set headers without leading spaces, just making sure that this was the intention to have things that were working with 2.10 stop working with 2.11.
