Take this as an example:
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import requests 

proxies = {"http":"http://111.222.333.444:80"}
r = requests.get("https://www.google.com", proxies=proxies, timeout=5)
r.status_code
r.content 
Obviously, the proxies "111.222.333.444" is not correct, but why I still got status_code 200??
How can we check the proxies we used to send to server?
