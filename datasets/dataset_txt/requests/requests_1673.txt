Is requests timeout supposed to work with HTTPS proxies?
I know urllib2 does not support this: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/urllib2.html#proxies
"Note: Currently urllib2 does not support fetching of https locations through a proxy. However, this can be enabled by extending urllib2 as shown in the recipe [7]."
