partial code as follows:
header = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.131 Safari/537.36",
"Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8"
}
r = requests.get('https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-1999-0802',headers = header,verify = False)
When running this,I always meet such an error "HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nvd.nist.gov', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /vuln/detail/CVE-1999-0802 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016033BC9828>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10060] 由于连接方在一段时间后没有正确答复或连接的主机没有反应，连接尝试失败。'))
",which comes from <class 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'>. When i open this url in google,it is ok.But why i cant get right response when using requests in pycharm?I wish that someone could help me.Appreciate very much!
