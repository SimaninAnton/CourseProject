As of 1.9 of urllib3, the following warning appears once per invocation:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.4.0-py2.7.egg/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py:730: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html (This warning will only appear once by default.)
  InsecureRequestWarning)
When using verify=False would it be useful to also set requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()?
I understand that this is a design decision that not everyone might agree with. :)
