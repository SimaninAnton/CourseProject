Currently, the Session.resolve_redirects method requires a Response to be passed in, as well as a Request (the response's originating request). When using this method directly, this is a bit confusing, especially considering that the desired/required Request is an attribute of the obviously required Response.
There must have been some reason behind why I made this design decision, but I'm not seeing it currently.
