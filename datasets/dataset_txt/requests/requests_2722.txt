When response contains redirection, it fails to reencode correctly. For example, headers contain:
{'location': '/relative/uri/init.do;jsessionid=SOMEDATA!234567889?param=value'}
When redirecting, it becomes urlencoded, which is not correct, since results in 404:
https://example.com/relative/uri/init.do%3Bjsessionid%3DSOMEDATA%211234567889%3Fparam%value
