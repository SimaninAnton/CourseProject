The docs for Response.close say: "Closes the underlying file descriptor and releases the connection back to the pool.", and the code is: self.raw.release_conn().
I think this should be self.raw.close, as releasing the connection (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/826667a54c608d72d8813c3eddb75b27ab26c988/requests/packages/urllib3/response.py#L121) and closing the response's underlying file descriptor (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/826667a54c608d72d8813c3eddb75b27ab26c988/requests/packages/urllib3/response.py#L279) are different.
It's a little difficult making out all the implications, but I believe releasing the connection will close the connection when that connection is used again from the pool, which is different than the docs suggest.
