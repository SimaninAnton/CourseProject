Whenn subclassing the Session class like this:
class TubeQuery(Session):
def __init__(self):
    super(TubeQuery,self).__init__(params={'v':'2','key':devkey,"alt":"json"})
    self.server="http://gdata.youtube.com"
    self.key=devkey
and then using the session in a "with"-statement, the params are not passed anymore, since 0.13.8. Is this supposed to be like that?
with self as req:
reg.get(self.server+"foobar")
