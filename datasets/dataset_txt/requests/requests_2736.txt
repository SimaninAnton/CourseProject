About certificates and validation: it would be really great to have client-side certificate authentication. Submit a PKCS#12 identity and its associated password (if any) and let requests use it for authentication to a remote HTTPS site. This is the kind of thing you need more and more as some public APIs require strong authentication. pyCurl has it but it is a real pain to use.
