If http server returns Content-type: text/* without encoding, Response.text always decode it as 'ISO-8859-1' text.
It may be valid in RFC2616/3.7.1, but this is wrong in real life in 2013.
I made example page with chinese text:
http://lavr.github.io/python-emails/tests/requests/some-utf8-text.html
All browsers renders this page properly.
But reguests.get returns invalid text.
And here is simple test with that url:
