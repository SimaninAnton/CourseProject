Summary.
I was trying to install the library manually using the source file and found that certifi>=2017.4.17 was not mentioned in the setup.py
What you expected.
install_requires=[certifi>=2017.4.17]
What happened instead.
Processing dependencies for requests==2.22.0
Searching for certifi>=2017.4.17
Reading https://pypi.org/simple/certifi/

<paste here>
This command is only available on Requests v2.16.4 and greater. Otherwise,
please provide some basic information about your system (Python version,
