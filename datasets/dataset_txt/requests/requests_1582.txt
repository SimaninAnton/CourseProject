The definition of exec_ and reraise() methods from the six module seems to be the only thing that prevent using requests in IronPython.
The exact module is: requests.packages.urllib3.packages.six (around line 320)
The problem is that sys._getframe() is not available in IronPython.
As the exec_ method doesn't seem to be used in requests nor in urllib3, I've made a small monkey patch to correct it, but I don't know if I have to make a pull request here or in the repository of six.
The patch declares "reraise" at module level, like for Python 3, instead of doing so calling exec_.
