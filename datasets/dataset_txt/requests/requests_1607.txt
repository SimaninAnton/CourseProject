Hi
If I do a HTTP request resulting in a JSON, I can access it directly in Debian 7.6
    res = requests.get('url')
    res.json['member']
In fact, when I call it as a function as described in the docu, it throws an error:
     res.json()
     TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable
So, on my system res.json is always a parsed JSON (a dict), while on other systems this is not the case.
My Python an rquests version:
Python 3.2.3 (default, Feb 20 2013, 14:44:27)
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
requests==0.12.1
