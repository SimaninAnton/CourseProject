Requesting a subdomain from localhost does not work.
As you can see requesting a url without subdomain from localhost works. When adding a subdomain "[Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known" is raised.
import requests
requests.get('http://localhost:3000/highlights')
==> <Response [404]>

requests.get('http://api.localhost:3000/highlights')
==> Traceback (most recent call last):

Any ideas how to make this work?
