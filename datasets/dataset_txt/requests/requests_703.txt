Hi,
I encountered an issue when using the requests.get command with Python 3.5.1. I described the issue in this Stack Overflow post. The solution was to use Python 2.7.13, so I'm not 100% sure whether the issue is related to the base Python package or how the requests library works with the base packages, but I thought I would post the issue just in case.
Hope that helps!
