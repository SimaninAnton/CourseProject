I am contributing to a project that uses requests library (version 2.7.0) and even though the requests return outputs without any issue, I see the following warnings being printed:
/Users/ue/.virtualenvs/imgurpython/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.7.0-py2.7.egg/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:90: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.
Any help on how to fix this?
