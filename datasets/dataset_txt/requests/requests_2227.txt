It would be super cool if it were possible to plug a custom Request object over a Session object. However it looks as though the Request object is hardcoded into the request method, e.g. https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/1a87f15e6f8d22be6855424b46b80f66d178fe40/requests/sessions.py#L264
Any thoughts on this?
