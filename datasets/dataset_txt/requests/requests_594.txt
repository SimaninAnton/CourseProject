Summary.
For legacy (easy-install / buildout) installations the egg and / or source for requests 2.18.0 is not being pick up. Not sure if this an issue with pypi since the source is listed
e.g.
easy_install-2.7 -U requests==2.18.0
Searching for requests==2.18.0
Reading https://pypi.python.org/simple/requests/
No local packages or working download links found for requests==2.18.0
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('requests==2.18.0')
Thanks
