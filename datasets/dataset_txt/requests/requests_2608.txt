There's going to be new module test_requests_async with tests for requests.async module.
Should tests from current test_requests be somehow included in this new module so that each "standard" test would be run in async mode as well?
If so how to go about "reusing" these tests without coping them to the new test_requests_async (with changes needed due to the current difference between normal and async api - mainly the need to call map() in the latter case)?
Sample code in issue #383
