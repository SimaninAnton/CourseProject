It seems that this isn't always necessary, for example when I'm using pinned certs. I ran up against that issue trying to use https://github.com/kelproject/pykube and will have to use a proxy workaround. I'm using the IP address, not the hostname to contact the server per the prepackaged configuration file. I get the hostname '' doesn't match either of .... message.
