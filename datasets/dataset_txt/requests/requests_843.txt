It looks like there arenâ€™t any tests being run in CI against pull requests, so thereâ€™s a bit of extra work for reviewers to get the patch locally and run the tests themselves. And running tests locally is more susceptible to environment-specific test quirks.
It looks like there used to be CI on older pull requests from http://ci.kennethreitz.org, but that seems to be unresponsive now. ðŸ˜¢
Would you be interested in a patch that adds some config for Travis CI (and/or another CI service of your choice)?
