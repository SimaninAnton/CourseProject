Hi, I'm seeing this in my 'pip install' command:
Obtaining requests from git+git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git#egg=requests (from -r requirements.txt (line 19))
  Cloning git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git to ./env/src/requests
  Running setup.py egg_info for package requests
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 14, in <module>
      File "/var/local/maria/hudson/workspace/platform-api-console/env/src/requests/setup.py", line 6, in <module>
        import requests
      File "requests/__init__.py", line 53, in <module>
        from .models import Request, Response
      File "requests/models.py", line 37, in <module>
        from .compat import (
    ImportError: cannot import name chardet
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

Pinning to 8f86ff6 works around the issue.
