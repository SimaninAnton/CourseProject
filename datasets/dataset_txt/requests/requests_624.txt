As @Lukasa and I discussed at PyCon, twisted[tls], as it stands, would be a dependency of Requests for version 3.0.0.
I have major concerns for this, as I struggled a lot to get crypography to install properly on Linux this weekend.
We need to ensure that if we plan to to do this, before we put all the work in, that zero installation issues will be had by any of our users.
One of the reasons we are popular and well-loved is the fact that we have no installation pains, compared to some other libraries. I think we may need to contribute to cryptography (potentially by just making suggestions, or otherwise) in order for this to be a tenable plan for us.
Correct me, of course, if I'm unfounded in any of my concern @Lukasa.
Any thoughts?
