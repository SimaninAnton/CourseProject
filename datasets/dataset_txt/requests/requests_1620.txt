Reasoning
requests is an HTTP library, not an HTML library. Some of these utility functions are far more focused on HTML and a Response's body than on HTTP. With that said, they don't belong in requests proper. Instead they belong in a third-party library and currently the best place for that is requests-toolbelt.
Path to removal
Step 1:
Add DeprecationWarnings to all of these functions in the very next possible release of requests (either 2.4.3 or 2.5.0) (See PR #2309)
Step 2:
Prior to releasing 3.0, remove the following functions and migrate them to requests-toolbelt. Allow requests-toolbelt to release a version first and then release 3.0.
get_encodings_from_content
get_unicode_from_response
