hello,
I'm trying to install python-requests on my Debian Wheezy from the .deb:
gdebi python-requests_2.4.3-6_all.deb
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Building data structures... Done
Building data structures... Done
This package is uninstallable
Dependency is not satisfiable: python (>= 2.7.5-5~)
Well, is quite strange as with a "python -V" the output is: Python 2.7.7.
And I have already tried all of those chances: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install
Any idea?
