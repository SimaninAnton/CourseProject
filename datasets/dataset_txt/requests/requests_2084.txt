The balanced-python library uses a response event hook. The hook does not take kwargs, and under requests 1.1.0 this works fine, but under 1.2.3 this results in TypeError, wrapper() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'.
This change in behavior doesn't appear to be reflected in the event hook documentation.
Should hooks not require kwargs, or should the docs be updated?
