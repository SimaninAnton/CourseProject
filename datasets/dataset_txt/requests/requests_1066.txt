Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: 'Retry' object has no attribute 'raise_on_status'
You can reproduce this by changing line 140 of requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py to:
140         try:
141             raise SocketTimeout('')
142             conn = connection.create_connection(
143                 (self.host, self.port), self.timeout, **extra_kw)
144
145         except SocketTimeout as e:
This forces a SocketTimeout and causes the unhandled exception when calling Retry.new.
