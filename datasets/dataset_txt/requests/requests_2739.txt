I wonder if it's possible to build a form within the requests library.
I want to do that to implement the download in github api (python-github3).
Here is the doc for the api v3 download :
curl
-F "key=downloads/octocat/Hello-World/new_file.jpg"
-F "acl=public-read"
...
-F "file=@new_file.jpg"
https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/
Any advice on how to do that with the requests library ?
Bye
