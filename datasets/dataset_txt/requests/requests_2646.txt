Our application relies heavily on the caching support of httplib2. We cannot consider switching to requests until requests has basic caching support with pluggable storage backends (we use a BSDDB backend for a multi-process shared cache).
Glancing over the code, I did not see any cache support. Let's sprint on this some day. I maintain an http cache handler for urllib2 and I've also worked on the httplib2 code base (though I recognize that might be as much a detriment as a compliment ;).
