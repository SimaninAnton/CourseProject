Given that requests has now moved under @psf ownership (‚ù§Ô∏è), it'd be good to have some clarification around the project maintenance.
On the assumption that Kenneth is fully handing over management for the project, something that needs addressing is ensuring that whoever is on the maintenance team is empowered to take on the missing leadership role. I'd assume @nateprewitt is stepping into this (which would be great) but it's a bit ambiguous from the outside.
Who is the maintenance team for requests now? I guess the "Keepers of the Crystals" docs need updating?
I think the sidebar Twitter links and "Other Projects" can probably get dropped now that this is a PSF project?
The carbon ads, footer ads, and donate button probably aren't the right thing to have anymore? I'd love to see a requests sponsorship program, with sidebar ads helping fund the PSF, who could then in turn potentially handle a part-time maintenance contracts against requests. Probably needs a bit of thinking about. I'd be happy to be involved in helping setup the technical side of this, if required.
It's not clear what should happen to the "Requests III" call-out. The substantive work on supporting both async+sync in the same codebase, and of adding HTTP/2 support have all been in other projects. The httpx project is now a good chunk of the way towards meeting the design criteria of "Requests III". For the meantime I think it'd probably be reasonable for the callout to simply drop down to "Requests 2.x is officially in maintenance-mode only. This means we only respond to CVE-level tickets."?
I guess the footer could now read "A Kenneth Reitz Project, maintained by Python Software Foundation" or something similar?
Is there anything else the PSF / the maintenance team needs to provide guidance on at this point in time?
