Requests fails to handle the final 307 redirect at this URL. Instead of using the Location: supplied in the 307, it continually requests the previous location (until exceeding 30 redirects):
import requests
req = requests.get('http://ensembl.org/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/Location/View?r=II:5175-7175;contigviewbottom=das:http://foo.bar.com:4895/123abc/das/yeast_variants=normal')
print req.status_code
Uninstalling 2.0.0 and installing 1.2.3 fixes the problem.
It seems to be some kind of parsing issue. Removing the :// in the query string of the original URL (or URL encoding the : to %3A) also eliminates the redirect loop.
Note that 2.0.0 does properly handle the 301 and 302 replies also returned in that request; it's just the 307 that fails for some reason.
