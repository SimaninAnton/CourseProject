In #3682, @leth reported an error which I've just encountered:
$ python -m rwt requests -- -c "from requests.packages.urllib3.contrib import appengine as gaecontrib"
Collecting requests

    from urlparse import urljoin
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'urlparse'
Because the source of #3682 appears to be unrelated to this Python 3 only bug, I'm opening a new issue.
I have the same issue as leth, and requests_toolbelt is unusable due to this bug. I don't think I can wait for due time to pass. Should requests_toolbelt be trapping this exception?
