Currently logging in requests library is not properly documented.
The API Changes section of the documentation reminds about the removal of the config parameter but contains no code. See http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/?highlight=logging
import requests
import logging

# these two lines enable debugging at httplib level (requests->urllib3->httplib)
# you will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA.
# the only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.
import httplib
httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1

logging.basicConfig() # you need to initialize logging, otherwise you will not see anything from requests
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
requests_log = logging.getLogger("requests")
requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
requests_log.propagate = True

requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
So this means there are a few things to do:
#1 add the above piece of code to the documentation (including the API changes section)
#2 provide proper response on few stackoverflow questions related to requests logging
#3 find a way to allow extensive logging (logging BODY too)
