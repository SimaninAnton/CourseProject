I was trying to POST a request to a RESTful service and was having this issue:
The service is automatically redirecting all request from http to https
2013-10-24 14:16:54,190 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:_make_request:414 - "POST /api/v1/account/login HTTP/1.1" 301 0
2013-10-24 14:16:54,191 - INFO - connectionpool.py:_new_conn:695 - Starting new HTTPS connection (1): https://blah.com
2013-10-24 14:16:54,271 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:_make_request:374 - Setting read timeout to 7.5
2013-10-24 14:16:54,282 - DEBUG - connectionpool.py:_make_request:414 - "GET /api/v1/account/login HTTP/1.1" 405 0
After the redirect POST got converted into GET which fails this request. It doesn't seem like I got this issue in request 1.x
Any help?
