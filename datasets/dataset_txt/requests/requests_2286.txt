The OAuth1-wrapper included in requests doesn't include a parameter for oauth-parameter realm. I tried to add it as a regular post/get parameter but this leads to it being included in the base_string used to calculate the signature. This is not per spec.
The oauthlib.oauth1.rfc5849.Server excludes the realm parameter(even if received as a post/get parameter) so I get a signature mismatch.
