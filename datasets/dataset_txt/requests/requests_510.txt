code like this:
import requests
requests.request('get', 'http://10.192.74.230:6201/en?CSnaL/uZkQC9SLVbaMoQDA8Ph9/+Q7+stJc7S1qGSuvEss6zmYfB7SvYE4vAOWgfUrJuxOBk7giWoAKARD9o7oaZlmg84SgIEIvBgnqr3Jj9OH9RPt4MEbQmHmhsDfBfMzY2OA==')
expect return a response with status_code=301 and then will auto send to the new url in "Location" of 301 response.
actually requests.request() will not get a return value until after 120 seconds.and in wireshark log i can see the 301 response received immediatly.
