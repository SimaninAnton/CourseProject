Using requests, is there a way to send HTTPS requests while specifying the destination IP address?
E.g. github.com has multiple IP address. If I do a DNS lookup for github.com from Hong Kong, I get 192.30.255.113 and 192.30.255.112.
What if I want to send a HTTPS request to a specific github IP? This is useful for when you setup a service with multiple IPs and you want to test whether all IPs work correctly. Or when a service has regional DNS records and you want to send requests to a particular regional server.
I wish I could do something like:
import requests
response = requests.get('https://github.com/', server_ip='192.30.255.113')
SSL certificate verification needs to still work, of course.
