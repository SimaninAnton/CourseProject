Here is the code I'm using:
files = {'file': (upload_handle.upload_token.key, open("test.png", "rb"))}
resp = requests.post(url, files=files)
This raises the error:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x89 in position 140: invalid start byte
This problem is caused by the fact that the content-length header is actually a unicode object. When the actual body of the request is being constructed, python attempts to coerce the entire request into unicode resulting in the decode error.
After tracing it, the cause is the following lines:
requests/models.py:
self.prepare_content_length(body)
# -------
l = super_len(body)
self.headers['Content-Length'] = str(l)
where str = unicode is declared in compat.py
