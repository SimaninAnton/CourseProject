Some sites give a 401 error when encoding url parameters and body data with the default urlencode function, as they send + instead of %20 for encoding spaces.
An issue for this has been posted to urllib but as it doesn't seem to be nowhere near to be accepted. I propose that an additional parameter can be added to requests API to replicate that feature.
