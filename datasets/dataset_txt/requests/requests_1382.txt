Hi,
from time to time we this error:
File "/home/foo_esm_di226/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/api.py", line 49, in request
    response = session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
  File "/home/foo_esm_di226/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 461, in request
    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)
  File "/home/foo_esm_di226/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 573, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "/home/foo_esm_di226/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 415, in send
    raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)
ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine("''",))
This happens if the request library tries to connect during an Apache server restart.
I think it would be nice if the request library would retry if this happens.
But I guess you see it different.
Would you accept a patch which retries on an empty HTTP Status line?
