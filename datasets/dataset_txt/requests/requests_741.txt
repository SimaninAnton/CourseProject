The quickstart document (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) states that "If no timeout is specified explicitly, requests do not time out.". However, this is not correct as I noticed automatic timeout if no timeout is specified. Besides, this information is inconsistent with the advanced document (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#advanced), which states that "...by passing None as a timeout value and then retrieving a cup of coffee." in the end of the document.
