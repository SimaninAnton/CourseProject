when upload big file(bigger than server limit). I expect return response with 500 status
1、I tried postman to post api, it return 500 error,that what I need
2、I tried requests to post api
here is requests code:
with open('invalid_big_license', 'rb') as f:
    test = s.post(
        url,
        headers=headers,
        data=None,
        files={'file': ('invalid_big_license', f)},
        timeout=1200
    )
requests raise
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', OSError(41, 'Protocol wrong type for socket'))
what I need is response return with 500 status
if upload file is under server limit(like 1m),requests is success
