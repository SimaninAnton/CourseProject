When I try the following, the content returned in the response is still encoded. Is this an issue with the requests module?
result = requests.get('http://aceabio.com')
result.content:
'\xff\xfe<\x00!\x00D\x00O\x00C\x00T\x00Y\x00P\x00E\x00 \x00h\x00t\x00m\x00l\x00 \xx......./\x00h\x00t\x00m\x00l\x00>\x00'
