I'm trying to call a simple URL from a Debian stable server and I'm getting a certificate error:
import requests
r = requests.get('https://mobile.amber.io')
[..]
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
The certificate should be valid. I've tried all SSL online checks, it works on all platforms.
On my mac though it might be unrelated I'm getting SSL hosts don't match (there are a couple of hosts on that server with different certs).
