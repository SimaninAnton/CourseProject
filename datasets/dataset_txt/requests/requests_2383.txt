Reading from raw in 0.13.5 gives me the raw content, however in 0.13.6 and above I get an empty string.
In 0.13.5:
>>> requests.get('http://www.google.com').raw.read()
'...'  # the correct content
In 0.13.6:
>>> requests.get('http://www.google.com').raw.read()
''
I presume somewhere in requests raw is being mistakenly read from?
