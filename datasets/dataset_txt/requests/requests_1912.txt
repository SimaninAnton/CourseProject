As mentioned here.
The specific line of code in question is here. We're lowercasing the whole URL. This should be fine, but in practice there are clearly servers that will expect the Host header to match a specific case (because they're stupid).
We should fix this, especially as fixing it is so easy (we only want to lowercase the scheme) and doesn't hurt us at all.
