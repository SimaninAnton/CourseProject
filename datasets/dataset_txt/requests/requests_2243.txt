The commit 42b0295 removes the __attrs__ attribute of the Session class, which is used in the pickle protocol's __getstate__ method.
The tests that are testing this functionality (functions test_session_pickling and test_unpickled_session_requests in the once present tests/test_requests.py) are also removed.
The commit messages don't seem to indicate any reason for this, and I can't find anything searching in the issues.
If it is intended that pickling of Session objects not be supported, could you give the reason? And may be the __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods should be removed too, as they might send a wrong message.
If this is unintended (which is what I think is the case), I can work on a pull request to fix this. Please confirm.
Thank you.
