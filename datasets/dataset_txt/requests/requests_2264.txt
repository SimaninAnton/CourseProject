Hi,
It seems like that request.get always adds 'content-length' header to the request.
I think that the right behavior is not to add this header automatically in GET requests or add the possibility to not send it.
For example http://amazon.com returns 503 for every get request that contains 'content-length' header.
Thanks,
Oren
