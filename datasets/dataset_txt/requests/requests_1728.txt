For example:
    req = requests.post('https://'+self.server+'/'+method,
            data=json.dumps(kwargs),
            cert=self.certs,
            verify=self.verify,
            headers={'content-type': 'application/json' },
            dns=85.86.87.88
            )
This could be practical if requests are used (for example) in test suite which connects to more than one test environment, and each environment has its own DNS (code cannot rely on the DNS defined in the connection properities, /etc/hosts and so on.
At the moment connection must be patched at a lower level to achieve this, and in the end it takes less code when I use socket + ssl instead of requests (in the whole project).
I am aware that this use is not very, but it may be useful in the future.
