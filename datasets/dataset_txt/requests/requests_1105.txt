url = "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/subscribed_apps?access_token="+self.token
        data = {}
        if url:
            data['url'] = url
        result = requests.post(url, data)
Above code generating following error, even though schema is defined as in url. how to fix?
requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL '%sreally long string , facebook token':
No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http://%sreally long string , facebook token?
