The following hangs:
requests.get("https://nonexistant-1111111111.blib.us")
When one uses this url on chrome/firefox, they right away say its non existant or connection was reset. This is a https sni server.
Does this belong to a unit test?
Another related problem:
requests.get("https://register.blib.us", verify=False, timeout=3.0) -> SSLError
but both the following commands work fine (and get done within 5 seconds):
requests.get("https://register.blib.us", verify=False)
requests.get("https://register.blib.us")
Any ideas if we are doing something wrong here?
