The HTTPAdapter's initialisation code takes two optional parameters, pool_connections and pool_maxsize. The Session, however, doesn't ever use these when creating its HTTP adapters. It would be helpful to be able to influence these parameters when working with a session instead of relying on the DEFAULT_POOLSIZE value.
