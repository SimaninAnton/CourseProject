I discovered that if I force nginx to use only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 protocols, it will prevent the requests library from working.
Other browsers are able to deal with this, including CURL but request doesn't, at least when is used on OS X with Python 2.7
Reproduce, reconfigure webserver to use only recent SSL protocols:
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1;
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='example.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /some/url (Caused by <class 'socket.error'>: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer)
