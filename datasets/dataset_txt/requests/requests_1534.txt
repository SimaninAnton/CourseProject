raise_for_status() is super awesome, but a lot of the time, the error code and message is not informative enough to assist with debgugging when an exception is raised. It would be nice to have a verbose flag for raise_for_status that would also print the response body, where more details are often included. I would be happy to work on this, but wanted to make sure it is not already in the works.
