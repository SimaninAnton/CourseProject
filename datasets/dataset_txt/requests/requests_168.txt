In my work, I encountered such a problem:
Developers require the use of most compact json.
But when I use the requests module,
I found that the internal code used "body = complexjson.dumps (json)".
This is not flexible enough.
Especially when developers do not deal with such problems. (I am a tester)
So, can you add a parameter to deal with this kind of thing?
Looking forward to your reply.
