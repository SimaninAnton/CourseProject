I'm able to explictly close a response by calling response.close(), but as far as I could see, the only way to check if the response is closed or not is calling response.raw.closed. This feels like violating Demeter's Law, so I would suggest adding a response.closed attribute.
If you agree, I'd be happy to send a pull request with this change.
