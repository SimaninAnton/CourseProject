I have registered a 'response' hook with the Request in the __call__ method of my subclass of AuthBase as I need to check for API errors from my product and massage the output it returns for upstream consumption.
The hook logic is working fine but I have concerns about my approach:
Reading the Requests API section and playing around I found setting the Response _content with new data works. But I strongly suspect this is the wrong approach and it will come back to bite me. The Requests API lists content but in the hook logic I get the error: AttributeError: can't set attribute when I use that one.
Is there a correct way to change the Response content?
