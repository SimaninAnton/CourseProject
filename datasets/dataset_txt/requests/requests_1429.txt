Why is this that if I make a post request without a "/" at the end of the url I can't access the params with $_POST[] in php but the param is available in the $_REQUEST. Is there something that I am doing wrong?
Here is my code
import requests
# version1 - POST params are accessible 
payload = {"message": "my message here"}
r = requests.post("http://localhost/apps/myapp/", data=payload)
print r.text

# version2 - POST params not available
r = requests.post("http://localhost/apps/myapp", data=payload)
print r.text
