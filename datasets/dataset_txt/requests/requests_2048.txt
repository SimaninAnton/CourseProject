I am using the jenkinsapi module which uses requests under the hood. If I try to use it out of the box, pointing it at a jenkins server that uses SSL, I get:
SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
jenkinsapi doesn't provide a hook to set verify=False. I tried saving the certificate from the jenkins server and setting the REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE environment variable to point to it, and still got the same error. I also tried installing certifi but it makes no difference.
I know I could hack the jenkinsapi code but that is not satisfactory because all users of my code would have to do the same thing. Am I overlooking something?
