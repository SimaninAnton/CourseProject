With ac944b7 the maximum allowed version of urllib3 in setup.py was increased to 1.23.
However, in https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/__init__.py#L57-L63 the version is still required to be <= 1.22.
This is a bug since the release of requests 1.23 yesterday: https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/#history
Expected Result
Installation of requests via pip should work with urllib3 version 1.23
Actual Result
e.g.
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/__init__.py:80: RequestsDependencyWarning: urllib3 (1.23) or chardet (3.0.4) doesn't match a supported version!
  RequestsDependencyWarning)
ContextualVersionConflict: urllib3 1.23
Reproduction Steps
pip install urllib3==1.23
pip install requests
import requests
