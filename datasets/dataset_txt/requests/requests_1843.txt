In 3.4 the standard library's previously woeful ssl module is being vastly improved, and one of the nice things it is getting is support for Certificate Revocation Lists. I'd like us to investigate supporting CRLs in versions of Python where they are available. If we can do this, it'll continue the ongoing trend of Requests being the single most secure way to do HTTP in Python.
It's highly probable that this will need to be a two-pronged approach: urllib3 will probably want to support some genericised CRL options, with Requests pasting over the genericness with a built-in "correct" behaviour. For that reason, I want to start a discussion with the relevant people to work out how we can do this.
Requests people: @kennethreitz, @sigmavirus24
urllib3 people: @shazow
Our SSL guy: @t-8ch.
People who might be interested in either helping or providing insight and code review (to make sure we don't get this wrong) are @tiran (heavily involved with the standard library's ssl module) and @alex (currently on a big crypto kick). If either of you two are actually not interested that's totally fine. =)
Initial views: how should we split this work up, and how safe can Requests' defaults be?
