I'm following the quick start guide in:
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/
I got confused when reading the section "Custom Headers" because the example code features the data argument, which hasn't been introduced in the guide yet (it is the next section "More complicated POST requests" that describes the data argument).
My suggestion is to swap the order of those two sections, i.e. have "More complicated POST requests" before "Custom Headers", or modify the example code in "Custom Headers" (remove data argument).
