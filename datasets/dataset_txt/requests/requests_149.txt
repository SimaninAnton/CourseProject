This is not a software bug but a deployment bug.
http://docs.python-requests.org does not redirect to HTTPS.
In some browsers, visiting https://docs.python-requests.org, will give SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN, because the certificate's CN does not match the requested URL.
https://readthedocs.org/projects/requests/latest/ redirects http://docs.python-requests.org.
Expected Result
docs.python-requests.org Website via HTTPS
Actual Result
SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN: Unable to communicate securely with peer: requested domain name does not match the server’s certificate.
Reproduction Steps
Open https://docs.python-requests.org in a browser, or:
curl https://docs.python-requests.org
curl: (51) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'docs.python-requests.org'
