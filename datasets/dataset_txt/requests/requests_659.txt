I am unable to create a request using a relative path, even when I set the Host header.
requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL '/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields': No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http:///wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields?
I expect to be able to configure a Host header and use it in my request:
headers = {'Host':  'en.wikipedia.org/wiki' }

resp = requests.get("/List_of_HTTP_header_fields",  headers=headers)
resp = requests.get("/Virtual_hosting", headers=headers)
The domain name of the server (for virtual hosting), and the TCP port number on which the server is listening. The port number may be omitted if the port is the standard port for the service requested. (Mandatory since HTTP/1.1)
