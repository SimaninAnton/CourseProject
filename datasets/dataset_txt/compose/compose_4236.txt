Getting this error, even though I'm running out of the docker-osx shell. Fig seems to be working okay - it started my db and solr instances, but when it went to run web, I get the error in the title.
Here's a log of me getting into the shell and trying the commands, plus an echo of my DOCKER_HOST. I saw some similar cases in the issues, but the solutions seemed to be for Linux users. Saw this issue as well, and I already tried to destroy and reinitiate docker-osx.
Any help is appreciated! Thanks for all of your hard work!
