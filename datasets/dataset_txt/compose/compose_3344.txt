I accidentally gave my container the exact same name as the image used, and the error message that resulted was quite confusing..
[8] System error: not a directory
The config looks like this
godata:
  image: godata
  privileged: true
If this is not a valid option it would be helpful if it is caught while parsing the yml file rather than at run-time
Changing either the image pr container name solves the problem...
