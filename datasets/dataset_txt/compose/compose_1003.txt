I am aliasing a service that worked. I named it es.dev. However because of decisions made by Google it isn't a good idea.

The issue is that the alias won't change now from es.dev now.
I tried re-pulling the image, that didn't seem to work and it didn't look like it really got rid of all the images. Regardless I think it should still be able to pick up the new information in the composition file.
http://es.devx:9200 should load, but doesn't.
http://es.dev:9200 still loads (I am now testing it in Firefox), I also changed the cluster_name to see if that would update.
It didn't.
es:
    container_name: es
    hostname: es.devx

      new_net:
        aliases:
          - es.devx

    environment:
      - cluster.name=docker-clusterx
      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
      - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
    ulimits:
      memlock:

        hard: -1
