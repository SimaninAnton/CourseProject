Environment variables aren't used during the build phase.
So I think the docker-compose build command shouldn't display a warning if those are not set.
Sample docker-compose.yml:
version: "3.1"

services:
  foo: 
    build:
      context: .
    environment:
      BAR: ${BAR}
$ docker-compose build
WARNING: The BAR variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
It's useful though to see that warning when using docker-compose run.
