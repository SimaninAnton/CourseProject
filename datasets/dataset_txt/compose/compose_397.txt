(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
services:
  db:
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: database
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      TEST_VARIABLE: ''
    image: mysql:5.7.22
version: '3.2'
Ouput of cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3.2'

services:

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7.22
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: database
      TEST_VARIABLE: ${TEST_VARIABLE}
Steps to reproduce the issue
Copy the contents above into a docker-compose.yml file.
Start the service with TEST_VARIABLE=test docker-compose up -d.
Exec any command into the db container, for example: docker-compose exec db bash
Observed result
The system warns me with WARNING: The TEST_VARIABLE variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Running env in the container shows that the variable is present:
$ root@5b357d005cff:/# env
...
TEST_VARIABLE=test
...
Expected result
I only expect to see this warning if the environment variable was not supplied when the services were started. The warning claims that the variable is not exported.
