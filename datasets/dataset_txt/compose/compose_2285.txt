I have a ./docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  client:
    build:
      context: ./client
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
and ./client/dockerfile
FROM ...
RUN echo $NODE_ENV
the output of which is blank, meaning the environment variable set in compose yml file are being ignored in dockerfile while building container.
Incidentally it works while actually running the container:
CMD echo $NODE_ENV
The problem is only during build
