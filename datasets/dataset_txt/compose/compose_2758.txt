While using migrate-compose-file-v1-to-v2.py it added all my host based volumes to
the toplevel volumes and included a external: true to each of them.
This leads to:
ERROR: Validation failed in file './new.yml', reason(s):
volumes value Additional properties are not allowed ('${DOCKERBASE}/extrausers', '${DOCKERBASE}/log', were unexpected)
AFAIKT only name volumes should be in there, and those should have service names. So
anything with "/" in the name (i.e. all hosts paths that do not consist of an environment variable only) should be excluded from that mapping. These can easily be excluded by changing (in get_named_volumes()) the line if spec.is_named_volume to if spec.is_named_volume # and '/' not in spec.external (maybe import os and use os.dirsep instead.)
After that the converted file builds and works (assuming the PR for putting quotes around the version is applied as well).
