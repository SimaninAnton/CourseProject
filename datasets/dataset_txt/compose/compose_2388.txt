I am doing something pretty simple. I have a docker-compose.yml file:
  tsdb:
    build:
      context: ./tsdb_prod
    ....
and in the Dockerfile in that directory I have:
FROM influxdb:0.13
COPY file_prod /etc/file_prod
and I have the file_prod file in that directory.
running docker-compose build with --no-cache to rebuild my image after changes:

I'm pretty new to Docker. I'm sure I'm missing something stupid here. Is it building one image but starting another? I do see
2s 👍  $> docker ps -a

Not sure what's going on with that. I would appreciate anyone's insight.
