Problem
I have a cross OS script that calls docker-compose using xargs. While it works as expected in Linux and macOS, there is no stdout/stderr output on my terminal in
Step to reproduce:
docker-compose.yml
version: '3.2'
services:
  test_hay:
    image: alpine
    command: sh -c 'echo horse'
echo test_hay | xargs docker-compose run --rm
Nothing echos, but horse should
I'm using this, because I have a bash command like if [ "$(docker-compose run foo)" = "bar" ] inside a script called by xargs that's not working, but these steps are simpler to reproduce
Other investigation
All had no affect
I have also tried manipulating and verifying the tty status of stdin, stdout, and stderr via test -t 1, etc...
Tried compose file version 2.3
Use git for windows and cygwin terminal windows, and their xargs
Used a powershell windows
Using xargs env -i "PATH=$PATH" "TEMP=$TEMP" docker-compose to see if xargs was exporting something in the environment
Calling docker-compose --version does work, so that convinced me it wasn't related to #2775
I could not find way to reproduce this without xargs.
Work around
Adding the -T works, but this doesn't make any sense. This fails both when stdout is a tty and isn't a tty.
echo test_hay | xargs docker-compose run --rm -T
Using
docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
git xargs 4.6.0 (from git for windows 2.15.1.windows.2)
cygwin xargs 4.6.0
