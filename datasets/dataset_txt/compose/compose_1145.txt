Description
Variables in Docker Compose files support fallback values for empty/unset variables. For example ${MY_VAR:-default} will resolve to default if MY_VAR isn't set.
This doesn't work if the default value itself is a variable. For example, if DEFAULT_TAG=latest, and ${MY_VAR:-$DEFAULT_TAG} is specified in a Docker Compose file, the resulting value becomes $$DEFAULT_TAG instead of latest.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Given a variable named DEFAULT_TAG that is set to latest and a variable named CUSTOM_TAG that is not set, attempt to use $DEFAULT_TAG as the default value to $CUSTOM_TAG in a Docker Compose file.
Run docker-compose config to see the result.
version: '3.3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:${CUSTOM_TAG:-$DEFAULT_TAG}
Describe the results you received:
In the above example, the image resolves to nginx:$$DEFAULT_TAG.
version: '3.3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:$$DEFAULT_TAG
Describe the results you expected:
I expected nginx:latest.
version: '3.3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
