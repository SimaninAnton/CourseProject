Problem
Improve Docker Compose example documentation to talk about volumes
Solution
See #1039.
Add a Troubleshooting section at the end of Docker Compose documentation to mention that the starting directory has to be in a shared volume. If the example is being run on a Mac with Boot2Docker, then only /Users directory is mounted - so the example has to be run from /Users/xyz and not from /tmp/ or /opt/.
Way to reproduce this is to follow the basic Compose example in http://docs.docker.com/compose in /tmp/ directory on a Mac with Boot2Docker
