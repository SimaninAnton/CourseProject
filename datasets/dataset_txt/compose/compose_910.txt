I'm getting the following error when running docker-compose commands:
ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information. If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
Once I start getting the errors, I consistently get the errors for docker-compose commands until I restart Docker via the toolbar menu.
Turning off wifi doesn't help
Adding these entries to /etc/hosts doesn't help:
127.0.0.1       localunixsocket.local  
127.0.0.1       localunixsocket  
127.0.0.1       localunixsocket.lan
Docker diagnose comes up clean
Stopping all other containers than the 3 needed for this app doesn't help. All remaining containers are healthy.
ping localhost works
docker container ls (and other docker commands) works instantly
I can successfully telnet into all my running containers' published ports
I can use my app via the browser without any problems
