Looks like, we can't use the commande docker-compose run on a service with --net if an other container for this service is running
Given the network demo
$ docker network create demo
and a simple docker-compose.yml
app:
  image: nginx
  net: demo
When I start the service in background, everything's OK
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting test_app_1
But when I want to run a command on the same service
$ docker-compose run --rm app pwd
ERROR: 409 Conflict: Conflicting options: --net=<NETWORK> can't be used with links. This would result in undefined behavior
I've to stop the backgrounded app to fix the run command
$ docker-compose stop app 
Stopping test_app_1 ... done
$ docker-compose run --rm app pwd
