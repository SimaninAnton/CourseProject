Windows 10.
Docker toolbox 1.10.2 ( docker-compose version 1.6.0, build cdb920a )
When im trying to build a container im getting this error:
$ docker-compose.exe build

docker-compose returned -1
If i build without compose - no such error.
There is a pull request in docker itself for this : moby/moby#15491
But seems like compose doesn't handle this case.
