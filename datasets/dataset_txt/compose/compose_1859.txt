I installed docker compose on windows by pip and it shows
Successfully installed docker-compose-1.9.0
But when I use docker compose command
PS F:\> docker-compose --version

//output
Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest could not be extracted!
I also download the docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe from https://github.com/docker/compose/releases. Error is the same as above:
PS F:\> .\docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe

//output
Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest could not be extracted!
I can't find the solution on Google.It may be related to pyinstaller/pyinstaller#1866.
