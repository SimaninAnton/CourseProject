Using this simple configuration:
data:
  image: base/arch
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/mysql
  command: true

mysql:
  build: .
  volumes_from:
    - data
I would expect that the mysql data is persisted on the data-only container 'data'. But writing anything to /var/lib/mysql is NOT persisted across runs. Doing this with plain docker does work.
Am I overlooking something, or is this either a bug or a feature of fig?
The fig commands I'm trying to use are:
fig run mysql init
fig run mysql start
The mysql image has an entrypoint that takes init and start command. The first one populates /var/lib/mysql, the second one starts the mysql server with /var/lib/mysql as it's datadir. Both run, but the second one fails because /var/lib/mysql is empty.
The following is a minimal example of it failing:
fig run mysql /bin/bash -c "touch /var/lib/mysql/testfile && ls -l /var/lib/mysql"
fig run mysql /bin/bash -c "ls -l /var/lib/mysql"
Where the first ls -l shows that the file was created, where as the second one returns empty.
Using docker 1.3.0 and fig 1.0.0
