enable_ipv6 is still in the docs: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#enable_ipv6
and in the code: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/network.py#L37
it is working on compose-files v 2.x.
The problem is seems to be in validation file: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/config/config_schema_v3.3.json#L394
There is no permitted enable_ipv6 field
I used pretty simple docker-compose file:
version: '3.3'
networks:
  app_net:
    enable_ipv6: true
    driver: bridge

services:
  app:
    build: ./
    ports:
        - "8080:8080"
    networks:
        - app_net
The output is:
213:compose-example solovyev$ docker-compose up --build
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
networks.app_net value Additional properties are not allowed ('enable_ipv6' was unexpected)
