Hey guys,
I just want to gauge interest in this before I start working on it. Is this something others would find useful?
My project's yml file has grown so big that docker-compose up -d and docker-compose stop take about a minute so this would be super awesome if once the parent containers are started/stopped, the child containers would start/stop asynchronously.
