When defining multiple containers with links, such as
db <-- wordpress <-- nginxproxy
how can I recreate the wordpress container from an updated image and restart it with all containers that depend on it? Basically, I want fig up, but the db container (and other unrelated containers) should not be touched, for example, because a long downtime comes with restarting the db container. How would that work?
