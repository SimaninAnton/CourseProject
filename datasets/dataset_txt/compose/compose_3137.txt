I have a docker-compose.yml:
redis:
  image: redis
  volumes_from: ["data"]
data:
  image: tianon/true
  volumes: ["/data"]
If I start the app with up -d and then change the volumes_from line to add a mode (e.g. volumes_from: ["data:ro"]), the redis service isn't recreated when I run up -d again:
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting counter_data_1
counter_redis_1 is up-to-date
