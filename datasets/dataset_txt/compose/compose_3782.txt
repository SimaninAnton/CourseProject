I would like to understand how docker-compose provide names to the containers.
I noticed it is in the form <present_directory_name>_<service_name>_1.
What is this 1 at last component? If the directory name (or the project name) is "test" and service name "web" (inside yml), it would be test_web_1. Is there any possibility for it to be "test_web_2" or "test_web_3" etc.?
