In docker-compose 1.8.1 the following combination works;
docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
  test:
    extends:
      file: test.yml
      service: test
    ports:
      - 1000:1000/tcp
      - 1000:1000/udp
test.yml
version: '2'

services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    entrypoint: sleep 3600
docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
docker-py version: 1.10.3
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
docker-compose config
networks: {}
services:
  test:
    entrypoint: sleep 3600
    image: ubuntu
    ports:
    - 1000:1000/tcp
    - 1000:1000/udp
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
Note both UDP and TCP ports are forwarded.
With later versions of docker-compose...
docker-compose version 1.14.0-rc2, build 24dae73
docker-py version: 2.3.0
CPython version: 2.7.13
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1t 3 May 2016
services:
  test:
    entrypoint: sleep 3600
    image: ubuntu
    ports:
    - 1000:1000/udp
version: '2.0'
Note the missing TCP port mapping.
Doing the same thing without the 'extends' keyword work. Unfortunately all our deployments are templated this way.
Thanks
