Environment variable values can have new lines in them and docker-compose.yml already supports that because yml does:
test:
    image: alpine
    environment:
        a: "b\nc"
    command: sh -c "echo \"$$a\""
However, the env file syntax doesn't support this. It looks like it doesn't do anything more than split on newlines and the first = sign.
compose/compose/config/environment.py
Line 16 in 86b5ed1
 def split_env(env): 
One way would be to allow quoted strings in the env file. This is not backwards compatible because anyone who already has a quoted string in their env file would see unexpected behaviour. Hopefully someone else has a better idea?
