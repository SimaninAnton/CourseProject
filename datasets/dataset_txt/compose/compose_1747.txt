Would it be possible to specify network_alias without explicit dependency? For instance:
serviceA: 
  links:
    - B:serviceB
serviceB:
This will make docker-compose up A bring up B automatically. But what if you don't want that and merely want it available (and addressable by its alias: B) whenever it is up?
