It would be really nice to be able to call docker-compose ps with the -a flag to show running and exited containers alike, while omitting the flag would result in a list of only the running services. This would then match the API of docker ps, and make it easier to script docker-compose.
Or perhaps introduce both the -a flag and a --only-running flag to maintain backwards compatibility, and then start showing warnings for a while, after which the default is changed to only showing running services?
CLI example:
$ docker-compose create mysql 1>/dev/null 2>&1
$ docker-compose start mysql 1>/dev/null 2>&1
$ docker-compose ps mysql
f19b1b1c12e89648f3f6b8b1f89b353b079dad767a731f151cb72e1e15272d4f
$ docker-compose stop mysql 1>/dev/null 2>&1
$ docker-compose ps mysql

$ docker-compoes ps -a mysql
f19b1b1c12e89648f3f6b8b1f89b353b079dad767a731f151cb72e1e15272d4f
I'm sorry if this already is in docker-compose, I think I'm using the latest version but as I'm on Debian Stable I might've accidentally installed an ancient build.
My local version: docker-compose version 1.10.1, build b252738
