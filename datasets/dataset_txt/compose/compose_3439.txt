I'm not sure if this a bug or is it intentional. Consider the following docker-compose.yml:
db:
  image: mysql

web:
  image: nginx
  links:
    - db:database
Now when I do a docker-compose pull web it also pulls the mysql image. This may not be desired in a production system. Pulling both images probably makes sense if mysql is not present, but if its present and I want to upgrade just nginx, compose should not force me to pull mysql also.
Neither can I find a workaround similar to --no-deps for the up command.
