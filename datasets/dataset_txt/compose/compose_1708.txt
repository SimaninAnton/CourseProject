Hi
I have two containers in a docker-compose file.
The first one is referenced by many names :
version: '3'
services:
  www:
    image: kitematic/hello-world-nginx
    ports:
      - 80:80
  backend:
    image: kitematic/hello-world-nginx
    links:
      - www:www.domain.com
      - www:api.domain.com
      - www:alias.domaine.com
If I launch all containers in one time (docker-compose up -d), everything works fine.
$ docker-compose -f test.yml exec backend ping api.domain.com
PING api.domain.com (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.087 ms
But if I have many containers and for one reason, www (which is launched first) exited abrutly at the launch, backend container doesn't get links names for www (after I relaunched successfully www).
Order of launch:
docker-compose up -d
www dies abrutly
backend is fine but can't ping api.domain.com and www (which is normal since www dies)
docker-compose up -d
www restarts fine
backend still can't ping api.domain.com but can ping www
docker-compose kill (or stop) backend ; docker-compose up -d
backend still can't ping api.domain.com but can ping www
docker-compose stop backend ; docker-compose rm backend ; docker-compose up -d
everything work : backend can ping www and can ping api.domain.com
I have a .yml file to reproduce the issue.
Thanks in advance.
PS : my first container www dies abrutly because it's nginx and it's using upstream names (which are not valid until all container are launched). I resolved my problem by putting a sleep 30 in the nginx container, which is not very clean ...
