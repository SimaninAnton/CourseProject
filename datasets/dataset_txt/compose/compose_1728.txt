When services > my service > healthcheck > test has a wrong format (i.e. not beginning with "CMD" or "CMD-SHELL" or "NONE", no warning is issued.
Reproduce:
Have a docker-compose file with a simple but wrong health check, as attached.
Run docker-compose up.
version: "2.1"

services:

  myalpine:
    image: alpine
    command: "tail -f /dev/null"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["exit 0"]
      interval: "2s"
      timeout: "1s"
      retries: 5
Expected result:
Error or warning.
Actual result:
Normal execution.
Also, docker ps does only show the status as "Up X minutes" without the (healthy) or (unhealthy), etc. remark.
