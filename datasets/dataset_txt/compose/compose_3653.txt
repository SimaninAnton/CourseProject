Similar to #1356 and #1066 but for image names.
I've looked over the docker api reference, and the docker-py docs and neither include details about how to add labels to images (other than LABEL in the Dockerfile , which doesn't help us here).
It's possible the API already supports this, and the docs are just missing. I haven't had a chance to look through the docker source yet. Does anyone know offhand if this is already supported?
