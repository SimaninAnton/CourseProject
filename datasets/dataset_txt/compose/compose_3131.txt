I use environment variable declarations like the following:
  environment:
   - API_DEBUG=true
   - DATASTORE_URL=http://${ETCD_PORT_2379_TCP_ADDR}:${ETCD_PORT_2379_TCP_PORT}
   - KUBERNETES_URL=http://${KUBERNETESAPISERVER_PORT_8080_TCP_ADDR}:${KUBERNETESAPISERVER_PORT_8080_TCP_PORT}
With compose-1.5 this seems to pass through empty strings:
DATASTORE_URL=http://:
KUBERNETES_URL=http://:
How do we get the correct behaviour of passing these variables through as written (without any needless mangling)?
This breaks our ability to use compose to deploy testing environments that function correctly.
