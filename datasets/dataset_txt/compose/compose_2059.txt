I created a pull request. It git the label dco/no because it wasnÂ´t signed.
I then got it signed and forced push an amend.
The dco/no label was removed by the nice turtle.
I then switched to a different computer, made some changes and forced pushed another amend.
This time the commit was not signed, so the turtle reapplied the dco/no label.
I then fixed my key issues and forced pushed yet another amend.
This time the dco/no seems to not go away again.
