In v1 we would simply link two containers and access the linked container env variables, we would do,
web:
  links:
    - db

db:
  image: mysql:5.6
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mypass
Then access mysql's env in web entrypoint.sh,
set_parameter "database_password" ${DB_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
How we're supposed to do this when using v2, besides passing that as env directly to web?
