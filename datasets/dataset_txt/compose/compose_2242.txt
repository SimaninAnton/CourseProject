Hi:
I'm trying to specify a private IP address range (10.0.0) in my compose file as:
networks:
cdev:
driver: bridge
driver_opts:
com.docker.network.enable_ipv4: "true"
ipam:
config:
- subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
- gateway: 10.0.0.1
It gives me
"ERROR: Invalid subnet : invalid CIDR address" even though is part of the standard private addresses as per the std you point out in your documentation
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918
I suspect it might be something else though...
Thank you
