I have a container acting as a reverse proxy which forwards to other containers that are hosting websites.
One of the hosting container needs to know the ip of proxy.
When ever docker starts the proxy container, I would like to run a script on the docker host machine, that would in turn setup the website hosting container with the proper ip. Can this be done, and is it a usual way of doing things?
For more details :
I use an nginx reverse proxy in combination with nextcloud.
I need to set the trusted_proxies parameter on nextcloud which requires an IP.
I start nginx last so that I can setup my upstream values using the container names:
upstream nextcloudserver {
    server nextcloud_server;
}
Cheers!
