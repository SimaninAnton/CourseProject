Is there a reason environment variable substitution doesn't work in the value of privileged?
$ env SOCAT_PRIVILEGED=true docker-compose up -d
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
Service 'socat' configuration key 'privileged' contains an invalid type, it should be a boolean
socat:
  image: bobrik/socat
  privileged: ${SOCAT_PRIVILEGED}
...
Maybe this is related to #2025. I guess an env variable is always treated as a string, can't specify a boolean value?
