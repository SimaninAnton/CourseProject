I have a docker-compose with roughly the following content:
version: '2.3'
services:
  server_1:
    image: tensorflow/serving:latest-gpu
    runtime: nvidia
    per_process_gpu_memory_fraction: 0.3
This does not work, due to the following error:
ERROR: The Compose file './x.yaml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for services.server_1: 'per_process_gpu_memory_fraction'
If I run the command that would be equivalent to the above, using docker run ... --per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.3, it works without any issue. This is not an option however, since I need many services running and docker-compose comes quite handy
How can I pass the option through to tensorflow using a docker-compose file? Is this a docker-compose issue, or related to the used file version? I am using docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064
Appreciate the support, cheers
