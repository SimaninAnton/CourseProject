I'm setting pid: host for one of the services in my docker-compose.yml file. This works as expected if I just use this file -- however, if I apply an override file, this option no longer works and the container will have its own PID namespace.
This was working in 1.8, so this appears to be a regression. Adding pid: host to the override file does not appear to resolve the problem. There may be other settings that are also being overridden incorrectly as a result of this regression.
The example below demonstrates this -- the PID printed by the container's entrypoint.sh script is a very low number because it is running in its own PID namespace. If I don't use the override file, the PID printed is a much higher number because it is in the host's namespace.
I'll poke around in a few days if I get a chance to see what recent changes could have caused this. For the moment I've reverted to 1.8.
