I'm trying to run https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/MultiContainerApp.md using Docker-Compose with named pipes. It's failing with an error about client API version:
PS C:\Source\Musicstore> docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.windows.yml up
ERROR: client version 1.22 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.25, please upgrade your client to a newer version
PS C:\Source\Musicstore> docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.windows.yml ps
ERROR: client version 1.22 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.25, please upgrade your client to a newer version
