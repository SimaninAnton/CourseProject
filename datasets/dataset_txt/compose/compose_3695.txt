All of the examples I have found of compose use simple databases operating with a single node, e.g. redis or postgres. If I want to use something clustered like Riak or Cassandra, and I want a "realistic" setup (single physical node, but still), I would be scaling up to 5 or so nodes. Those nodes should be informed of each other's existence to form a cluster. docker-riak, for example, has a Makefile exposing some of those cluster operations. How does that work in compose's world? Am I supposed to create a different Docker image that uses a well-known service discovery endpoint, or something?
