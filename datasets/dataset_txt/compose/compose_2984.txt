I have a utility container for a Vulcan that runs against a running server. The vulcanctl command connects to the server and runs commands against it. For example: vulcanctl --vulcan http://vulcand:8182 host ls
Ideally, I would be able to define my utility container in docker-compose.yml like this:
vc:
  image: mailgun/vulcand:latest
  command: vulcanctl --vulcan http://vulcand:8182
  links:
    - vulcand
And be able to add to the defined command, such as: docker-compose run vc host ls, which would result in the command: vulcanctl --vulcan http://vulcand:8182 host ls.
As a workaround I've been defining a $VC environment variable :
vc:
  image: mailgun/vulcand:latest
  environment:
    - VC=vulcanctl --vulcan http://vulcand:8182
  links:
    - vulcand
And running commands with: docker-compose run vc /bin/bash -c '$VC host ls'. Not as clean, but works.
For completeness, vulcand is defined as:
vulcand:
  image: mailgun/vulcand:latest
  command: vulcand -apiInterface=0.0.0.0 -interface=0.0.0.0 -etcd=http://etcd:4001
  links:
    - etcd
  ports:
    - "8181:8181"
    - "8182:8182"
