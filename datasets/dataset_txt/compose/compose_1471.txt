I am unable to set a label (set in docker-compose.yml) using an env_file that overrides a base .env file setting. My expectations are as follows:
What I am doing:
setting the env var FOO=test in .env file
overriding the env var FOO=overriden in .env2
setting the label "foo=$FOO"
My expectations:
when I docker inspect my container I would expect the label for "foo" to equal "overridden".
labels can only be set dynamically through the use of env vars is my understanding.
Note:
If I set FOO=cmdoverridden then run docker-compose up -d then the label is overridden from and equals "cmdoverridden" as expected
I have pushed a repo here with an example of my expectations and would be really grateful if you could confirm if this is by design or a bug. I cannot seem to find anything saying that my expectation is wrong, other than as per the documentation:
If your service specifies a build option, variables defined in environment files will not be automatically visible during the build. Use the args sub-option of build to define build-time environment variables.
In the example I am using a build directive (it doesn't do anything really) but its an example of my usage case. I don't believe that the labels are being set during the build.
If you clone the repo and run thetest.ps1 file you will a summary of my expectations:
