Description of the issue
Currently the option --no-color does not seem to be usable with docker-compose stop
Assuming there is a file docker-compose.test.yml, none of these commands work:
docker-compose --no-color -f ".\docker-compose.test.yml" stop
docker-compose -f ".\docker-compose.test.yml" --no-color stop
docker-compose -f ".\docker-compose.test.yml" stop --no-color

Output of "docker-compose config"
None, since there is no option to validate my custom docker-compose.test.yml without renaming it, which I can not do.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Try any of the commands above with a docker-compose file named like mine.
Running docker on a windows server 2016 instance using the linux VM. Tested only in Powershell
