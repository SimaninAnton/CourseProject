My python isn't very good so apologies if I'm missing something obvious.
I tried (after installing all dependencies)
python setup.py build
I was expecting to get an .exe (being on Windows) which it didn't create, but it created .\build\lib\compose. Are you supposed to run this?
python ...path-to\build\lib\compose up
It runs the docker-compose command but it doesn't seem to actually use the code in that build directory. In build\lib\compose\__main__.py there's
from compose.cli.main import main
which seems to be importing from somewhere else than this build\lib\compose\cli\main (I checked by putting some test print statements which it didn't print, hence my suspicion). I changed it to
from cli.main import main
then it indeed imports from build\lib\compose\cli\main, but then it gives other errors
  File "C:\dev\compose\build\lib\compose\cli\errors.py", line 15, in <module>
    from ..const import API_VERSION_TO_ENGINE_VERSION
ValueError: Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package
I'm guessing there must be other steps to build this than what I've done.
Could someone please point me in the right direction on how to build docker-compose from source on Windows?
