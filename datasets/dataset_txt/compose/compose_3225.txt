Motivation for this proposal
moby/moby#15182 will be in 1.9.0 allow for build args
new users are often confused when the environment section isn't applied during the build phase
Proposal
Move all build related configuration into a build: section in the service. Example
web:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.name
    args:
       key: value
  ...
This should help clarify the fields that are related to the build phase (and the fields that are not).
Backwards compatibility
On the first release both build and dockerfile would still be allowed at the top level of the service definition. A dockerfile at the top level would print a deprecation warning.
On the following release dockerfile at the top level of the service definition would be removed, and it must be under the build section. For trivial cases, a config of build: path/to/context would still be supported.
