What I have
5 nodes cluster
Compose 1.6.0
Swarm 1.1.0
Engine 1.10.0
What I do
With the following docker-compose.yml:
www:
  image: nginx
  ports:
    - "8888:80"
I run:
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
What I expect to see
Container is created, then recreated.
What I see instead
Container is created, but when trying to recreate it, I see:
Recreating repro_www_1
ERROR: unable to find a node that satisfies container==a0e31139c706d24a739b88034e1f0b266eb049b6b304580c3b29bf4535d1c958
(Where a0e3... is the ID of the existing container.)
Cause
Compose provides a placement constraint to force the new container to be on the same host as the old one. But when there is a port mapping, this fails, even if the container has been stopped first, because Swarm doesn't deal with port mappings the same way as Engine does (a stopped container is still considered to use the port).
I attached the logs of docker inspect (before recreating the container) and the verbose output of docker-compose up -d.
