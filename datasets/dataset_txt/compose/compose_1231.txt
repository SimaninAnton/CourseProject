Is it possible to share the host directory while specifying a Dockerfile for a service?
For example, this doesn't mount the volume:
version: '2'
services:
    test:
        container_name: test
        hostname: test
        build: ./test
        volumes:
            - .:/src
        ports:
            - "80:80"
but this does (specifies image instead of build):
version: '2'
services:
    test:
        container_name: test
        hostname: test
        image: nginx
        volumes:
            - .:/src
        ports:
            - "80:80"
Is this expected?
