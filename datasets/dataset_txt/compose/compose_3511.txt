In one terminal session I'm tailing a container:
$ docker-compose logs myapp
myapp_1 | starting app ..
myapp_1 | listenging on port 8080
On a separate session, I would like to do:
docker exec -d myapp_1 sh -c 'echo "foo" >>/dev/stdout'
and have it print foo to stdout on the running container above. Does anyone know of a way to do this? I've tried the solution in http://serverfault.com/a/634296, but it didn't work for me.
