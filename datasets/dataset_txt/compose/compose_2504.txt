Hey, I am trying to volume mount an nfs share but I am running into some issues with that. When I run a regular docker command such as:
docker run -i -t privileged=true -v /mnt/bluearc:/mnt/bluarc -v /net:/net ubuntu bash
I have my desired drive mounted at /mnt/bluearc. However, if I run it with docker-compose:
test_ser:
  container_name: test_ser
  hostname: test_ser
  image: ubuntu
  restart: always
  working_dir: /repo/drop_zone_dub
  volumes_from:
    - nerve_repo_data
  volumes:
    - /mnt/bluearc:/mnt/bluearc
    - /net:/net
  privileged: true
  command: bash
When I try to access the directories I get the following error:
Too many levels of symbolic links
What is compose doing differently that would cause this? Thanks
