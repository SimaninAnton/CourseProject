Hey,
We are seeing strange behaviour with compose and default cred helpers when pulling as part of a build.
Both our image, and our base image are in a private gcloud repo.
We do gcloud auth configure-docker to configure docker to give us this config:
{
  "credHelpers": {
    "gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "us.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "eu.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "asia.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "staging-k8s.gcr.io": "gcloud"
  }
}
Which allows us to pull private images, eg:
bash-4.2$ docker pull eu.gcr.io/at-artefacts/platform-base-nodejs
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from at-artefacts/platform-base-nodejs
Digest: sha256:ca558cb49a6fd2e0f178e4016c30638ed722328608bfb87fdc389c76a9c9af03
Status: Image is up to date for eu.gcr.io/at-artefacts/platform-base-nodejs:latest
We have this compose file:
version: '3.2'

services:
  app:
    image: "eu.gcr.io/at-artefacts/platform-base-nodejs:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}"
    restart: always
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_BASE_CENTOS: "${GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_BASE_CENTOS:-latest}"
And a docker-compose pull doesn't give any output, but it does pull the image.
bash-4.2$ docker-compose pull
Pulling app ... done
But, a build with --pull in it fails:
bash-4.2$ docker-compose build --pull --compress app
Building app
Step 1/8 : FROM eu.gcr.io/at-artefacts/platform-base-centos:latest
ERROR: Service 'app' failed to build: unauthorized: You don't have the needed permissions to perform this operation, and you may have invalid credentials. To authenticate your request, follow the steps in: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication
Any ideas?
