https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/ does not have an sdist download for 1.21.2
This makes it impossible to do for example
pip2 install --no-binary :all: awsebcli
as it will error out
No matching distribution found for docker-compose<1.22.0,>=1.21.2 (from awsebcli)
Please post an sdist for the latest version. Thanks!
