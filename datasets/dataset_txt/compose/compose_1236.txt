Now I have such a situation in my using of docker-compose:
I use docker-compose to start a network of test instances to do my component test, and different services may start component test in the same time sometimes.
In another words, these two command will start in the same time sometimes:
docker-compose -f compose-serviceA-test.yml up -d --build
docker-compose -f compose-serviceB-test.yml up -d --build
At this time, I find something strange happened:
Successfully tagged serviceA:lates
Recreating rabbitmq-serviceB ...
Recreating redis-serviceB ...
Recreating rabbitmq-serviceB
Recreating mysql-serviceB...
Recreating riak-serviceB ...
Recreating serviceB ... done
It seems docker-compose cannot deal with the concurrently running , or it will be mixed.
Is there any solution to this ?
Thanks very much
