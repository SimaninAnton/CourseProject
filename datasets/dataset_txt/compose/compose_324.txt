Description of the issue
I have a docker-compose.yml file where I have multiple services built from the same file but which have different commands. I don't want to build the same image multiple times every time I do a docker-compose build so I am setting both an image and a build on the service, per the documentation:
If the image does not exist, Compose attempts to pull it, unless you have also specified build, in which case it builds it using the specified options and tags it with the specified tag.
Related to:
#2092
#3853
Example docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  build:
    image: example
    build: .
    command: npx tsc
  test
    image: example
    command: npx mocha
Example Dockerfile
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /app
build works fine...
$ docker-compose build
test uses an image, skipping

pull fails, it erroneously tries to pull example from dockerhub
$ docker-compose pull
Pulling build ... error

Steps to reproduce the issue
Copy docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile example files above to local machine
In same folder with both files run docker-compose pull
Observed result
It attempts to pull images from a remote and reports errors (e.g. ERROR: pull access denied for example)
Expected result
There are two errors as far as I can tell, I expect neither to happen:
A service which has both an image and a build should not attempt to pull an image, it should be skipped.
A service which references an image which was built from another service which has an image and a build should not be pulled, it should be skipped.
