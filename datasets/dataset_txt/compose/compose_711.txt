Description of the issue
The --renew-anon-volumes should allow me mount a new volume to a previously anonymous volume without recreating all containers.

services:
  service1:
    image: my-image:2
    volumes:
     - /tmp:/greetings

  service2:
    image: other-image:1
Steps to reproduce the issue
Given that my-image:2 defined VOLUME /greetings and that we just added /tmp:/greetings, run docker-compose up -d --renew-anon-volumes
Observed result
service1's /greetings now points to /tmp, but both service1 and service2 got recreated.
Expected result
service1's /greetings now points to /tmp and only service1 is recreated.
