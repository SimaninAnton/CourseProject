Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):
CentOS 7, Docker installed from official repo.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Install docker-compose
Write some compose .yml files that set the restart policies for services.
Describe the results you received:
including these lines appears to work as expected:
restart: on_failure:3
restart: always
However, including this line:
restart: no
Results in an error message of:
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.email.yml', reason(s):
services.dev_email_service.restart contains an invalid type, it should be a string
changing the line to read:
restart: "no"
work as expected.
Describe the results you expected:
Would not expect to have to put "no" in quotes, as the other policies do not require quotes and the manual does not describe quotes as required.
Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):
Also tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 system running the same versions of docker and docker-compose.
Same results.
