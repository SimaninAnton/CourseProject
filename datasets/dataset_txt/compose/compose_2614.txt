@ripcurl00d suggested me to post this here.
Environment Details:
VirtualBox
Networking through NAT (adapter 1) and intnet (adapter 2)
Docker Version:
Client:
version: 1.10.2

Server:
version: 1.10.2
I followed the below installation procedure of docker-compose
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python-pip

pip install docker-compose

docker-compose version
I am facing the below mentioned error while trying to check the installation docker-compose.
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 'newline'

/usr/local/bin/docker-compose: line: '<!DOCTYPE html>'
Has anyone encountered this error? How to resolve this?
