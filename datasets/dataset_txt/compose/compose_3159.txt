Steps to reproduce (against docker 1.9.0-rc3):
Create a new project, or set a new project name
Run any service with the new project name docker-compose --x-networking run service bash
You'll get an error:
Cannot start container b631dcb1feea803af2d06471789fe3646a3b6f59af04bc771f66fd70137a024b: network networking not found
We need to create the network as part of run as well as up I think.
