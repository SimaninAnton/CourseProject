docker run has a parameter --isolation that can be used to set additional isolation modes when running Docker containers. For example, docker run --isolation=hyperv is commonly used on Windows with Hyper-V. Given that most of the other run options are already supported such as security_opt and privileged, I think it makes sense that isolation should be there too.
Here's an example of how I would like to use it in docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  sql:
    image: windowsservercore
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
#    isolation: 'hyperv'

  web:
    image: windowsservercore
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
#    isolation: 'hyperv'

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: nat
