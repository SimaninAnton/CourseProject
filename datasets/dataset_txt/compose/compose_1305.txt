From @lawrencepit in docker/for-mac#1824:
We have this docker-compose.yml file:
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    image: test
    container_name: test
    ports:
      - 0:80
Then:
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose-test.yml config
services:
  test:
    container_name: test
    image: test
    ports:
    - 080/tcp
version: '2.0'
Expected result: The output should be:
    ports:
    - 0:80/tcp
