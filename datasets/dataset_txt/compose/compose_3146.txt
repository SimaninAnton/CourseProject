When using the --x-networking feature in docker-compose 1.5 (docker-engine 1.9), is it possible to get a "simple name" added to /etc/hosts without knowing the container name beforehand and without using the container_name directive?
For example, the following compose file in a directory called dockercompose might produce the /etc/hosts entries below:
web:
  image: firstapp
web2:
  image: secondapp
/etc/hosts entries in the auto generated "dockercompose_web_1" container looks like:
172.18.0.2  dockercompose_web2_1
172.18.0.2  dockercompose_web2_1.dockercompose
I was hoping I would see the following entry as well:
172.18.0.2  web2
Let's say the image firstapp is hardcoded to communicate with a host named web2 and secondapp is harcoded to communicate with a host named web. Is it possible to get this circular communication working and maintain the ability to startup multiple instances of the overall app?
