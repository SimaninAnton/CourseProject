I thought I'd try using fig insteam of my usual Makefile, and played with @crosbymichael 's dsh: https://github.com/SvenDowideit/dsh/tree/go-dockerclient
it also hangs when setting the command: /bin/bash - i'm assuming that this is because you're not setting docker run -i to get stdin - I'm hoping you'll tell me there's a simple flag i didn't notice :)
(but having fig sit there when I can see that the container existed almost instantly is probably not really what is intended either)
