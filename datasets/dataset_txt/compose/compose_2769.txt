It would be good to allow usage of the underscores in a project names. Compose allows usage of underscores in a container names, but in case of a project name underscores being silently removed.
docker-compose -p api_backend up -d with service name "service_a" will result in a container with name "apibackend_service_a_1" and labels:
"com.docker.compose.project": "apibackend",
"com.docker.compose.service": "service_a",
Looks like undocumented feature.

 return re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]', '', name.lower()) 
Is there particular need to remove underscores in a project name? Having direct mapping of project name to internal docker compose naming would help us to do less non transparent name transformations when automating compose based deployments.
In any case it would be useful to have documentation describing naming conventions and transformations.
