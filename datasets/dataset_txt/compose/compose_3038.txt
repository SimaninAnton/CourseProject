Hello,
I'm having some problems to connect with network at docker-compose.yml
Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5
docker-compose version: 1.5.1
docker-machine version 0.5.1 (7e8e38e)
For install some dependencies, inside of entrypoint I has the following command: composer install. And received the following message:
SlowTimer [54662ms] at curl
Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 180 seconds exceeded
When I try to run apt-get update command the same thing happens. Could anyone help me?
