I am trying to mount a file into a container but i am getting error ""
Following is my docker-compose.yml
nginx:
  image: nginx
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
As per following discussion moby/moby#13276 have moved everything in c:/Users/${userid} folder. Also to share i am using rancheros instead of standard boot2docker.
