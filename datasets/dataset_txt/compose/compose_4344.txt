It would be useful to be able to run many figs in parallel, for instance to support a CI system similar in nature to drone.io (which fig appears to be partially, and thankfully, emulating in python).
One issue in particular is the fact that containers are removed when fig is run, to support workflows where the run configuration had changed (thanks @bfirsh).
I have no recommendations or patches, apologies!
