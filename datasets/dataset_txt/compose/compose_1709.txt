It seems like docker-compose.exe does not work in a Windows container as it seems to be bundled with Python 2 binary.
I just had to rerun a test for the Chocolatey package 1.10.1 as the download didn't work in the approval. So instead of spinning up a Windows VM I just took a Windows Container for that manual test. Well the package works and downloads the exe file, but running docker-compose --version shows an error:
$ docker run -it stefanscherer/chocolatey powershell

Using Python 3.6.0 and pip works instead, also in a Windows container:

PS C:\> 
So is it possible to bundle the exe file with Python 3 to fix that problem?
