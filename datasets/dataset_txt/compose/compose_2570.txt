Tried to start a multi-container application using docker-compose.yml:
version: "2"
services:
  db:
    container_name: "db"
    image: arungupta/oreilly-couchbase
    ports:
      - 8091:8091
      - 8092:8092 
      - 8093:8093 
      - 11210:11210
  web:
    image: arungupta/oreilly-wildfly
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - COUCHBASE_URI=db
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
Got the error:
docker-compose up -d
Creating network "hellojavaee_default" with the default driver
Pulling db (arungupta/oreilly-couchbase:latest)...
Pulling repository docker.io/arungupta/oreilly-couchbase
ERROR: Error: image arungupta/oreilly-couchbase not found
Built the image, and then tried the command again. This gave the error:
docker-compose up -d
Creating db
ERROR: Conflict. The name "/db" is already in use by container 1eea595a71f84e47a5b889951e950534f1b1d949666fb85a577795f0423a8a1b. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
If one of the service could not be started then the containers started by other services are exited. But this does not allow to run the docker-compose up -d command again.
