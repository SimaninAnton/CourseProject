I'm not sure this is a docker-machine or docker-compose issue, but will try to explain it.
I have to following compose file:
services:
    db:
      image: postgres
      volumes:
          - .pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
   .... more services...
I run docker-compose and and docker-machine the commands from my laptop.
The local laptop user is goetas and the folder where is stored the application on my laptop is /home/goetas/projects/events.
When running:
eval $($docker machine env my-machine)
docker-compose up
On the remote hosts (my-machine) the container is created, and the a folder /home/goetas/events/.pgdata has been created (to store the database data).
No user goetas has been created on the remote host, only a folder.
From what I could guess, the naming strategy is /home/[LOCAL-USER]/[LOCAL-FOLDER-NAME].
My question is: Is there a way to configure the folder that is used as working directory when running the container?
