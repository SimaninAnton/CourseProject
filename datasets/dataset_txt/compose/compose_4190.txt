Some of the containers in my project require sensitive data (such as 3rd party API tokens) to be passed as environment variables. I understand that I can enumerate these without values in my fig.yml to be picked up from the host environment, but then I still need some way to get them there, meaning one of:
Passing these on every fig invocation (unacceptable due to the repetition), or
Yet another script to wrap fig and load these environment variables from disk.
Docker already provides support for loading a container environment from disk in the --env-file option to docker run. It would be nice if fig exposed this as environment_file as a parallel to the current environment option.
I'd be happy to submit a PR for this, but in order to do so I would need pointing in the right direction by someone who actually knows Python. I figure the implementation would likely be as easy as extending this constant and that I'd probably need a test similar to this one. Am I on the right track so far?
