These are my configs :
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
Docker compose file version 3.3
I tried giving a certain user created inside docker some sudo level permissions. But on stopping and restarting the container all the changes (in the /etc/sudoers.d/user file) were lost. Similar experience with the /etc/hosts file, all ip=>domain mappings were lost. Is it a caveat of docker containers or am I doing something wrong here ? @shin- had previously mentioned that if the compose containers run on the legacy bridge network I might face this issue, but I dont think this the issue in my case.
The network that my compose containers run on is frappedocker_default
My docker network ls results :
NETWORK ID          NAME                   DRIVER              SCOPE
d487147224bb        bridge                 bridge              local

c48fb6fff012        none                   null                local
My docker inspect frappedocker_default results :
