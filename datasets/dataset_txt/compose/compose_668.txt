Description of the issue
The feature flag --exit-code-from does not always cause docker-compose up to exit with the specified service's exit code. An example scenario:
The composition is service A and B. B fails during startup, A gets shutdown due to the implicit --abort-on-container-exit. The recorded exit code for A is 143 however the docker-compose up command exits with 0.
$ docker-compose up --exit-code-from a
:
project_b_1 exited with code 1
Aborting on container exit...
Stopping project_a_1  ... done

$ echo $?
0

$ docker ps -a

Steps to reproduce the issue
Define two services a and b in docker-compose.yml.
Let service b crash/exit on startup.
Start composition using docker-compose up --exit-code-from a`.
Observed result
Exit code is 0.
Expected result
Exit code !0 (here likely: 143 or even better what the service actually reported)
