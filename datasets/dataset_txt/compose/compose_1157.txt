the scenario :
config.yaml version >=3.2 which contains service port like:
ports:
- "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"
Run of the following commands fails in the second command
docker-compose config > config.yaml
docker-compose -f config.yaml up
The error I got in the docker-compose up line is:
services.mysql.ports contains unsupported option: 'external_ip'
The issue:
The output of docker-compose for version >= 3.2
Contain service ports in the following format:
ports:
- external_ip: 127.0.0.1
published: 3306
target: 3306
