I'm trying to setup some dockerised NAS, with mergerfs and samba:
services:

  mergerfs:
    build: ./mergerfs  # just debian and install latest release
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
    volumes:
      - media:/mnt/pool
      - /mnt/data0:/mnt/data0
      ...
   ...

  samba:
    image: dperson/samba
    command: ﻿﻿-s'media;/srv/media;yes;no;yes'  # guest allowed, not RO
    ﻿﻿volumes:
      - media:/srv/media
    depends_on:
      - mergerfs
    ...

volumes:
  media:
The problem is that, while I can read/write to /srv/media on samba, it doesn't get through to /mnt/pool on mergerfs.
(I can see this by watching docker-compose logs mergerfs while doing docker-compose exec samba sh -c "echo 'foobar' > /srv/media/test.txt" which shows nothing in logs, versus the equivalent exec mergerfs which does.)
If I change the named volume media for a path on the host machine I get the same affect: writes to samba make it to the host mount, can be read back, but are not propagated to /mnt/pool in mergerfs.
It seems as if when I run /usr/bin/merger/fs ... /mnt/pool it's actually shadowing the mount, and completely disengaged from it. Should this work, or am I doing it wrong?
In summary:
Writing to samba writes through to the host mount (that should be the pool mount)
Writing to mergerfs pool writes to the host physical disk mounts, but not the pool mount on host
