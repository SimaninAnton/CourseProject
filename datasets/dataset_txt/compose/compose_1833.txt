I just recently upgraded to the latest docker toolbox and compose versions, and now my volume bindings are no longer working. I receive an "invalid bind mount spec" error when trying to build my container. Here is my compose file:
version: '2'
services:
  fatbot:
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    container_name: fatbot
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - C:\Users\shamil8124\Desktop\backend:/var/www/html
    command: /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
And the error:
ERROR: for fatbot  Cannot create container for service fatbot: Invalid bind mount spec "C:\\Users\\shamil8124\\Desktop\\backend:/var/www/html:rw": Invalid volume specification: 'C:\Users\shamil8124\Desktop\backend:/var/www/html:rw'
Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask for help with this. I've been lost for the past few days, and the docker forums along with Stackoverflow have not helped.
