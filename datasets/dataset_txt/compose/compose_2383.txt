docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  alpine:
    image: "alpine:latest"
    restart: unlesss-stopped
In the previous, unlesss-stopped is an invalid value for the restart policy name.
sudo docker-compose up
Does not complain, and a container is created and started with an incorrect restart policy. Incorrect, based on docker inspect output.
In contrast, this fails:
sudo docker create --restart='unlesss-stopped' alpine
docker: invalid restart policy unlesss-stopped.
See 'docker create --help'.
