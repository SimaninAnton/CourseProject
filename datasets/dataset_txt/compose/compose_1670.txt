Hello,
When running "docker-compose down" from a different folder than the one originally used to run "docker-compose up", it will fail.
It seems that it creates a network name with hardcoded folder name, which is bad design.
Please see below example, showing it works while I am in folder1, but if I rename the folder to folder2, it doesn't work anymore.
regards,
Marius
