Actually , we can use the instruction docker-compose build --no-cache to avoid using the cache.
For instance , if we have the following docker-compose file
version: '2'
services:
  service1:
    build:
      context: .
    container_name: service1_cont_name
  service2:
    build:
      context: .
    container_name: service2_cont_name
If we need to apply --no-cache only for service1 , it will be usefull to have an option in the build instruction to define this kind of action.
