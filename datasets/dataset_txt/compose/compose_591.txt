Description of the issue
After changing my windows password docker runs into problems.
Context information (for bug reports)
It would be nice if docker could give a warning that there is something wrong with the password instead of a driver programming issue.

Additional information
Interesting behavior BTW I've changed my password back to the password it was before and docker automatically worked again. Does it store it in plain text?
