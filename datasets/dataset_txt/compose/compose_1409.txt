According to documentation at https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#link_local_ips this should be supported:
version: "3.2"
networks:
  test_net:
    driver: bridge
services:
  alpine:
    image: alpine:latest
    networks:
      test_net:
        link_local_ips:
          - 192.168.1.10
A simple workaround to this issue would be appreciated. thanks
