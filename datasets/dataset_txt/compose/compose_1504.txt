I have a problem with my .env file when it's not in the same folder as the docker-compose file. When I place it in a subfolder and reference it, it will simply say the variables are undefined and will default to a blank string. When I remove the .env file it says it can't find the .env file, so it finds the file but doesn't do anything. When I move the .env file to the same directory as the docker-compose file and update it's path or create a symlink instead, all works fine.
Apparently docker-compose has issues with loading env files that are not in the same directory as the docker-compose file.
Currently I "fixed" this by symlinking the .env file as it's shared with a Laravel project in a subfolder.
My docker-compose file (simplified):
version: '3'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mariadb
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql/data
    env_file:
      - ./api/.env
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${DB_DATABASE}
      MYSQL_USER: ${DB_USERNAME}
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}

volumes:
  mysql_data:
