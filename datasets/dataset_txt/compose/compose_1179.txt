When I run "docker-compose" via remote powershell, it always throws below exception. It's not a powershell exception. When I run the "docker-compose" on local machine powershell, it works fine.
docker-compose : Building web
+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (Building web:String) [], RemoteException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError
My environment is a Windows physical host, then create a VM on top of it, on the VM install "docker-compose". From physical host, I use remote powershell "Enter-PSSession -VMname )get-vm).Name -Credential administrator" to connect to the VM. Then I tried "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build" or just "docker-compose", the exception thrown. My docker-compose.yml is a very simple one and it works fine on local powershell.
My simple docker-compose.yml is as below:
version: '3'
services:
web:
build: .
as of Dockerfile:
FROM windowsservercore
RUN cmd.exe /c echo test > c:/test.txt
