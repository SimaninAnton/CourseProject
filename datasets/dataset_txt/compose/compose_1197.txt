$ docker --version                                     
Docker version 17.07.0-ce, build 87847530f7
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build unknown
$ uname -a
Linux machine 4.12.12-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Sep 10 09:41:14 CEST 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux
With the docker-compose.yml file:
version: '2'
services:
   test:
      build: .
      domainname: rendre.fr
and the Dockerfile:
From alpine

RUN apk update && apk add net-tools

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "hostname;domainname; nisdomainname"]
Doing docker-compose up --build I get the following output:
test_1  | 88c5aee837f5.rendre.fr
test_1  | (none)
test_1  | (none)
Whereas I would have expected to see rendre.fr instead of (none) for the two last one.
This problem prevent NIS from working inside the container.
The problem was initially observed in an ubuntu based image.
