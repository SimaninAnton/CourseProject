I use boot2docker to up a docker. then i run sample project reference with https://orchardup.github.io/fig/django.html
i found the cmd can't work as expected.
$ fig run web django-admin.py startproject figexample .
it only create a project folder to docker vm, not in my current folder.
if i use pure docker environment, we can correct get project folder.
anyone came across the same issues.
