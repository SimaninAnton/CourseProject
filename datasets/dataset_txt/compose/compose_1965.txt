Working with Windows containers the command should accept single backslashes for file names. At the moment I have to use double backslashes in command, but can use single backslashes for volumes. There is a lot of work going on eg. in moby/moby#27644 to bring in a better windows experience using 'normal' windows pathes.
works

    image: microsoft/windowsservercore
    command: cmd /c dir c:\\config\\example.yml
