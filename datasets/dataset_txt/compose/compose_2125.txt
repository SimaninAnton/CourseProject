If you run «docker-compose logs» and one container's logging driver is set to syslog, compose has an unexpected behaviour.
It may show logs from some of the containers that use default json-file logging driver, but exits as soon as it reaches a container using syslog. Sometimes it shows no logs at all.
docker-compose test file:
version: '2'

services:
  serviceA:
    image: ubuntu:16.04
    command: echo serviceA
    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        syslog-address: "tcp://localhost:514"

  serviceB:
    image: ubuntu:16.04
    command: echo serviceB
Tests:
$ docker-compose logs
Attaching to testlogs_serviceB_1, testlogs_serviceA_1
ERROR: configured logging reader does not support reading
$ docker-compose logs
Attaching to testlogs_serviceB_1, testlogs_serviceA_1
serviceB_1  | serviceB
ERROR: configured logging reader does not support reading
$ 
I guess it should consistently show logs from containerA and containerB, like when logging driver is set to «none»:
$ docker-compose logs
Attaching to testlogs_serviceA_1, testlogs_serviceB_1
serviceA_1  | WARNING: no logs are available with the 'none' log driver
serviceB_1  | serviceB
$ 
Please note that I did not test how it behaves with other drivers.
