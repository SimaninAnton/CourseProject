I noticed an inconsistency when when trying to build containers with invalid names.
if the name includes a hyphen, the error is:
$ fig build
Invalid service name "foo-bar" - only [a-zA-Z0-9] are allowed
Notice the uppercase letters in the regex.
If renamed to be camel case:
... 
build output
...
Building FooBar...
Invalid repository name (hub_FooBar), only [a-z0-9-_.] are allowed
Now notice that Uppercase is not allowed, but also notice that hyphens and underscores and periods are allowed.
