Hi,
docker-compose run includes short and long option to run as specified user:
-u, --user=""
see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/run/
docker-compose exec knows only the long option to run the command as this user:
--user
see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/
For consistency:
Add short option
-u
to docker-compose exec.
Besides: docker run and exec both have short AND long options:
-u, --user
