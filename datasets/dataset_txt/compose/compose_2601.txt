The Windows Docker Engine recently got support for named pipe (think of the unix socket on Linux) instead of listening on local http port 2375. See moby/moby#19911 for the first PR.
Now it seems that Docker Compose needs this support as well when the Docker Engine is no longer listening on tcp port.
