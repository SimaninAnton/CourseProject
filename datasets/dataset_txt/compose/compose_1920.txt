you can reproduce this with thoses 2 files:
version: '2'
services:
    test:
        build: .
        tmpfs: /mnt/tmpfs
FROM alpine:3.4

VOLUME /mnt/tmpfs

CMD /bin/sh
then run:
docker-compose up -d this one works
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate this one fails with this message:
Recreating tmp_test_1
ERROR: for test Cannot create container for service test: Duplicate mount point '/mnt/tmpfs'
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
version of Docker : Docker version 1.12.2, build bb80604
and tested with 2 versions of docker compose:
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build f3628c7
docker-compose version 1.9.0-rc4, build 181a4e9
At first I thought it was the same issue as moby/moby#23301 but if this was still an issue the first docker-compose up -d should have failed too. So I'm not sure if this is a problem with docker-compose or with docker itself as I don't really know what docker-compose does on --force-recreate
