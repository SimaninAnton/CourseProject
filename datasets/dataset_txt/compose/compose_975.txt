Hi
I have installed cURL, Node.js, docker toolbox on windows 7 and now i am trying to build the hyperledger sawtooth image using
docker-compose -f sawtooth-default.yaml up
This command is not at all completing. It is stuck at the last stage
sawtooth-validator-default : Now building on top of block ........
I tried waiting till long long hours but still not completing.
I tried using
docker-compose -f sawtooth-default.yaml down
docker-compose -f sawtooth-default.yaml up --force-recreate
Can anyone let me know why not able to build the sawtooth image.
