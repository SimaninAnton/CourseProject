hello
I did a container for oracle 11g and it works properly in standalone mode
I create a docker-compose.yml with this
database_host:
build: 'database'
ports:
- "1521:1521"
- "8080:8080"
compose runs the container but at the end I see this message
database_host_1 exited with code 0
I already tried to used command: /bin/bash in compose with the same result
is not a problem with the port 8080 nothing running on that port
if I run the new container (database_host_1) with the command docker "run" it woks properly and the image is created properly
the question is why the container runs properly standalone and don't run with compose ???
btw I am using windows 10 with docker toolbox, docker version 1.10.0
