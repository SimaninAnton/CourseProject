Hello,all
my docker-compose.yaml:
services:
   oracle:
    container_name: oracle
    image: oracle:sddb
    ports:
        - "49160:22"
        - "49161:1521"
    expose:
        - "22"
        - "1521"
   sd:
    build: /home/Dockerfile/sd
    container_name: sdp
    image: sdp:latest
    ports:
         - "18888:8081"
    expose:
         - 8081
    links:
         - oracle
    depends_on:
         - oracle
    command: ["./wait-for-it.sh", "db:1521"]
run docker-compose
[root@localhost composetest]# docker-compose up
Creating network "composetest_default" with the default driver
Building sd
my question is that, why does compose build sd first?
why not create oracle container first ?
