I'm using the following command in my shell script to wait for a docker container to startup
docker logs -f myContainer | grep -qe "Server startup complete"
When doing the same with compose, it still works, but I get this nasty Traceback.
docker-compose logs -f --no-color myContainer | grep -qe "Server startup complete"
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 3, in
File "compose/cli/main.py", line 61, in main
File "compose/cli/main.py", line 113, in perform_command
File "compose/cli/main.py", line 507, in logs
File "compose/cli/log_printer.py", line 98, in run
IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
docker-compose returned -1
Would be nice to handle that!
Thanks
