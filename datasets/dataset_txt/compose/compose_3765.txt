I was experimenting with docker-compose and I saw something a little bit disturbing in my output of phpinfo() function: LAMPDB_1_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD lamppass
my docker-compose.yml:
lampapp:
build: .
ports:
"8000:80"
links:
lampdb
lampmemcache
volumes:
/var/
lampdb:
image: "mysql:5"
volumes:
./mysql:/etc/mysql/conf.d
environment:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=lamppass
lampmemcache:
image: "memcached"
I know that it is set by 'environment:' but my question: Is it O.K. (I think it is not) any application from my 'composed' docker infrastructure to see set passwords from the installation process ?
