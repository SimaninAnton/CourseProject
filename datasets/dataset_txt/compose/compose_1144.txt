Problem
In the docs it is stated that:
Setting entrypoint will both override any default entrypoint set on the service’s image with the ENTRYPOINT Dockerfile instruction, and clear out any default command on the image - meaning that if there’s a CMD instruction in the Dockerfile, it will be ignored.
However this doesn't seem true in practice.
Edit: This isn't true only if the input to entrypoint is empty ([], "").
Bug setup
Make the following dockerfile tag with echo and make the following docker-compose.yml file.
Dockerfile
From python:3

ENTRYPOINT [ "echo", "garbage" ]
CMD [ "echo", "hi" ]
Build the image with tag echo docker build -t echo ..
docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  echo:
    image: echo
    entrypoint: ""
Expected results
That both the ENTRYPOINT and CMD are wiped when bringing up the docker-compose.yml.
Actual result
The CMD is still used.
Execution with actual result
$ docker-compose up

The entrypoint is being removed, but the CMD of echo hi is still being run on this line echo_1 | hi.
If we comment out the entrypoint in the docker-compose.yml we get the expected result of entrypoint(echo garbage) cmd(echo hi) -> garbage echo hi
