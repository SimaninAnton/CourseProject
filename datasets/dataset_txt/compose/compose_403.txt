I have a problem where by running docker-compose up invariably gives me a timeout error as such
ERROR: for test HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=2375): Read timed out. (read timeout=60)
ERROR: compose.cli.errors.log_timeout_error: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
I can't replicate this reliably and cant fix this either.
I am running the docker-compose through powershell and as suggested in other issues I try something like
$env:HTTP_COMPOSE_TIMEOUT = 300
but the problem persists and it still tells me that current value of timeout is 60
Can I please get some clarity, as to whether I am using this incorrectly or is there a bug with docker-compose somewhere
