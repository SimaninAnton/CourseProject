Hi, I am running:
OSX Yosemite (Macbook Pro)
docker-compose version 1.6.2, build 4d72027
Docker version 1.10.3, build 20f81dd
docker-machine version 0.6.0, build e27fb87
My project is under the Users directory (/Users/gavin/myproject).
I have a Docker-compose.yaml file like the below. Note that I've made three separate attempts at mounting the volume:
manager:
  build: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-manager
  volumes:
    - /Users/gavin/myproject:/opt/one
    - .:/opt/two
    - ~/myproject:/opt/three
My Dockerfile-manager looks like:
FROM node:argon
RUN ls -al /opt
When I run this, I get:
$ docker-compose build
Building manager
Step 1 : FROM node:argon
 ---> 4e2e99ae7d3e
Step 2 : RUN ls -al /opt
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 5734b5039cd2
Successfully built 5734b5039cd2
So this shows that the volume has not been mounted on /opt/one, /opt/two or /opt/three. I would expect to see these directories available, unless I've misunderstood the docs.
When I SSH into the docker machine, I see that it can see the files just fine:
$ docker-machine ssh
Boot2Docker version 1.10.3, build master : 625117e - Thu Mar 10 22:09:02 UTC 2016
Docker version 1.10.3, build 20f81dd
docker@default:~$ cd /Users/gavin/myproject/
docker@default:/Users/gavin/myproject$ ls -al
drwxr-xr-x    1 docker   staff          816 Mar 24 16:04 ./
drwxr-xr-x    1 docker   staff         3196 Mar 24 16:06 ../
-rw-r--r--    1 docker   staff           32 Mar 24 16:04 Dockerfile-manager
-rw-r--r--    1 docker   staff          139 Mar 24 16:03 docker-compose.yml
docker@default:/Users/gavin/myproject$
So, this means that the files are available to Docker machine, but are not being made available to the container.
I am brand new to Docker, so it's likely I'm doing something wrong - can anyone help?
