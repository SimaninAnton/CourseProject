Fig's documentation indicated "if there are existing containers for a service, fig up will stop and recreate them.." in order to process changes applied to the application's YML, for example, to add another component. What are your thoughts on permitting dynamic application composition such that a new container with a desired service can be added to the existing cooperative network of docker containers that comprise the applicaion without having to conceptually "restart" the entire network? It seems to me that fig's operation/design focuses on statically defining the image and bindings between cooperative containers defined by images. This certainly helps my effort as my application statically relies on a certain mix of containers, but once it my application is running, I'd like to dynamically extend or contract the application's feature set.
