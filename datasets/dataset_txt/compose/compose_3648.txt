Currently the docker-compose ps command is limiting from a trouble shooting perspective. Here are a few suggestions...
There should be a --no-wrap option or move to the ps model using --no-trunc. IMHO the ascetics of the wrapping column output are not much better than a full line wrap output. The former makes it hard for a debugger where they need to cut and paste parts of the output.
The short CID should be in the default ps output.
Some additional meta might be nice (e.g., up time and image name). Otherwise the user's might be straddling between the docker ps and the docker-compose ps commands...
Some more meta
