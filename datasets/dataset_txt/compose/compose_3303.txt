'command' - works inside a container composer definition currently and from what I understand overrides the default cmd
Can you also pull it back out to the top level or host level?
This would allow scenarios that currently have to be managed outside of docker-compose.
e,g,
couchbase1:
container_name: couchbase1
image: couchbase/server:community-3.0.1
volumes:
- /opt/couchbase/node1:/opt/couchbase/var
net: none
command: pipework add br1 couchbase 192.168.1.1@192.168.1.254
That would of course make command a keyword at the top level, but that's a small sacrifice and should be fairly easy to implement.
Unless someone has a better idea.
