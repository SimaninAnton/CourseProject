Running docker-compose down a second time should be a no-op, but it complains about the network having already been removed:
$ docker-compose down
Stopping app_web_1 ... done
Stopping app_redis_1 ... done
Removing app_web_1 ... done
Removing app_redis_1 ... done
Removing network app_default

$ docker-compose down
Removing network app_default
ERROR: network app_default not found
The same thing happens with volumes if you pass -v.
