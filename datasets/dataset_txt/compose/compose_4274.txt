Hi there, I'm a newbie here so don't be hard :).
I've installed docker and I followed the fig wp installation instructions but seems that I can't have a wp running. This is what I have:
docker
Client version: v1.1.1
Git commit: 8dd1935
fig 0.5.1
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2375

I've tried with http://192.168.59.103:8000/, http://192.168.59.103:8000/code, http://192.168.59.103:8000/example, but doesn't work.
Any clue?
Thanks!!
