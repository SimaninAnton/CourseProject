Hi,
I am testing restart policy for my container through docker-compose.
I have explicitly given exit in my golang code with exit code -1.
When Url for service is called then exit code is encountered and application is stopped.
After this container is restarted with restart policy used "unless-stopped".
When I am executing this, my docker-compose gives
dockerapp_buylead_1 exited with code 255
and exits.
But container is restarted.
So container keeps running in background.
Why does docker-compose exit if container is running?
Please help out with this issue.
My docker-compose.yml is:
version: '3'
services:
buylead:
build:
context: ./blDocker/
dockerfile: Dockerfile
ports:
- "7083:7083"
restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
- /home/nupur/dev-mapi-go/src/DockerApp/blDocker/log/:/home/nupur/dev-mapi-go/src/DockerApp/blDocker/log/
