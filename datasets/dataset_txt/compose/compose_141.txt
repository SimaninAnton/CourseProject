Description of the issue
When you view https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/compose the suggested pull command is
docker pull docker/compose
This fails with the message:
$ docker pull docker/compose
Using default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: manifest for docker/compose:latest not found
Presumably because there is no :latest defined.
Context information (for bug reports)
Ran on Ubuntu, see above for more details.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Run docker pull docker/compose on a machine without the image already installed
Observed result
Using the default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: manifest for docker/compose:latest not found
Expected result
Something similar to
$ docker pull docker
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/docker
Digest: sha256:38874a2f8d1c33b51b7e2c629630f54ec32f1fe4aed91133db9da771029e2947
Status: Image is up to date for docker:latest
Additional information
I would guess a version needs tagged or the website reference prompting the non-working command needs to be removed.
