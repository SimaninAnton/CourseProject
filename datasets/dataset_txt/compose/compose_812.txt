With the new 1.20.0-rc1, it is not possible to extend a service that contains a security_opt.
Steps to reproduce
I have two compose files, one that has seccomp settings and one that extends the service with seccomp settings (other.yml):
version: '2.1'

services:
  hello:
    security_opt: ['apparmor:unconfined', 'seccomp:unconfined']
And then the service that extends it (docker-compose.yml):
version: '2.1'

services:
  test:
    image: debian:stretch
    extends:
      file: other.yml
      service: hello
Next, use docker-compose up or docker-compose config to reproduce the issue:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.20.0-rc1, build 86428af
$ docker-compose up
Recreating testsalt_test_1 ... error

ERROR: for testsalt_test_1  Cannot create container for service test: invalid --security-opt 2: "SecurityOpt(value='apparmor:unconfined', src_file=None)"

ERROR: for test  Cannot create container for service test: invalid --security-opt 2: "SecurityOpt(value='apparmor:unconfined', src_file=None)"
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
$ docker-compose config
services:
  test:
    image: debian:stretch
    security_opt:
    - SecurityOpt(value='apparmor:unconfined', src_file=None)
    - SecurityOpt(value='seccomp:unconfined', src_file=None)
version: '2.1'
$ 
Note that the SecurityOpt appear to be a python representation of the object and not the literal value.
Expected results
This should work correctly like it does with 1.19.0-rc1:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.19.0, build 9e633ef
$ docker-compose up
Starting testsalt_test_1 ... done
Attaching to testsalt_test_1
testsalt_test_1 exited with code 0
$ docker-compose config
services:
  test:
    image: debian:stretch
    security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined
    - seccomp:unconfined
version: '2.1'
$
Other notes
This issue does not occur if the service is not extending another service. It must be a service that extends another one:
$ cat docker-compose.yml 
version: '2.1'

services:
  test:
    image: debian:stretch
    security_opt: ['apparmor:unconfined', 'seccomp:unconfined']
$ docker-compose config
services:
  test:
    image: debian:stretch
    security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined
    - seccomp:unconfined
version: '2.1'
