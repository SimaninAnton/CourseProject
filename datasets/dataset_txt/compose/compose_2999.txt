I recently updated to docker-compose 1.5.2. Currently when I docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d my newly created containers use old images named "image_name" instead of the the newer images named "/image_name".
For some containers I have deleted the old "image_name" but some of the containers are data containers and I dont' want to lose the data.
Any help is appreciated. I'd like docker-compose to use the latest images available.
