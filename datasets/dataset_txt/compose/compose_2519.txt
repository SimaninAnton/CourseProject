In development I often fiddle with my docker compose .yml files, disabling and reenabling entire sections.
The only way to do this in a .yml file appears to be to add a gate (#) at the begin of each line, which is fairly laborious.
I'd love to be able to just put disabled: true at the top of the section instead.
