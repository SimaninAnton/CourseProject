Say we have a docker-compose.yml contains the $ sign, and it should be escaped, like:
version: '3.3'
services:
  exporter:
    image: prom/node-exporter
    command:
      - -option_without_quote=$$
      - '-option_single_quote=$$'
      - "-option_double_quote=$$"
However, when using docker-compose config to show this file, the $ sign are not escaped anymore:
$ docker-compose -f sample.yml config
services:
  exporter:
    command:
    - -option_without_quote=$
    - -option_single_quote=$
    - -option_double_quote=$
    image: prom/node-exporter
version: '3.3'
This will cause the problem when the output will be used in docker stack deploy case, as following error will be raised:
Invalid interpolation format for "command" option in services "exporter": "-option_without_quote=$". You may need to escape any $ with another $.
