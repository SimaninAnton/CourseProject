I suddenly got this issue, after my settings had been working for weeks (Fedora 24, x86_64).
I don't remember any change on the compose configuration that could explain it:
% docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 6c29830

% sudo docker-compose up             
Starting pythdb
Creating pythweb

ERROR: for pythweb  no such file or directory
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/bin/docker-compose", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('docker-compose==1.7.1', 'console_scripts', 'docker-compose')()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/compose/cli/main.py", line 63, in main
    log.error(e.msg)
AttributeError: 'ProjectError' object has no attribute 'msg'
Moreover, this error message is totally cryptic.
