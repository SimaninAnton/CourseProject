I think that docker-compose run <service> should bring up the dependencies of that service, the same as docker-compose up <service> would. There is already the --no-deps flag for run, which implies that the default behavior is to bring up dependencies.
If this is the intended behavior, then I am not seeing it. If I have a docker-compose.yml file like this:
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: postgres
    command: sh -c 'psql -h db -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -c "\list"'
    entrypoint: /tmp/entrypoint.sh
    volumes:
      - ./entrypoint.sh:/tmp/entrypoint.sh
    depends_on:
       - db
  db:
    image: postgres
Then running docker-compose run web won't bring up the db container.
