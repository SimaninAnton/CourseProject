Hi,
I have an application composed of www / api / db parts in docker-compose.yml file.
On a regular basis (once a day), I need to have an additional container that needs to run, perform a single task and then goes down.
What about having some kind of configuration in the docker-compose file, like the following one to have a container based on myimage run (with -rm command) every day at 00:00 ?
project:
  image: myimage
  crontab: 0 0 * * *
