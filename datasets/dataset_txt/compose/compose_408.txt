I installed docker at my raspberry pi zero w running the latest raspbian with
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
and docker-compose with
sudo pip install docker-compose
When I run docker-compose in my raspberry:
    sudo docker-compose up
    ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost - is it running?
    
    If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
When I do sudo dockerd:
    sudo dockerd
    Segmentation fault
It seems that the docker daemon is not working because of the Segmentation Fault. What should I do?
sudo dockerd
gives me
Segmentation fault
so my problem is that the docker daemon isn't running, but I don't know what I should do
