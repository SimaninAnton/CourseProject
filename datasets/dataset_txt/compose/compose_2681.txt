I want to say sorry that I didn't look into better place to say that, but I hope it will work out :)
I think that compose install instructions can be made more clear --- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
instead of talking about sudo -i and exit what if you would just use these commands:
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.6.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > docker-compose
$ chmod +x docker-compose
$ sudo mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
