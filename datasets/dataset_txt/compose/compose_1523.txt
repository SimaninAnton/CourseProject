Hi folks!
I am very sorry, I am not deep down into docker development and I am just learning about the whole docker world. Maybe I am just missing an obvious option. But in order to build on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 3 I need the following patch to Dockerfile
diff --git Dockerfile Dockerfile
index a03e151..028277a 100644
--- Dockerfile
+++ Dockerfile
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-FROM debian:wheezy
+FROM armhf/debian:latest

 RUN set -ex; \
     apt-get update -qq; \
If there is an option I am missing here please point me to that option and close the issue.
Best, Daniel
