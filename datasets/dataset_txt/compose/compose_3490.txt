Hello
How can we define --memory-swap in docker-compose.yml?
I am getting this error Unsupported config option for "" service: 'memory-swap'
I have to define all these options also:
-m, --memory="": Memory limit (format: , where unit = b, k, m or g)
-memory-swap="": Total memory limit (memory + swap, format: , where unit = b, k, m or g)
-c, --cpu-shares=0: CPU shares (relative weight)
--cpu-period=0: Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period
--cpuset-cpus="": CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
--cpuset-mems="": Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.
--cpu-quota=0: Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota
--blkio-weight=0: Block IO weight (relative weight) accepts a weight value between 10 and 1000.
--oom-kill-disable=true|false: Whether to disable OOM Killer for the container or not.
Thanks in advance.
