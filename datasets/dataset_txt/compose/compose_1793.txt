I have a setup where I setup the "main" docker-compose.yml and then override per environment with docker-compose.dev.yml, docker-compose.prod.yml, etc. There's a warning which gets cast, but it's not valid so please consider fixing it.
Say I have
# f1.yml
version: '2.1'
services:
  test:
    image: hello-world
    environment:
    - MY_VAR="${MY_VAR}"
and
# f2.yml
version: '2.1'
services:
  test:
    environment:
    - MY_VAR="specified"
If I run docker-compose -f f1.yml -f f2.yml up, I get WARNING: The MY_VAR variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string. which is not true as the container indeed gets the value specified in f2.yml.
As this is currently the only way (I know of) to have env-specific configuration, it would be great if the warning was not cast improperly as it needlessly confuses.
