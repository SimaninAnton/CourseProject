Given the following docker-compose:
version: "2"

services:

  maven:
    image: maven:3.5-jdk-8
    command: "ls "
    network_mode: "none"

  http:
    image: http
    command: "ls "
Running docker-compose -p toto run --rm maven ls is creating a network Creating network "toto_default" with the default driver.
Issue: docker-compose should not create a network when running a container that has no network!
Note: I can see a network is not created if all containers have network_mode: "none"
