I'm running a django server via fig for local development. I'd like to integrate a command line driven proxy server that handles live reloads (browser-sync).
Current solution is run the fig cluster, then locally open a new terminal and run browser-sync start --proxy localhost:8000, and then navigate to the url that browser-sync gives me (localhost:3000).
What I'd really like to do is have fig handle this proxy redirect internally by mapping a single url and runing two TTY's within the web instance.
I prose supporting this syntax in the fig.yml:
db:
image: mdillon/postgis:9.3
web:
environment:
DATABASE_URL: postgis://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/myproject
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: myproject.settings.local
build: .
command:
- python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
- browser-sync start --port 8000 --proxy localhost:8001
volumes:
- .:/code
ports:
- "8000:8000"
links:
- db
I'd be happy to work on a patch if it seems like a good idea
