docker-compose logs do not keep colored output when writing through a pipe. It's easy to see. Just run docker-compose logs | cat and the colors are gone.
This is generally a good default, however sometimes you want to keep the colors, including the prefix generated by docker-compose and the colors within the applicative logs themselves. It would be nice to have a --colors option to force keeping the colors in that case.
