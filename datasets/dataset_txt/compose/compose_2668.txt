I tried docker compose up with this config:
version: '2'

services:
  beh-myodoo-$SUFFIX:
    build: beh-myodoo
    ports:
     - "$PORT:$PORT"
    links:
     - beh-db-$SUFFIX:db

  beh-db-$SUFFIX:
    image: postgres:9.4
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: odoo
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: odoo
However that doesn't seem to work:
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
Invalid service name 'beh-myodoo-${SUFFIX}' - only [a-zA-Z0-9\._\-] characters are allowed
I think variable substitution should work there as well.
