Hi,
What do you think about the ability to add env_files with regexp?
Example:
pepe:
    image: pepe
    volumes:
      - mongo_data_dev:/data/db
    env_file:
      - .env.development
      - .env.development.*
It should match with the files .env.development and for example env.development.customized
Thanks
