Hi,
For our container we have the home directory configured as volume, ie;
container:
    volumes:
        - "./www:/var/www"
/var/www is the user's home directory within the container.
I noticed each time I stop/rm/up the container the .bashrc file is reset to some system-default file. If I create a new file in this volume it stays persisted.
Fairly new to docker.. so perhaps i'm overlooking something?
