Lately I've been noticing the following error message quite frequently with docker-compose up:
ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
Increasing the COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT only seems to delay the error. Is this a known issue and/or is there a workaround for this?
I'm using ubuntu 16.04, please find below the output of docker-compose version and docker version. I'd also like to note that I see this issue with docker for mac beta, docker-machine, etc.
