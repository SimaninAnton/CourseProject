Hi!
Could someone explain why I'm getting this error?
The compose section for the container:
MongoConnector:
build: ./conf/mongoconnector/
links:
- es
- MongoDB
command: mongo-connector -m MongoDB:27017 -t es:9200 -d elastic_doc_manager
The Dockerfile at ./conf/mongoconnector/
FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER Garito garito@gmail.com
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y install python
RUN apt-get -y install python-pip
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app/
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file at ./conf/mongoconnector:
mongo-connector
It seems to try to use image instead of build?
