Issue
Currently we can support multiple compose files using -f switch in the following way:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.stack1.yml -f docker-compose.stack2.yml <command>
In case a service requires many other stacks, each command may get very long.
Suggestion
Instead of accepting a single filename per -f switch, allow passing multiple filenames. This will allow us to use * matches. Example:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.*.yml <command>
