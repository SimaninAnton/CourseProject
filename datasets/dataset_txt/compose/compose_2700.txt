When running on swarm and trying to recreate containers, I get this error:
Recreating 74d03893fd_74d03893fd_flagshipcutter_forever_1
ERROR: unable to find a node with port 6713 available
Instead of trying to recreate the container, allow specifying a container to start as an intermediary between stopping, destroying and restarting.
In other words, instead of this oversimplified example:
docker run -p ${external_port}:${internal_port} --volumes-from ${original_container} --name ${new_container_name} ${new_image}
docker rm -f ${original_container}
It would be
docker run --volumes-from ${original_container} --name ${intermediary_name} ${intermediary_image}
docker rm -f ${original_container}
docker run -p ${external_port}:${internal_port} --volumes-from ${intermediary_name} --name ${new_container_name} ${new_image}
This way, downtime would be hugely minimised instead of stopping all services that may be at a specific scale before being able to bring them back up.
The intermediate container could be something very small (it just has to hold files) or it could be specified in the docker-compose.yml
