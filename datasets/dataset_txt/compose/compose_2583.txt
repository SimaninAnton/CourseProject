I have following dockerfile with following image name "deleteHelloworld_cpp:v1:"
services: 
  service1: 
    build: "."
    image: "deleteHelloworld_cpp:v1"
    expose:
      - "8083"
    ports: 
      - "8083:8083"
version: "2"
This causes:
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
but then if I change the image name to lowercase it works perfectly fine.
