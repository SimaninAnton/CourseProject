Description of the issue
Chrome needs to be manually connected to socket (by opening localhost) and Chrome does not close correctly when using Karma with Docker.

Observed result
Running docker-compose -f docker-compose_frontend-tests up yields this when the script starts:

The "connected on socket" line happens when I go into Chrome and open localhost:9876. Is this what I am supposed to do? Does Docker not automatically connect to the server?
Also, once all 1241 tests are successfully completed, Chrome seems to be killed abruptly. Is there any way to fix this?
Expected result
Socket on localhost:9876 should be connected to automatically, without needing to manually go into Chrome and open localhost.
The script should go to completion and Chrome shouldn't be abruptly killed.
