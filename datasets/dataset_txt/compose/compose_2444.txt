I bring up two containers called master and slave where slave depends_on master. I destroy master. I then run docker-compose up and both slave and master are recreated even though nothing has changed about slave.
/ $ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.7.0, build 0d7bf73
/ $ docker -v
Docker version 1.11.1, build 5604cbe
