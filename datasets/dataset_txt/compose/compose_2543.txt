What I do
View logs of a service with docker-compose logs --follow
Scale up service (e.g. from 1 to 2)
Scale down service (e.g. from 2 to 1)
Scale up again (e.g. from 1 to 3)
What I expect to see
Compose streams logs of service instance 1
... then instances 1+2
... then instance 1 only (possibly with a message telling me that instance 2 is gone)
... the instances 1+2+3
What I see instead
Compose streams logs of service instance 1
... then instances 1+2
... then, when scaling down, I get the following traceback:

Compose then only displays logs for instance 1 and doesn't display other instances, even if I scale back up
Extra info
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.7.0rc1, build 1ad8866
To reproduce:
git clone git://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop
cd orchestration-workshop/dockercoins
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs --tail 1 --follow worker
# in another terminal ...
docker-compose scale worker=2
docker-compose scale worker=1
docker-compose scale worker=3
docker-compose down
