Using using docker-compose v1.5.2 under Windows and cygwin, when I run docker-compose pull I get the error:
{ MioEvents }  Â» docker-compose pull
Pulling mongodb (mongo:latest)...

Authentication is required.
I've registered with my private registry and it works fine under CMD. I've tried making a symlink ~/.docker to C:\Users\nick.smith\.docker but it still doesn't work.
Any ideas?
Thanks
