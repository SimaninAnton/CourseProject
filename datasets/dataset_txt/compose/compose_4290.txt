I have a fig.yml and an app directory that contains a Dockerfile. It complains that the Gemfile doesn't exist.
## file tree
- app_dir/
  - Dockerfile
  - app.rb
  - Gemfile
- fig.yml
## fig.yml

app:
  build: app_dir
  command: ruby app.rb
  volumes:
    - app_dir/:/deploy
## app_dir/Dockerfile

FROM <some image that contains ruby + bundler>
VOLUME ["/deploy"]
WORKDIR /deploy
RUN bundle install
Doing a RUN echo $(ls) inside the Dockerfile shows that the directory doesn't contain anything.
But doing a fig run and checking the /deploy directory shows that the files mounted from the host are there.
Am I doing something wrong?
