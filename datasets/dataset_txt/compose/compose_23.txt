Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
After doing "docker-compose run app bundle install" it adds gems in cached way, but if I need to run the app it does not work. I need to rebuild the image, which installs gems in non-cached way. can you figure out an alternative solution for this, to fasten the build process.
Describe the solution you'd like
Reduce bundle install process time by not rebuilding the image again.
Describe alternatives you've considered
docker-compose run app bundle install
docker-compose build
