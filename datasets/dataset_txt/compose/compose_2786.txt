I'm having an issue using rexray driver with docker-compose 1.6.
I have following very simple file:
version: "2"
services:
  mysql:
    image: sameersbn/mysql:latest
    volumes:
      - mydata:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mydata:
    driver: "rexray"
    driver_opts:
      volumetype: "gp2"
      size: 5
Given that file I suppose, that DE will create volume with Rexray volume driver?
But really volume is created with 'local' driver instead.
And I even can enter any string as driver parameter, and volume will be created with 'local' driver.
But if I describe volume as external, provided existing rexray volume name, it will be successfully created and mounted.
Is it a bug or I'm doing something wrong?
