 Experimental: false
Steps to reproduce the issue
Have docker-compose.yml with around ~50 services defined like the one below:
version: '3'
services:
  flask:
    image: app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - ./some/path:/storage
    networks:
      - dev
      - test
    env_file:
      - .env
      - .dev
    restart: on-failure
    command: ./run.py
    depends_on:
      - nginx
      - mysql
Observed result
Latest development and stable versions of docker-compose are opening and parsing the following files for each defined service separately:
.env
.dev
config_schema_v3.0.json
This results in each of those files being read and parsed 50 times. The results are worse for version 2 of docker-compose file, when using extends.
Expected result
docker-compose should read each of the files only once. When I added caching of output of load_jsonschema / env_vars_from_file / load_yaml functions, it resulted in 4 times faster execution of docker-compose ps (it was reduced from 8 to 2 seconds).
