Arch Linux updated its docker-compose version to 1.19.0, and the Docker Python SDK to 3.0.1.
However, the commits bumping docker-compose to use 3.0.x didn't make it into 1.19.0, even though they happened before the version tag. (See: 1.19.0...master)
This leads to errors like the following using the latest stable releases:

TypeError: build() got an unexpected keyword argument 'stream'
Since #5631 removed the stream argument, which needs to be gone for 3.0.x to work.
Was this intended?
