Hello,
I am in this situation where I want to run one of the image as a part of docker-compose, but that image should do it work and then exit. But as soon as that container exits the whole composition is taken down.
Is there a way to allow running containers which are allowed to exit from a composition once the work is done?
Regards,
Tarun
