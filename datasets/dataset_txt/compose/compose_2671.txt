The Compose File Reference documents both version 1 and 2 of the file format simultaneously. This makes for a very confusing read.
Only the current version should be documented at Compose File Reference. Previous versions should be handled like other Docker docs (e.g. Docker 1.9).
If the intention behind having both version 1 and 2 in the same doc is to help people upgrade their files, I think that use case would be much better served by a dedicated migration guide.
Keep up the good work all. It's great to see Compose progressing!
