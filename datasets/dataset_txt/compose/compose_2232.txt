it might be totally my fault,
but a couple of fairly obvious syntax to retrieve a passed-in array is failing with an "Invalid interpolation format" error.
In the doc it says that arrays are supported. In my case, being tricky, I need to make use of the associative array (bash > v4)
Any hope for me?
thank you
