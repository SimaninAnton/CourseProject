Hi
I am thinking about using fig which seems a really nice tool but my build is pretty complex and I would like to know what do you think about it.
I have three Dockerfile: database (db), application (app) and data.
Before to start my app I first need to init the data container:
run data container
call init script from db (which will populate data)
call start script from db
call init script from app (which will populate data through db)
Once these steps are done, data is initialized and I won't need to re run these steps only if I want to start from scratch.
The next step is to start the app:
run data container (or recreate it with a backup archive)
call start script from db
call start script from app
I also have small backup script which consist in archiving and compressing /data in data.
So I guess here I need to use two fig files (or three if I add the backup script) but I don't know how to handle the fact that data container from init step need to be kept for the start step.
I am currently using a Makefile to handle this but it's messy and I really would like to use a tool like fig. My application is here : https://github.com/hadim/docker-omero, if you want to have a look.
Hope I am clear enough and apologize in advance if this thread is not exactly an "issue" but I didn't find any mailing list.
Thanks you
