I have following images on local:
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                     TAG                 IMAGE ID               CREATED             SIZE
my_image_1                     latest              1c0884e42164           6 days ago          1.71 GB
my_image_2                     latest              6cec1ff6d070           3 weeks ago         914 MB
And docker-compose.yml as below:
back:
  image: 1c0884e42164
# ...
front:
  image: 6cec1ff6d070
# ...
After I run docker-compose bundle, compose failed to use the images saying the images are missing digests.
$ docker-compose bundle
ERROR: Some images are missing digests.

The following images need to be pulled:

    back
    front

Use `docker-compose pull back front` to pull them.
The problem occurs only with locally built images.
