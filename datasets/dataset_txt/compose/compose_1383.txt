This would add a feature similar to network_mode: service:svc_name for the pid field of a service configuration.
This feature would be supported for the following formats when using docker-compose: 2.1, 2.2, 3.0-3.3
Support for this feature when using docker stack is out of scope of this proposal.
Override: #4643
