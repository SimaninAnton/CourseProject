Dockerfile:
ADD bar /bar
fig.xml
foo:
  build: .
Note that ./bar is a directory.
Docker builds correctly:
$ docker build .
ADD bar /bar
Fig fails:
$ fig build
ADD bar /bar
Service 'foo' failed to build: bar: no such file or directory
Note that I'm running Fig installed via pip in a virtualenv (if that changes anything) but the same issue appears with the version installed via:
curl -L https://github.com/docker/fig/releases/download/1.0.1/fig-`uname -s`-`uname -m`
