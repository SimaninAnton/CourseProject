Hi,
Getting a 'not found' using the method mentioned in the docs for installing docker-compose. I have established the url being accessed is as follows:
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.19.0/docker-compose-Linux-armv7l
This url is not available on github, sorry if I have missed something.
