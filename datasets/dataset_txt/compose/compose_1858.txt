When using a different DOCKER_HOST, unless you set COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=0, any mount you specify on your docker-compose file will fail with:
ERROR: for db  Cannot create container for service db: create <volume>: "<volume>" includes invalid characters for a local volume name, only "[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]" are allowed
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
This is really confusing. This used to work fine before.
I am on 1.9.0 build 2585387.
DOCKER_HOST is set to a remote linux server.
Volumes is:
    volumes:
      - /opt/data/foo/html/:/var/www/html
Only works when COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=0 is set or when it is set to COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1. In other words, it only fails if COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS is unset.
On the 1.9.0 release you mention that:
When using Compose with Docker Toolbox/Machine on Windows, volume paths are no longer converted from C:\Users to /c/Users-style by default. To re-enable this conversion so that your volumes keep working, set the environment variable COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1. Users of Docker for Windows are not affected and do not need to set the variable.
The last part Users of Docker for Windows are not affected and do not need to set the variable is not true.
