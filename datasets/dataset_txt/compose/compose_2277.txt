The recently released beta can mount windows host directory using this test command
docker run --rm -v c:/Users:/data alpine ls /data
However, it is not working when used in compose under the volumes key:
 alpine:
   image: alpine
 volumes:
       - c:/Users:/data
We get this error instead
C:\> docker-compose run alpine ls /data
ERROR: Named volume " c:/Users" is used in service "alpine" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.  
Workaround
volumes:
     - $PROJECT_PATH:/data

PROJECT_PATH=/c/Users docker-compose run alpine ls /data
