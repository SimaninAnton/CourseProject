Maybe this is a bug, maybe I'm just holding it wrong... But for me it seems to make a difference to use fig up or fig run even if there is just one container. See this example:
asmaps@asmaps-x240 ~/git/morgana (git)-[master] % cat fig.yml
morgana:
  build: .
  command: "grunt watch"
  volumes:
    - app:/opt/morgana/app
    - dist:/opt/morgana/dist

asmaps@asmaps-x240 ~/git/morgana (git)-[master] % fig up

How is it possible that it works with fig up but raises an error on fig up? Afaik the 2 commands should do the same if there is just one container...
