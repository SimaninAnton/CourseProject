Hello.
I'm trying to auto-generate docker-compose config file from several unrelated microservices. Unfortunately, this fails because of incorrect build context path in resulting file. Let me illustrate.
Suppose we have the following file tree:
$ tree
.
├── A
│   └── docker-compose.yml
└── B
    └── docker-compose.yml
with A/docker-compose.yml containing
version: '3'
services:
    a:
        build: .
and B/docker-compose.yml containing
version: '3'
services:
    b:
        build: .
Now let's check out docker-compose config output:
docker-compose -f A/docker-compose.yml -f B/docker-compose.yml config
services:
  a:
    build:
      context: /tmp/dc/A
  b:
    build:
      context: /tmp/dc/A
version: '3.0'
That is clearly incorrect, because build path for service b should be /tmp/dc/B in this particular case, but it is /tmp/dc/A instead - probably because a service was first in the command line.
Could this be fixed?..
