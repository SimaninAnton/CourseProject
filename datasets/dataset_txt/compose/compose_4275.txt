I'm using MacOS on network with a http proxy. Thus I often set the following env variables:
http_proxy=http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT
https_proxy=http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT
but when these envs variables are set fig does not work anymore (see stacktrace)

ps: I just edited the #HOST# #PORT# that matching the proxy host and port
ps1: All images are local
I don't really need proxy for fig/docker because I'm working with local image but It a bit annoying to unset env.
I think the program used proxy because it set, but maybe add some documentation to counter the problem, for example by adding env no_proxy= (but I need to find which http address I should add on no_proxy)
