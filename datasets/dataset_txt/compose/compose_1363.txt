I'm confused every time I do docker-compose up -d
postgres is up-to-date
nginx is up-to-date
Recreating backend
dashboard is up-to-date
The container name is always in front, just for "recreating" it's at the end. I wish you could unify this to make spotting what was recreated and what is up-to-date a bit easier.
