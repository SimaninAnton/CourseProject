I have some things that are maintenance related, e.g. database optimization or analysis.
I would like to be able to tell fig not to run them automatically during fig up but only when using fig run <app>.
Example:
maintenance:
  image: my-mysql
  link: db:mysql
  autostart: false

db:
  image: my-mysql
  ....
