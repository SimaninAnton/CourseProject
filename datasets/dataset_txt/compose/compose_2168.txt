Sometimes I see an annoying problem with processing multiple json objects, for example:
Exception in thread Thread-27:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.5.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/threading.py", line 914, in _bootstrap_inner

    decode=True
  File "/Users/pahaz/.virtualenvs/xxx/lib/python3.5/site-packages/docker/client.py", line 253, in _stream_helper
    data = json.loads(data)

    raise JSONDecodeError("Extra data", s, end)
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 655)
This problem is related with wrong event stream processing in docker-py.
More info here: docker/docker-py#1059 and docker/docker-py#1081
I know that this is not a problem of compose. But first of all I try to find any mentions about it here. And I did not find any mentions in issues.
If you also annoyed, you can use patch from there: docker/docker-py#1081
What do you think about add event stream preprocessing in compose for patching this problem?
I this than this is not so important if it will fixed in docker-py. But It may help now here and it may be helpful for people who freeze docker-py version.
