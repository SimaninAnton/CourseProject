I was wondering if it is possible to build docker images using docker-compose file with multiple tags?
version: '2.2'

services:
    foo:
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
            args:
                CT_TAG: 6.10
            labels:
                com.example.description: "Accounting webapp"
        image: foo:baz
        image: foo:bar
This will only tag the image as foo:bar and not foo:baz
