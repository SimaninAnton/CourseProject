Suppose I have the following config (simplified):
  src:
    build:
      context: deploy/src
    image: myname/base

  fpm:
    build:
      context: deploy/fpm
    image: myname/fpm
Dockerfile for fpm is located in deploy/fpm, Dockerfile for src is located in deploy/src
Dockerfile for myname/fpm image extends from myname/base image
FROM myname/base
Therefore I need to include both services (src & fpm), and make containers from them.
Is it possible to specify that src service is for build only.
So it first builds myname/base image and then myname/fpm image.
If I omit src it will not be able to find myname/base image since it was not build yet.
