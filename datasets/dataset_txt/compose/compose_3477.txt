Hi folks,
Consider the following docker-compose.yml
test:
    image: spacediver/python
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.180:80"
Notice the error in ports, originally I meant to say "127.0.0.1:80:80"
Trying to start it we may see (with docker 1.7.0, docker-compose 1.3.0) this:
root@17934123d4d1:~# docker-compose up                 
Creating root_test_1...
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
Why would this happen?
Running docker with -D reveals (http://pastebin.com/caDWGW8Q) that there's an exception in daemon that happens at parsing invalid ports directive ("127.0.0.180:80")
Trying to run the same with docker CLI would validate ports directive well before sending to daemon:
root@17934123d4d1:~# docker run --rm -ti -p 127.0.0.180:80 spacediver/python 
docker: Invalid hostPort: 127.0.0.180.
See 'docker run --help'.
I'm not pretty sure how to properly fix this, but it seems that docker-compose could probably validate ports directive not worse than docker CLI does?
