Hi
Where I should place the env_file if I run docker-compose from a subfolder?
if I place same folder as docker-compose.yml then I get warring message that "WARNING: The APP_ROOT variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string."
if I place the subfolder where I run the docker-compose command then I get error that "ERROR: Couldn't find env file: /home/xxxxx/xxxxx/xxxxx/.env"
if I place both folder (beside the docer-compose.yml and the subfolder) then working well
It is OK that the env_file must be present in two folder?
In the docker-compos file I use the following
env_file: .env
I try with docker-compose version 1.11.2, build dfed245 and docker-compose version 1.13.0-rc1, build 38af513
Sorry my bad Englis
Thaks
