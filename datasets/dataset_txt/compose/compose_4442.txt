Now Docker caches ADD in Dockerfiles, we can safely build on every fig up without builds taking ages.
There perhaps should also be an option in fig.yml to cache the build with a tag as it currently does. We should also document how to cache installation of code dependencies. E.g.:
ADD requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install -r /code/requirements.txt
ADD . /code/
This means pip install will only be run when requirements.txt changes. If pip install were after the last line, it would be run anytime any file changed.
