hello guys I have a question regarding running docker commands inside a docker-compose service, here's my docker-compose snippet:
services:

  logger:
    image: docker:17.06.0-ce
    volumes:
      - /tmp:/var/log
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

    command:
      - docker service ls


    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints: [node.role == manager]
but I get the following error:
Recreating logger_logger_1 ... done
Attaching to logger_logger_1
logger_1  | /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec: line 35: docker service ls: not found
logger_logger_1 exited with code 127
what am I missing ?
