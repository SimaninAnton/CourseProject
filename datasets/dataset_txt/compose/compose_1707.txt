Hi All,
I'm trying to set up an overlay network in docker-compose using consul as external key etc. I WAS getting the error "ERROR: error getting pools config from store: could not get pools config from store:" which mentioned ipam, so I added an ipam section in my network declaration and now I get this: "ERROR: Invalid subnet : invalid CIDR address:"
My config follows:
networks:
       workernet:
         driver: overlay
         ipam:
           driver: default
           config:
             - subnet: "192.168.0.0/24"
             - gateway: "192.168.0.1"
       default:
         driver: bridge
Could someone tell me where I've gone wrong and show me how this is supposed to work? I should mention that I've been working with and googling this for 3 days with no success.
Thanks in advance!
