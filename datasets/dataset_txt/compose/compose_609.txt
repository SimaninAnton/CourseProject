Description of the issue
I run docker-compose run myservice long-running-job.sh to start a container for my service. I would like to use tini (https://github.com/krallin/tini/) as pid 1 to avoid zombie problems.
That now has built-in support in docker run with the --init option.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#specify-an-init-process
Compose should also support this feature (and all other "docker run" options like --volume please).
# Run a subprocess reaper as pid 1 that starts long-running-jobs.sh
docker-compose run --init myservice long-running-job.sh
