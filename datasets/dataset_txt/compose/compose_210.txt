Description of the issue
As per v18.09 docs on .env files, I'm trying to set Docker Machine environment variables automatically by specifying them in a .env file (specificially DOCKER_CERT_PATH, DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY).
Some docker-compose commands work (up, down, ps, logs), but docker-compose run and docker-compose exec do not. Example:
>>> docker-compose exec nginx pwd
Error: No such container: a05e50bd3c2519b731c860e3c18176acd10feddfb7e48f795c4f065707c54501
The above error also occurs with docker-compose run. docker-compose ps -q confirms that a container with the specified hash is indeed running. Setting the environment variables with eval $(docker-machine env mymachine) fixes the issue, so it appears that some docker-compose commands are not reading environment variables from the .env file.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a Docker Machine (I've only tested AWS - not sure if other platforms are affected):
docker-machine create --driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-open-port 80 mymachine
Create a new directory with the .env files and docker-compose.yml files as specified above, updating the .env file with the DOCKER_* environment variables with the values outputted by docker-machine env mymachine
Run docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint pwd nginx
Observed result
Error: No such container: 7527e2716707fd058cf28622ee8229e0ca816454f43098ef49847857c02c0395
(the hash changes every time)
Expected result
/
(the output of running pwd inside the container)
Stacktrace / full error message
As shown above.
