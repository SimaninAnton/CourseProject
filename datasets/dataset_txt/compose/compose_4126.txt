Hello,
I want to use fig but there's a problem with port forwarding.
With pure docker you can forward an container application's port (e.g. 5000) to multiple host ports by writing:
docker run \
  -p 10.1.2.3:111:5000 \
  -p 10.1.2.3:222:5000 \
  myimage
This should create the two host ports 111 and 222 on the IP 10.1.2.3. Both forward to the container's port 5000.
When I write this piece of code in my fig.yml, only the 222 will be created:
    foo:
      image: myimage
      ports:
        - "10.1.2.3:111:5000"
        - "10.1.2.3:222:5000"
Is this by design or is this a bug?
