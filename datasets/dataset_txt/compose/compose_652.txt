Description of the issue
Would be nice to be able to tag images created by docker-compose build e.g.
# docker-compose.yml
...
services:
  frontend:
    build: .
$ docker-compose build frontend
$ docker-compose tag frontend mycompany/frontend:latest
Next, someone can use our image e.g.
docker container run -ti mycompany/frontend:latest
