I'm trying to get fig running on Mac OS X (Mountain Lion). My versions:
Python 2.7.2
pip 1.5.2 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-1.5.2-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
Vagrant 1.4.3
VirtualBox 4.3.7
When I try to do anything with fig, I get the following error:
$ fig
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/fig", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 2603, in <module>
    working_set.require(__requires__)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 666, in require
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 565, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)  # XXX put more info here
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: six>=1.3.0
I tried making sure that six is installed and it appears to be:
$ sudo pip install -U six
Requirement already up-to-date: six in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
I tried installing fig again:
$ sudo pip install -U fig
Requirement already up-to-date: fig in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
Requirement already up-to-date: docopt==0.6.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Requirement already up-to-date: PyYAML==3.10 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Requirement already up-to-date: requests==2.2.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Requirement already up-to-date: six>=1.3.0 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Requirement already up-to-date: texttable==0.8.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Requirement already up-to-date: websocket-client==0.11.0 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from fig)
Cleaning up...
six appears to be at the right version - in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages I'm seeing six-1.5.2.dist-info
Not sure where to go from here? Any ideas?
