I'm trying to use ENV variables declared in a .env file in my docker-compose file (I.e. I don't want to use the .env file in a container, just in the build process).
I have the following:
# file: build/docker-compose.development.yml

...
foo:
    volumes:
        - "${PROJECT_SRC}/foo.txt:/app/foo.txt"
# file: .env
PROJECT_SRC=../src
Then I run docker-compose:
$ docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.development.yml build
But no matter where I put the .env file (i.e. next to or inside the build directory) docker always throws:
WARNING: The PROJECT_SRC variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Am I doing something wrong? Or doesn't it work with the -f flag? Or?
