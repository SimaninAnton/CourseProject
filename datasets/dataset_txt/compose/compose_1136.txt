I'm running docker-compose in a docker based CI environment (definitely somewhat meta). I have it setup to connect to a remote host and deploy the configuration and code to it. However I'm getting stuck on an error with no error message. Command and output below:
docker-compose --verbose --skip-hostname-check build web
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: ./docker-compose.yml
docker.auth.find_config_file: Trying paths: ['/root/.docker/config.json', '/root/.dockercfg']
docker.auth.find_config_file: No config file found
Traceback (most recent call last):

I have environment variables for the command set:
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2376
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs
I'm running OpenSSL 1.0.2g and docker-compose 1.17.0-rc1
I'm guessing with the minimal environment that there may be some incompatibility or missing dependency but I'm not 100%. Any help here would be appreciated.
