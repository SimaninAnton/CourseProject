One nice thing of docker is that you can just run docker ps to list every container running on a certain machine.
While fig requires to be in a specific folder.
Is there a way to enable fig ps running on any folder?
Please, in case you plan it as feature, if you can address me on how to add this feature, I would be very glad to give an help.
