When building windows containers a compose file like:
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    links:
      - db
  db:
    image: mongo:3.2.9
with a docker file like:
FROM python:3.5

ENV APP_ROOT /code

WORKDIR ${APP_ROOT}
ADD ./requirements.txt ${APP_ROOT}/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

ADD . ${APP_ROOT}/

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver"]
The local volume is not shared with the container. Doing docker logs on the web container:
python: can't open file 'manage.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
When running docker-compose --verbose config
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: .\docker-compose.yml
networks: {}
services:
  db:
    image: mongo:3.2.9
  web:
    build:
      context: C:\Users\mic03\Projects\flaskbook\flaskbook_prj
    links:
    - db
    ports:
    - 5000:5000
    volumes:
    - /c/Users/mic03/Projects/flaskbook/flaskbook_prj:/code:rw
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
The command net share c confirm access has been granted to the drives:
PS C:\Users\mic03\Projects\flaskbook\flaskbook_prj> net share c
Share name        C
Path              C:\
Remark
Maximum users     No limit
Users
Caching           Caching disabled
Permission        DESKTOP-VFK5FP7\DockerHost, FULL

The command completed successfully.
Running the container without docker-compose is working. Any idea ?
