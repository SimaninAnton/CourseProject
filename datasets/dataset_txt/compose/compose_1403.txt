Ran into this "problem" while I was using docker-compose, and I'm sure someone else is bound to run into the same thing.
In one of my shells, I was trying to address an openssl/curl root chain CA bundle problem, so I set this environment variable
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem
After doing this, docker-compose started failing with:
ERROR: SSL error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:590)
This didn't impact the docker command, however, which continued to work just fine in that shell.
After seeing that other shells were not experiencing this same problem, I compared environments and ended up "fixing" my shell by running:
unset CURL_CA_BUNDLE
I hope this saves someone else the same headache.
