I have created a docker image using ubuntu trusty as the base.
The image is configured to run a Ruby application locally using the Ruby web server Thin.
Whenever I run docker-compose up I get the message in the subject constantly printing out along with stdout from the Ruby process.
This does not happen when I run a container from the save image using 'docker run'
Anyone got any ideas to fix this?
