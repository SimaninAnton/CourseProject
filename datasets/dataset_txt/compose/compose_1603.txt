I've been at this for weeks, and I'm assuming I'm overlooking something completely simple. I've created a Dockerfile that creates a Python:2.7 image, copies a few files and directories over, and also an nginx and MySQL image as well. Originally, I constructed a Dockerfile and a docker-compose file, ported my apps to use this setup, then deployed onto an AWS EC2 instance, no problems. At some point, my Django startup script was showing up as command not found. So, I tried to just rebuild everything, and while everything built successfully, I just had the same error. So Naturally, I double checked my configuration in production with my local and found everything to be exactly 1:1 with regards to my Dockerfile and docker-compose config.
The relevant part of my Dockerfile looks like this:
FROM python:2.7
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code
ADD environment.yml /code/
ADD requirements.txt /code/
ADD start_maxlabs.sh /code/
RUN chmod +x /code/start_maxlabs.sh
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y libmysqlclient-dev gunicorn 
RUN apt-get install -y libcairo2-dev 
RUN apt-get install -y libjpeg62-turbo-dev 
RUN apt-get install -y libpango1.0-dev
RUN apt-get install -y libgif-dev 
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential 
RUN apt-get install -y g++ 
RUN apt-get install -y python-imaging
RUN pip install -U pip
RUN pip install mysql-python
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ADD . /code/
ADD maxlabs /code/
ADD webapp /code/
My composer file looks like this:
  web:
    image: python:2.7
    container_name: maxlabs
    restart: always
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: /bin/bash /code/start_maxlabs.sh
After everything builds, and comes online, I see this message:
maxlabs exited with code 127
maxlabs | /bin/bash: /code/start_maxlabs.sh: No such file or directory
maxlabs | /bin/bash: /code/start_maxlabs.sh: No such file or directory
maxlabs | /bin/bash: /code/start_maxlabs.sh: No such file or directory
maxlabs | /bin/bash: /code/start_maxlabs.sh: No such file or directory
Indeed when I login to the container, there is no /code directory. Nothing has changed. My versioned copy in my repo of Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml hasn't changed.
If there's a better place to ask this, please let me know.
Thanks in advance!
