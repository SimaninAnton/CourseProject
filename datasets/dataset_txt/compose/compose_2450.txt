I started up a few services using Compose on my Mac and they appear to be running just fine. The services are, a Spring Boot application that is linked to a mock application, ActiveMQ, Mongo. I have been able to verify that the Spring Boot app connects to both the database and the activemq containers. For some reason though, when I run functional tests against the app container, it cannot connect to the mock application.
Here's a summary of how the apps connect and the error messages I am seeing:
    poc_service:
          build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
          links:
                    - activemq:amq
                    - mock:mock
                    - mongodb:mongodb
          environment:
                    - ws.url=http://mock:38080/services/MyService
So I am telling gradle to hit the poc_service and in fact do see that connection established. However, the poc_service is unable to reach the mock.
  poc_service_1   | ID: 1
  poc_service_1   | Address: http://mock:38080/services/MyService

  poc_service_1   | Http-Method: POST
  poc_service_1   | Content-Type: text/xml

  poc_service_1   | Payload: <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><soap:Body>...</soap:Body></soap:Envelope>
And the error is:
  poc_service_1   | org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault: Could not send Message.
  poc_service_1   |     at org.apache.cxf.interceptor.MessageSenderInterceptor$MessageSenderEndingInterceptor.handleMessage(MessageSenderInterceptor.java:64) ~[cxf-core-3.1.5.jar!/:3.1.5]

Any thoughts on why this is not connecting or how to debug this further?
