I have a docker-compose.yml file where multiple containers use the same image. When I call docker-compose pull the same image will be pulled multiple times. Is this really needed? The chances of a new version of that image being uploaded within the same pull process seems highly unlikely.
Example YML:
fpm:
    image: company/fpm
    container_name: fpm
    volumes:
        - /public:/var/www

ownersfpm:
    image: company/fpm
    container_name: ownersfpm
    volumes:
        - /owners:/var/www

partnersfpm:
    image: company/fpm
    container_name: partnersfpm
    volumes:
        - /partners:/var/www
And the pull string:
Pulling fpm (company/fpm)...
vagrant: Pulling from company/fpm
