Description of the issue
I expect to only see containers that publish port 19088, but instead I see all containers started by my compose file.
$ docker-compose ps --filter "publish=19088" 
...
example_test_1                      /bin/sh -c /start.sh       Up           4444/tcp, 5900/tcp, 6080/tcp, 80/tcp          
Regular docker ps works as expected:
$ docker ps --filter "publish=19088" 
c35a214eabc1        192.168.1.61:5000/example:latest   "/tini -g -- /configâ€¦"   21 minutes ago      Up 21 minutes       9001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5423->22/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5435->135/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5437->137/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5439->139/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5445->445/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5418->18088/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5419->19088/tcp   example_foo_1

Output of "docker-compose config"
Really need this?
Steps to reproduce the issue
Use compose to bring up services some that publish a port.
Try to list those services.
FYI I'm mainly needing this to list the containers for a service that were not started by a run. I guess is-task=false should work too?
Observed result
see above
Expected result
see above
Stacktrace / full error message
no error, just not able to filter containers from compose
(if applicable)
Additional information
OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
