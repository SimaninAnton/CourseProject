When trying to docker-compose up with ~20 services on Docker for Mac 1.11.1-beta11 I quite often get errors like the following:
ERROR: for ui  UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. (read timeout=60)

ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
and another docker-compose up results in
ERROR: for ui  argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 58, in main
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 109, in perform_command
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 734, in up
  File "compose/project.py", line 398, in up
  File "compose/parallel.py", line 60, in parallel_execute
TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable
The error is not limited to the ui service and hits different services in each up attempt.
The ui service itself:
$ docker ps -a | grep ui
1d57c16d2ad3  lab_ui    "node_modules/.bin/gu"   5 minutes ago       Created   lab_ui_1
$ docker inspect 1d57c16d2ad3

When starting the service manually using docker start 1d57c16d2ad3, the error disappears.
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
