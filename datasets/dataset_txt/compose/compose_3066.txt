I'm not sure if this really counts as an issue, just a quirk I noticed that makes it awkward to keep things in a single docker-compose.yml.
Say I have a docker-compose with 3 targets:
production:
    build: .

test:
    build: .
    links:
        -elasticsearch

elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:1.7.2
If the images aren't built, and I docker-compose run test, it will build test, elasticsearch, AND production, despite production not being a dep to run test. It's possible I'm missing a case where it matters that they're all built though, not sure.
Would be reasonably more efficient to not build unnecessary bits.
Separating config files is nice and all but makes command-line usage a lot more awkward. (Porque just bash alias...the answer to everything verbose on linux >.>)
