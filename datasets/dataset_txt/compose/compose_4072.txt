Currently when I start a container with fig the /etc/hosts file typically looks like this (with 172.17.0.61
as the IP-Address of the current container):
172.17.0.61 b2e3a12debf4
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.59 database
172.17.0.59 database_1
172.17.0.59 atlassian_database_1
It would be nice if there where the same predictable entries for the current container like the ones for the linked database container ... e.g.:
172.17.0.61 b2e3a12debf4
172.17.0.61     crowd
172.17.0.61     crowd_1
172.17.0.61     atlassian_crowd_
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.59 database
172.17.0.59 database_1
172.17.0.59 atlassian_database_1
EDIT: And maybe also set the hostname to the service name instead of the container id ...
