With :
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://myserver:2376/"
All docker command work (build, run), all docker-compose action who read from docker work (info).
But when an action is made (pulling, creating container) a POST request is done on //v1.21/... which is 301 moved permanently to /v1.21/... the POST is transformed to GET and a 404 Not Found is returned by docker.
Docker compose should remove the trailing slash as done by the docker client.
Docker compose might be more verbose on docker daemon error when run with --verbose
