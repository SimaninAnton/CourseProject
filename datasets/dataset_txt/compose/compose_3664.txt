When loading the bash completion, it's giving me the following errors:
$ . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
-bash: /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose: line 97: syntax error near unexpected token `('
-bash: /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose: line 97: `          _filedir y?(a)ml'
