Description of the issue
"OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" exception is raised when running docker-compose up command for Docker for Win while using the TCP connection to the Docker daemon.
This scenario, however unusual, though required for the Docker Compose integration in IntelliJ products 2018.1. Please see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-29185.
