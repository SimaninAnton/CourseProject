I would like to set a service environment variable, but using a value configured in other service.
I didn't find how to do it in the docs, so i'm putting here a sample of what I intend to do.
version: "2"
services:
    php:
        image: php:7-apache
        links:
            - mysql
        environment:
            DB_NAME: i_would_like_to_use_the_MYSQL_DATABASE_defined_in_mysql_service
    mysql:
        image: mysql:5
        environment:
            MYSQL_DATABASE: single_place_to_configure_the_db_name
Is there some way to do that? (I don't want to depend on the .env file)
