After upgrading the latest version of Docker for Windows 17.12.0-ce-win46 (15048), I wasn't able to start a container that was using a manually defined bind volume anymore.
The error was as follows:
ERROR: for project_fpm  Cannot create container for service fpm: error while mounting volume with options: type='none' device='/d/project/' o='bind': no such file or directory
After some investigation, I found out that the latest Docker version apparently prefixes the /host_mnt directory when creating a bound volume, so I've changed my docker-compose accordingly:
volumes:
  project-source:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: "/host_mnt/d/project/"
This looks like a BC break, and most likely docker-compose should do that transparently.
