Having the following sample docker-compose.yml
{ myproject }  » cat docker-compose.yml
version: '2.1'

services:
  myservice:
    build: /c/projects/myproject
I get the following error from docker-compose:
{ myproject }  » docker-compose config
ERROR: build path C:\c\projects\myproject either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.
Windows 10 Pro, Cygwin (Babun), docker-compose version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb
If the path is relative, then this does not matter. Unfortunately, I do need to use an absolute path in Linux notation (for cross-platform compatibility).
I'm using the same absolute Linux style paths with volume directives and they work just fine.
