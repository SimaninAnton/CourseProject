I recently found that docker compose creates entries in the hosts file for containers that are not supposed to be linked.
E.g. for this docker-compose.yml:
lb:
  image: eeacms/haproxy
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  links:
    - web
web:
  build: web
  ports:
    - "80"
  links:
    - rest
ci:
  build: ci
  ports:
    - "8888:80"
rest:
  build: java
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
load_test:
  build: load_test
  links:
    - lb:web
I get this hosts file inside of the lb container, which should only be linked to the web role, of which I have three instances:
172.17.0.173    13f3f32265f1
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.166    ci_1.bridge
172.17.0.169    web_2
172.17.0.173    dreamy_bhabha.bridge
172.17.0.166    ci_1
172.17.0.169    web_2.bridge
172.17.0.170    web_1
172.17.0.168    web_3
172.17.0.170    web_1.bridge
172.17.0.171    lb_1
172.17.0.167    rest_1
172.17.0.167    rest_1.bridge
172.17.0.168    web_3.bridge
172.17.0.171    lb_1.bridge
172.17.0.173    dreamy_bhabha
Again note that there are entries for each service defined in the docker-compose.yml despite the fact that the lb service should only be linked to the web service.
I can't imagine this is desired behavior, as it seems you should have to manually link every host.
