Looks like docker-compose doesn't properly parse DOCKER_HOST set to IPv6 address.
› env | grep DOCKER

DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/varankinv/.docker/machine/machines/os1f
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://[2001:6b8:1:10::10]:2376
DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=os1f
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

docker-compose returned -1
Related issue has been fixed in moby/moby#15557 and since version 1.10 docker works well with IPv6 addresses in DOCKER_HOST, while docker-compose doesn't.
