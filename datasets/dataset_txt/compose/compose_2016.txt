Hey!
According to the docs build should be able to be supplied as an object where context defines the path. Though I get the following error with the latest version of compose...
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
web.build contains an invalid type, it should be a string

$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build f3628c7
My docker-compose.yml file looks like this...
web:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile-dev
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  environment:
    ENV: dev
It seems like I am doing this correctly... Is this feature not in 1.8.0 by chance?
