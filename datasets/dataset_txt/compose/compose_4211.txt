Hey Guys,
I have 2 apps api and frontend, each of them in separated docker container.
Apps talk between each other using host names (api.my_app.com and frontend.my_app.com).
Containers have an internal network and an IP address and I can setup it in /etc/hosts on local via:
172.17.0.74 api.my_app.com
172.17.0.75 frontend.my_app.com
My problem is when the box restart (fig up --no-recreate) my container loses its IP, and i have to reset the url in /etc/hosts each time after fig up.
Is it possible to setup static IP address for container?
Thanks for any help.
