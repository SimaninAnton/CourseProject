When using Docker Compose on local with a v3 docker-compose.yml file that has a deploy key set in one of its services, we get the following warning emitting on a number of commands:
`WARNING: Some services (queue_crawler) use the 'deploy' key, which will be ignored. Compose does not support deploy configuration - use `docker stack deploy` to deploy to a swarm.
Is there a way to mute this warning?
Use cases
Dev/Prod parity
We are trying to use the YML file on local to communicate changes to the DevOps team which, at the moment, maintains a separate YML file. Having deploy declared at the development level is the perfect way for specifying these attributes such as the number of replicas to run. As a poor man's workaround right now we must use comments which DevOps reads and applies manually to the production configuration.
# Queue workers for crawlers. 3 workers are run in Production
Ad-hocs in Production
We get the same warning in production any time we run a cron. Our cron setup uses a docker-compose run command off the same file which docker stack deploy used so that we have consistency between the two behaviors.
At the moment we have no workaround for this. We get the warning output at the top of all of our cron runs, and it propagates into our log aggregator.
