It would be nice to have a release binary for ppc64le so that the installation instructions would work correctly on Ubuntu 18.04 on ppc64le.
Otherwise, maybe the instructions should be changed from:
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
to
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
with extra instructions for non-x86_64 systems.
