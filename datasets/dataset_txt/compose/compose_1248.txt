I try to test target option for 3.4 with
version: '3.4'
services:
  test:
    image: test
    build:
      context: .
      target: test
and got
ERROR: Version in "./docker-compose.yml" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
With '2.3' version it works
docker -v
Docker version 17.06.1-ce, build 874a737
docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.16.0-rc1, build 9bea70a
