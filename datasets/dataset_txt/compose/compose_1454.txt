given following docker-compose.yaml
version: "3"
services:
    sample:
        image: alpine
        environment:
            - USER_PASSWORD
            - ROOT_PASSWORD=${ROOT_PASSWORD:-$USER_PASSWORD}
        command: sh -c "env | sort | grep _PASSWORD"
Invocation of $ USER_PASSWORD='my own password' docker-compose run ends up with
Starting sample_sample_1 ... 
Starting sample_sample_1 ... done
Attaching to sample_sample_1
sample_1  | ROOT_PASSWORD=$USER_PASSWORD
sample_1  | USER_PASSWORD=my own password
Is there any way to make ROOT_PASSWORD inherit from USER_PASSWORD value?
