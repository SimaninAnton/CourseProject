I set COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to 300, but when it times out the error message says:
An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
I looked at the source on master and it appears to still be using the const HTTP_TIMEOUT in the message.
This is:
Docker version 1.11.2, build b9f10c9
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
