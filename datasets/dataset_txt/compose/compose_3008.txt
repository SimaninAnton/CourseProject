I recently described on Stackoverflow some confusion I have/had regarding the extending services feature of Docker Compose. As I note there, I was confused on whether all configuration files need to be added to all CLI commands. From what I can tell, they are needed. While this may seem obvious to some, I think it would be useful to explicitly state this in the documentation.
In the setup I describe on that Stackoverflow post, I was using docker-compose.yml to define my "base" setup and then override this with files like docker-compose.test.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml. It's easy to forget to specify the -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml on each command I run, thus getting potentially problematic commands run.
In the documentation, it might also be helpful to suggest an optional renaming of docker-compose.yml to docker-compose.base.yml if users want to avoid accidentally running Compose commands with the wrong configuration.
Let me know if I'm misunderstanding standing how things work or if I'm misunderstanding the intention of this feature.
Thanks!
