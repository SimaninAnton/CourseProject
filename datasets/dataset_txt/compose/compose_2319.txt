Hi,
I am using docker-compose v2 as such (edited for readability):
version: '2'
services:
  12345:
    image: yyyy/xxxx/12345
    labels:
      interlock.hostname: "aaaa"
      interlock.domain: "bbbb"
    ports:
      - "8080"
    restart: always
    networks:
     - center-network
    environment:
      - APP_OPTS=--mongo.address=12345-mongo
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m
      - constraint:application==12345
      - affinity:container!=/12345_*/
  12345-mongo:
    image: mongo:3.2
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    networks:
      - center-network
    environment:
      - constraint:application==12345
    volumes:/data/db


networks:
    center-network:
      driver: bridge
When I run docker-compose scale 12345=2, I get the below errors:
docker-compose up -d
Creating network "12345-center-network" with driver "bridge"
Creating 12345_1
Creating 12345-mongo_1

docker-compose scale 12345=2
Creating and starting 2 ... error

ERROR: for 2  network 12345-center-network not found
Is docker-compose scale usable with networks?
