compose doesn't seem to work with repos in docker hub, even when I am logged in to docker via docker login. is there another way I should be authenticating with docker hub to use private images with docker-compose?
Note: this is an example of me running docker-compose up with a compose.yml that has images in docker hub. dc is my alias for docker-compose.
~/canvas/devkit (master)$ dc -p cloud -f hub-compose.yml up

However, the very next command I run is a pull for that repository from docker hub and it succeeds.
~/canvas/devkit (master)$ docker pull usecanvas/api
