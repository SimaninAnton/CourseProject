I've set up a vagrant machine running windows server 2016, and set the DOCKER_HOST to point to that VM, and have configured docker-compose to use my external network, so I'm able to access the site that is running in the windows VM in my browser. The only piece I cannot get to work is mounting volumes, so changes from development on my mac are reflected in the windows container.
➜ docker-compose --version       
docker-compose version 1.9.0-rc2, build a2da43b
➜ docker version

services:

  site:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - .:/c/site
Maybe this isn't possible yet. I've tried a whole bunch of slightly different configs, including an absolute path to my current directory, just /site, and c:/site
I've also tried with just Docker, so maybe it would be better to post on docker/docker
➜ docker run --name mysite -d -p 80:80 -v .:/c/site site 
docker: Error response from daemon: invalid bind mount spec ".:/c/site": invalid volume specification: '.:\c\site'.
This would complete my development workflow on Mac for windows, so hopefully it is something I'm doing wrong!
