I have the following compose.yml:
hub:
  image: selenium/hub
  ports:
    - "4444:4444"
  volumes:
    - ~/webui-share:/var/webui-share
  environment:
    - GRID_TIMEOUT=500000
    - GRID_MAX_SESSION=50
    - GRID_BROWSER_TIMEOUT=600000

firefox:
  image: selenium/node-firefox
  links:
    - hub
chrome:
  image: selenium/node-chrome
  links:
    - hub
  volumes:
    - /dev/shm:/dev/shm
  volumes_from:
    - hub
I'd like to automate starting the grid as the CentOS machine starts up, either as a service or systemd. Here are the commands I run to startup the grid:
docker-compose -f docker_selenium_compose.yml up -d || true
docker-compose -f docker_selenium_compose.yml scale firefox=10 chrome=10 || true
