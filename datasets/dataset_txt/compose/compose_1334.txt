A similar question has been floating around stackoverflow and github. Yet, I am not able to solve this problem, I hope somebody can point me in the right direction.
lsb_release
Distributor ID: Debian
Release:        8.8
Codename:       jessie
docker-compose -v docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
docker -v Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be
/etc/environment
http_proxy=http://10.50.2.67:3128/
https_proxy=http://10.50.2.67:3128/
/etc/sudoers
...
Defaults        env_keep += "http_proxy"
Defaults        env_keep += "https_proxy"
...
In my docker compose, I'd like to pass both http_proxy and https_proxy as e vars.
...
web:
  environment:
    - http_proxy=$http_proxy
    - https_proxy=$https_proxy
on docker-compose up I get
WARNING: The http_proxy variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
I get the same error with any variables in env list.
What am I doing wrong?
