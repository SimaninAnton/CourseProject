I would be nice to have a description field in the services so that users can just read the docker-compose yml and understand what each service does. Something like this,
version: '2'
services:
   prodDBUI:
    description: To access the production db
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    environment:
     - PMA_ARBITRARY=1
   cleanImages:
    description: To cleanup artifacts left by docker
    image: pyros2097/web
    command: clean.sh
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
Right now I need to document what these services do in a separate readme.
