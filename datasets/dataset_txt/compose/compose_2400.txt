When I use docker-compose run, it seems that container_name paramter doesn't get used. Is this by design or a bug?
# cat docker-compose.yml
version: "2"

services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu
    command: /bin/bash
    container_name: c1
# docker-compose up -d
Creating network "docker_default" with the default driver
Creating c1
# docker-compose down
Removing c1 ... done
Removing network docker_default
# docker-compose run ubuntu
Creating network "docker_default" with the default driver

exit
