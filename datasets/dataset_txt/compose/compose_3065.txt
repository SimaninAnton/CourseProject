Some applications require that other applications are already booted and readily available in order to launch correctly. For example was only able to launch if the postgres container was already fully available.
My suggestion is to have some method to add a delay between containers launching if need be. I have no clear suggestion as to how you would accomplish this but it would be really helpful.
