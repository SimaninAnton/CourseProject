Description of the issue
I have a docker-compose.yml in the root of my project. There is also a frontend.env and backend.env which is referenced by two different containers in the env_file parameter in docker-compose. Besides that, there is also a .env file in the root of the project to set some args inside the docker-compose
      args:
        - NODE_ENV=development
        - NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN=$NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN
The NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN is defined in the .env file. When running docker-compose config from the root directory I can see that it sets NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN and all variables for backend.env and frontend.env correctly. But when running docker-compose config from the subfolder /frontend I can only see the frontend.env and backend.env variables set correctly, but the NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN is now an empty string.
I did not even knew that it is possible to run docker-compose from a sub directory but it appears so. My problem with all this is that I accidentally run it from the sub directory and since the backend.env and frontend.env variables was populated correctly I was confused about why my .env-file did not work anymore.

Steps to reproduce the issue
create a docker-compose.yml and an .env-file.
Use a variable from the .env-file in docker-compose.yml
cd into a sub directory and run docker-compose config
Observed result
.env is not used when running docker-compose from sub directory.
Expected result
I think that either none of .env, backend.env and frontend.env should work, or all of them should work.
Stacktrace / full error message
none
