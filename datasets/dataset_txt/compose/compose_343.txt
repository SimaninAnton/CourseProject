Background: I am using golang with Buffalo framework to build Http service.
Try to run this in Travis-CI with 7GB while only 5GB of Memory was used. (Which 1GB allocated for the system and 4 GB for Docker in my investigation).
I was trying to 1) Pump up the Docker memory from 4GB to 5GB if that help, I searched for a while. I can't figure out a way to bump it up. Maybe anyone can help on here.
I am using docker-composer.yml version 3. Try with deploy flag on my service, and it won't work as expected since it was not run with swarm?
Try to understand why it would exit as 137 error code. Which currently, I have put --verbose, but it does not have enough information for me to understand why.
Anyone who can help, I will be greatly appreciated.
