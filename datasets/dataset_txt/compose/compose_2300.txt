Documentation stands that docker-compose should substitute shell variables. For now it doesn't seems to be the case for containerised docker-compose, as env is not passed to docker-compose container.
Appending "--env-file <(env)" to containerised compose entry point makes the job, anyway, not sure if it should be sanitized or not - eg. "--env-file <(env | grep -i _proxy)"
