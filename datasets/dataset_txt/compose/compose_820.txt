In some dev environments, you can have some tools needed on a stag server for profiling, APM testing etc. This can be implemented either in the docker image or as separate containers.
Multiple docker-compose files are not fun to work with. So I wonder if it should be possible to start a service in the docker-compose file based on a variable.
Example
In the docker compose on the service we could add a parameter
conditional_startup: true
When this condition is set in the docker-compose it will automatically map to a variable in the .env file.
Then in the .env file we could add this
service_blackfire=true (this will start the service)
service_blackfire=false (this will NOT start the service)
With this, you would not need to maintain complicated CLI commands with -f for another docker-compose file and so on.
