I've started to feel that doing a build during docker-compose up is potentially causing more trouble than it's worth, and I'm curious if anyone is actually using this functionality.
I believe this is a positive change for two reasons:
Anytime I've used docker-compose up I've always had to explicitly docker-compose build first (and often docker-compose pull before that). This is because without doing an explicit build/pull, you risk running an older version of the image.
Doing a build/pull as part of up starts to require that up support every parameter that build and pull require, which leads to more code complexity, and a less clean interface (see #687, #573, #586, which are probably just the start)
Does anyone actually "need" docker-compose up to build containers first? How do you ensure you're actually running the latest container if you don't do an explicit docker-compose build first?
This would be a non-backwards compatible change, so it would require waiting for a new major release.
