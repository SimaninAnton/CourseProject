Hi,
Currently trying to specify max-file & max-size options for default log_driver "json-file", but just can't make it work.
Tried this for example, as suggested in the compose syntax for syslog driver:
log_driver: "json-file"
log_opt:
max-size:"30m"
max-file:"10"
but throws error when starting container
Looked in the associated schema, but ends with type "object" for log_opt which leads me nowhere.
Also looked in unit tests, but only the test for syslog is implemented.
Thanks
