Hello,
With the recent Docker Compose release (1.6 I think), dependencies between services are defined with the depends_on configuration option. This is great !
However, in 1.5, you could docker-compose run <service> and all dependencies (links) would be started. This seems like it is no longer the case. Now I have to to docker-compose up and then docker-compose run <service> so that all dependencies are started properly for <service>.
The use case is to have one service that starts a shell with access to all other running services, without putting an SSH server into each separate service. Then I run docker-compose run shell and I instantly have a shell with access to all services.
Is there a specific reason for this? Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks for taking the time to read this.
Best regards, Conrad
