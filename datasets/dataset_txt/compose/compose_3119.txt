Consider:
leader:
  container_name: rethinkleader
  image: rethinkdb
  labels:
    - com.nathanleclaire.rethinkcluster
  environment:
    - affinity:label!=com.nathanleclaire.rethinkcluster
  expose:
    - "8080:8080"
  restart: always
follower:
  image: rethinkdb
  labels:
    - com.nathanleclaire.rethinkcluster
  command: rethinkdb --bind all --join rethinkleader:28015
  environment:
    - affinity:label!=com.nathanleclaire.rethinkcluster
  restart: always
Running this doesn't forward 8080 to 8080 on the leader instance for me. Let me know if you're unable to dupe.
IIRC, Swarm will schedule -p 8080:8080 just fine (won't schedule on nodes where that port is already in use), so it might be worth just throwing the API request over the fence anyway.
