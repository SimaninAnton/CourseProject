I want to define a named volume in my compose-config, but I need to specify the constraint:node for this named volume.
volumes:
data-app:
image: busybox:latest
volumes:
- /data:/var/www
environment:
- "constraint:node==node1"
But this does not work. Why? How can I specify the destination node for a named volume?
