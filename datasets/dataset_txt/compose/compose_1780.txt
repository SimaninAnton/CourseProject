I'm trying to figure out the hierarchy of how docker compose does environment variables
If I have a compose file that uses a env_file, does that override anything defined in the docker-compose?
What about environment variables defined in the compose file that inherit from the host (without the equal sign)? And what about environment variables defined in another extended file? I couldn't find documentation related to the ordering.
A more clear example:
env_file: .env
environment:
  - MYVAR=123
  - MYVAR2
.env:
MYVAR=321
MYVAR2=hello
The docs say that the shell values take precedent, but let's assume MYVAR2 is NOT defined on the host, will that get overridden by values in the .env?
