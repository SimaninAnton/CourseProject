This is similar to #3267, but for exec.
When you exec something, both STDOUT and STDERR are on STDOUT.
I created an example repository to reproduce this.
My use case is quite simple:
I have a Mysql instance and want to run a database dump, piping its output to the host, e.g.
docker-compose exec mysql mysqldump -ufoo -pbar baz > /var/backups/foo.sql
Having its warning messages (from STDERR) inside the dump file is a problem.
PS: Fun fact: On Postgres, I did not stumble upon this problem, because pg_dump rocks! ;)
