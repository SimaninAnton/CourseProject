From https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes:
Note: The top-level volumes option defines a named volume and references it from each serviceâ€™s volumes list. This replaces volumes_from in earlier versions of the Compose file format.
This is not true, named volumes are not a replacement of volumes_from in v2. Maybe some subset of use cases but it's there are scenarios which v3 does not support and it would be good to be upfront about it in the docs.
