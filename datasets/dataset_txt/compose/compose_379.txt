Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It will be really good to enable a docker plugin via docker-compose.yml file and if the plugin does not exist on the host then first pull, install and then enable. It should do the work of docker plugin install and docker plugin enable
Describe the solution you'd like
version: "3.5"

services:

  php:
    build: ./docker/drupal-tools
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - drupal:/var/www/drupal

plugins:
    local-persist
    
volumes:
    drupal
      driver: local-persist
Describe alternatives you've considered
I always had to enable a plugin manually executing a command docker plugin enable before docker-compose up
