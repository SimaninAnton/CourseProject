I'm opening this issue for @hindsight20-20, who first opened it in Docker for Windows issues.
Please see docker/for-win#527 for the full conversation thread.
Expected behavior
In compose file:
version: "3"
services:
  image: myimage
  myservice:
    healtcheck:
      test: exit 0

  image: myotherimage
  myotherservice:
    depends_on:
      myservice:
        condition: service_healthy
docker-compose up should start services in order and start second only if first is healthy. (see compose file reference and Dockerfile reference)
Actual behavior
when running docker-compose up compose complains that depends_on contains an invalid value. the contents of depends_on should be an array
compose is happily processing the file given above when setting the version to 2.1
