The result of docker-compose help is not helpful:
> docker-compose help
Get help on a command.

Usage: help COMMAND
docker-compose should follow the example of both docker and docker-machine, which print help/usage text when invoked alone or with the "help" subcommand:
> docker 
Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]
       docker daemon [ --help | ... ]
       docker [ --help | -v | --version ]

A self-sufficient runtime for containers.

> docker help
Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]
       docker daemon [ --help | ... ]
       docker [ --help | -v | --version ]
