I do have several compose files. My goal is to combine them using "docker-compose config". The problem is, that docker-compose does not understand its own created file after that.
Given a compose file with a service using a volume_frmo
version: '2'
services:
  first:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes_from:
      - second
  second:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
      - /data
When running 'docker-compose config'
Then the output will be
networks: {}
services:
  first:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes_from:
    - service:second:rw
  second:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
    - /data:rw
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
But "service:second:rw" is an invalid volume spec
ERROR: for second  b'Invalid volume spec "rw": volumeabs: Invalid volume destination path: \'rw\' mount path must be absolute.'
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
