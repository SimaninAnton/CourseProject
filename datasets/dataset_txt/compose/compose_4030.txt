Would it be possible to create a shortcut for fig rm --force? That would be cool to type four letters less :)
Currently, the output looks as follows:
$ fig rm -f
Remove stopped service containers.

Usage: rm [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --force   Don't ask to confirm removal
    -v        Remove volumes associated with containers
Thanks,
Pawel
