Hi,
I'm trying to use the "docker/compose:1.19.0-rc3" docker image to run "docker-compose build":
$ docker run -it --net=host -v $(pwd):/tmp/server -w /tmp/server docker/compose:1.19.0-rc3 build myapp
Building myapp
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon. You might need to install Docker:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
I can run it locally, and the dockerd is definitely running. Any ideas? I'm not really sure how to use this docker image successfully, there aren't any guides that I've seen...
