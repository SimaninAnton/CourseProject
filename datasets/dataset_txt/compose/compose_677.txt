Docker Compose File:
version: '3'

x-shared-env:
  &shared-env
  MYSQL_HOST: db
  MYSQL_NAME: app
  MYSQL_USER: admin
  MYSQL_PASS: 123456

services:
  db:
    image: tutum/mysql:5.6
    environment:
      << : *shared-env
      ON_CREATE_DB: $MYSQL_NAME
When I run it with docker-compose -f 6.2.0.yml up --build --force-recreate, I get:
WARNING: The MYSQL_NAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
ERROR: The Compose file '.\6.2.0.yml' is invalid because:
Invalid top-level property "x-shared-env". Valid top-level sections for this Compose file are: version, services, networks, volumes, and extensions starting with "x-".

You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
The error is not what I expected... versions seem fine and especially, the error message is misleading (Invalid top-level property "x-shared-env" ..... and extensions starting with "x-").
Specs:

I've already seen #5542
