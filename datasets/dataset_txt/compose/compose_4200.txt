With the following Dockerfile:
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN mkdir -p /tmp
RUN mkdir -p /tmp/subdir
RUN touch /tmp/container
And a fig.yml:
test:
build: .
volumes:
- /tmp/subdir:/tmp/subdir
command: ls -l /tmp
I see the contents of the container's tmp dir, as expected after running fig build and fig up
If I then change the volume to point to /tmp like so in fig.yml
test:
build: .
volumes:
- /tmp:/tmp/
command: ls -l /tmp
I will see the contents of the local(host?) /tmp dir, as expected after running fig build and fig up
If I then change back to the original fig.yml file and run fig build and fig up I still see the contents of the local(host) /tmp directory, which is not expected. I should see the container files.
If I run fig run test ls -l /tmp I see the contents of the container directory, which is what I want, but strange because fig up gives different results for the same command.
I can fix this by running fig rm at this point, afterwhich both fig up and fig run test ls -l /tmp will give the same results, as expected.
I am running:
