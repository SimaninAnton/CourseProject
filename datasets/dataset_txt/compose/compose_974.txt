I need to set a system-wide env varible using compose file. I have a stack file that looks like the following:
---
version: "3.3"
  services:
     serv-1:
          environment:
                my_var: "defined"
          ports:
              - "12000:22"
when I ssh into the serv-1 container and run:
 echo $my_var
>> defined
sudo -iu other_user
echo $my_var
>>   
I get nothing when I try to access same env variable using another user. is there a way to set this env variable as global to all users of the system or at least for specific users?
my docker version is:
Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build cec0b72
