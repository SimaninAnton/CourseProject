While create service using docker-compose. the real container name will be a bit longer.
So can we add a command to get container name for a service?
for example : the real name of redis service will be ahugelongproject_redis_1
while we exec
docker-compose svc redis
it will display the real redis service name
ahugelongproject_redis_1
We have to find out the container name by ourself, it is hard and a ugly way
docker-compose ps | grep redis | awk '{ print $1 }'
