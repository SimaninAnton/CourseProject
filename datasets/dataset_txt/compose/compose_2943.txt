Trying very basic example of string interpolation using compose 1.5.2 / docker 1.9.1 on Centos 7.2 and not having any luck.
I've tried $FOO/${FOO}/"$FOO"/"${FOO}" and none work. I've tried setting the variable, exporting it, putting it in my bashrc file and relogging in and compose will see that I'm trying to interpolate a file, but doesn't see a value for it.
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.5.2, build 7240ff3
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$ cat docker-compose.yml
test:
    image: busybox
    container_name: env-test
    environment:
        - BAR=$FOO
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$ export FOO=baz
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$ echo $FOO
baz
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$
[fldengr@localhost tmp]$ docker-compose up
WARNING: The FOO variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
