Hello All,
I got the same error and I have tried many solution but I can not get out of this, Can you please help me?
I got this error :-
In file './docker-compose.yml' service 'version' doesn't have any configuration options. All top level keys in your docker-compose.yml must map to a dictionary of configuration options.
docker-compose.yml file :-
version: '2'
services:
    frontend-server:
    image: node:4
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app:rw
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    privileged: true
    command: "/app/run.sh"
