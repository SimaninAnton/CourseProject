If several services in a composition contain the same build arg, it's very hard (I haven't found a good method yet) to disambiguate it while retaining the ability to have default build args in a Dockerfile.
The obvious way to disambiguate build args would be to prepend the service name:
a:
  build:
    args:
      - x=$a_x
b:
  build:
    args:
      - x=$b_x
However, if $a_x or $b_x are unset, they will be defaulted to empty strings with the warning:
WARNING: The a_x variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Now, they will be passed to docker build as empty strings, circumventing any default arg in the Dockerfile.
This seems to me to be a very surprising and not docker-like way of handling it. A less surprising (and more featureful) method would be to not pass unset build args at all.
