I'm using docker and docker-compose from homebrew (with boot2docker/docker-machine):
$ docker -v
Docker version 1.8.1, build d12ea79
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version: 1.4.0
The docker daemon version is:
$ boot2docker ssh docker -v 
Docker version 1.8.0, build 0d03096
I'm specifying my log_driver in the docker-compose.yml file as per https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/#log-driver, and setting it to none:
docker-compose.yml:
helloworld:
  image: busybox
  command: echo "Hello World!"
  log_driver: none
I'm getting the following error when I 'docker-compose up`:
~/dockercompose-test ❯❯❯ docker-compose up
Starting dockercomposetest_helloworld_1...
Attaching to dockercomposetest_helloworld_1
helloworld_1 | taching: Failed to get logging factory: logger: no log driver named 'none' is registered
dockercomposetest_helloworld_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
The weird thing is this worked in lower versions of docker-compose and docker.
