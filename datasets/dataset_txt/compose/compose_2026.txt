$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
docker-py version: 1.10.3
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
Here's how my docker-compose.yml file looks like:
parse-server:
  image: 94fc5293168d
  restart: always
  env_file: config.env
  ports:
    - "1337:1337"
  environment:
    PORT: 1337
    DATABASE_URI: $DATABASE_URI
    APP_ID: $APP_ID
    MASTER_KEY: $MASTER_KEY
 ......
However, when I run docker-compose up -d, Compose doesn't expose variables from config.env to environment variables.
Curious, when I remove env_file: config.env and rename config.env to .env, everything works just fine.
PS: env_file: ./config.env doesn't work either.
