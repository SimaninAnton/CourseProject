I have a docker image I'm trying to build, that needs to talk to an existing docker network during the build phase. Is it possible to configure the docker-compose build attribute to do this?
I tried something like
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - network=host
but that doesn't work, unsurprisingly.
To be specific, I'm asking if a docker-compose.yml file can be configured to do the same thing as docker build --network=host, or more preferably, docker build --network=external_docker_network
docker: v17.06.0-ce-mac18
docker-compose version 1.14.0, build c7bdf9e
