I tried to reference a environmental variable with a space in it. I also tried with parens "()"
Here is the repro steps in windows.
C:\tmp>set some arg=hello
C:\tmp>docker-compose up
ERROR: Invalid interpolation format for "command" option in service "space": "${some arg}"
C:\tmp>type docker-compose.yaml
version: '2.1'
services:
  space:
    image: microsoft/nanoserver
    command: ["c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe", "/c", "echo", "${some arg}"]
