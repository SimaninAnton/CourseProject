Is there any way to suppress the service-specific output prefix that docker-compose likes to insert?
When piping, I'd prefer:
Just the facts, ma'am.
instead of:
foosvc_1 | Just the facts, ma'am.
If there isn't a relevant switch or yml file option, I guess I can just use sed or else fall back on docker run.
