Hello,
docker-compose version 1.5.2
i'm unable to build images, if there's 'env_file' pointing to nonexistent file. Since building has nothing to do with container's environment, maybe it should be possible?
I think it's related to #1585 and possibly other properties, that are used solely for containers, not building/images.
I also remember(but couldn't find it), there was a discussion whether the build tool should be separated from container management commands. Maybe this issue should be stated as an argument there too.
