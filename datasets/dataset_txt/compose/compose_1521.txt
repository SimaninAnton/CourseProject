Docker-compose has a peculiar syntax check feature that states: no duplicate arguments in the entrypoint configuration key. There are many situations when there are duplicate args in a command string. Here is an example output which drives me crazy:
root@cs81649:~/bottledwater-pg# docker-compose up -d kafka schema-registry postgres
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
Service 'psql' configuration key 'entrypoint' contains non unique items, please remove duplicates from ['psql', '-h', 'postgres', '-U', 'postgres']
Is it possible to change the syntax check behavior?
