Hello,
I have a data.yml that declares various data containers that should not be deleted in normal circumstances.
In the main docker-compose.yml these containers are referenced by name in volumes_from.
With this setup under 1.2 docker-compose rm deletes only containers from docker-compose.yml.
Since 1.3 it tries to delete also the data containers, and this breaks my deploy.
I think that the yml file should be used to restrict the containers found by the label lookup, unless some specific command line option is given.
As a workaround, is there another way to prevent deletion of data containers?
