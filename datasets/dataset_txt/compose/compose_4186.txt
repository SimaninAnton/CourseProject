Using docker build I can pull and build an image directly from Github, for example:
docker build -t java https://github.com/StrictlyBusiness/docker-java8.git
When I try to do the same using fig build and the following fig.yml:
webapp:
  build: https://github.com/StrictlyBusiness/docker-java8.git
it shows Building webapp... then after ~40 seconds, it shows just a single closing bracket ). For example:
$ fig build
Building webapp...
)
I haven't found a way to get any more details on what's happening behind the scenes in fig to know why it's failing.
