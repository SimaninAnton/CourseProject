From the documentation:
Compose preserves all volumes used by your services. When docker-compose up runs, if it finds any containers from previous runs, it copies the volumes from the old container to the new container. This process ensures that any data you’ve created in volumes isn’t lost.
It states that volumes are preserved. However, what's not clear is that volumes are created and preserved even for containers that don't mount one.
I've uploaded an example docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles into wting/maybe_docker_compose_bug. Running it multiple times you'll notice that both containers continue appending timestamps demonstrating persistent state, despite only the web container containing a volume.
