I see the "breaking change" about up resetting a service back down to its "default" value (the last scale'd value?) https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.13.0.
But it seems even doing a docker-compose run other-service /script.sh causes other services to be re-scaled. What's weird is my other services are being scaled back down to 1, so I'm losing volumes! I use depends_on, maybe that's contributing factor.
Sorry I haven't made a simple repro but hoping someone knows more this seems like a serious regression.
