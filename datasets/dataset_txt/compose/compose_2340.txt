docker and docker-compose handle arguments differently.
docker-compose $(docker-machine config default) upcauses an error. (see below)
and
docker-compose $(docker-machine config default | xargs) up works.
joe@jsd-mbp ~ $ docker-compose $(docker-machine config default) -f docker-compose.yml up [2.2.3]
