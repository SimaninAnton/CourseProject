Description of the issue
During docker upgrade with live-restore enabled (over daemon.json file), containers started with docker-compose are stopping. Not sure if that is supposed to be like that and it is docker-compose limitations?
When I start containers with docker run command on the same host with the same version of docker, upgrade doesn't impact running containers.
Context information (for bug reports)
We start docker containers with docker compose yml file.
Output of "docker-compose version"
# docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
docker-py version: 1.10.3
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
# 

but i tried on later versions (up to 1.12) too with the same result.
