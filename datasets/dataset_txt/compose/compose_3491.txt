I want to deploy different services using the same image but with a different configuration file.
Currently to achieve that I can
build as many images that inherit from a common image plus a different COPY in each
mount a single file volume
The first solution isn't feasible and the second it's overkill. I just want to copy a file, not keep it in sync
Proposed configuration:
myservice:
    image: foo/bar
    copy:
        - src:dest
