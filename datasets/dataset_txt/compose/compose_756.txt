When I'm running docker-compose build it's not able to pull private base images.
WHAT I EXPERIENCE
I use docker-credential-gcr and my ~/.docker/config.json is correctly set up.
I'm able to do docker pull myprivaterepo/myimage
I'm able to do docker-compose pull if the image is used as a service image
I'm not able to do docker-compose build as the private base image cannot be pulled.
ERROR: Service 'hello' failed to build: unauthorized: You don't have the needed permissions to perform this operation, and you may have invalid credentials. To authenticate your request, follow the steps in: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication
WHAT I EXPECT
Since I'm able to pull the image with docker pull, Compose should be able to pull too even in a build phase.
REPRO CASE
Dockerfile
From myprivaterepo/myimage
docker-compose.yml
