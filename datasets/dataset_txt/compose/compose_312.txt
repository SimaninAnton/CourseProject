Description of the issue
Hello! We are using compose to roll out our updates.
We found that when running compose, some lines are output to stderr and some to stdout, but it is hard to tell why something is an error or not. This inadvertently broke our roll-out process, because we try/catch the execution of compose.
I used this script here to check what is stdout and stderr: https://superuser.com/questions/453598/determine-if-output-is-stdout-or-stderr
Steps to reproduce:
> $ { { BRANCH_NAME=master docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-onBox.yml up -d; } 2>&3 | sed 's/^/STDOUT: /'; } 3>&1 1>&2 | sed 's/^/STDERR: /'
STDERR: The VERSION variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
STDERR: sicon_mqtt is up-to-date
STDERR: sicon_db is up-to-date
STDERR: sicon_backend is up-to-date
STDERR: sicon_services is up-to-date
stopped sicon_mqtt to test
> $ { { BRANCH_NAME=master docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-onBox.yml up -d; } 2>&3 | sed 's/^/STDOUT: /'; } 3>&1 1>&2 | sed 's/^/STDERR: /'
STDERR: The VERSION variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
STDERR: Starting sicon_mqtt ...
Starting sicon_mqtt ... done
sicon_backend is up-to-date
STDERR: sicon_services is up-to-date
Maybe here is the problem, I have no idea about python, but this looks like this ALWAYS raises an exception and thus report to stderr?
compose/compose/service.py
Lines 570 to 574 in 8f5f7e7
         log.info("%s is up-to-date" % c.name) 
        return containers 
    raise Exception("Invalid action: {}".format(action))

Validate and view the Compose file.

Usage: config [options]

Options:
    --resolve-image-digests  Pin image tags to digests.
    -q, --quiet              Only validate the configuration, don't print
                             anything.
    --services               Print the service names, one per line.
    --volumes                Print the volume names, one per line.
It says nothing else? :S
Observed result
regular status logs get written to STDERR
Expected result
Unless the container can't start or the compose file is malformed, there should be no stderr for succesful container status updates.
