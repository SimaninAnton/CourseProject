Description of the issue
I need to run docker-compose from inside a Windows container and make it connect to the docker daemon on the host which runs this container via a named pipe mount (like docker run -v //./pipe/docker_engine://./pipe/docker_engine ...).
But the problem is that docker-compose uses the WinAPI call WaitNamedPipe in the module npipesocket.py, which seems is not supposed to work from inside a container and throws the error:
pywintypes.error: (2, 'WaitNamedPipe', 'The system cannot find the file specified.')
I have carefully checked that the named pipe is mounted correctly and available via the expected name. And I am able to work with the docker daemon on the same mounted named pipe using the docker-cli from inside the container, which indicates the issue is specific to docker-compose.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Install docker-ee (17.10.0-ee-preview-3) on a Windows Server (version 1709) host
Build an image using the following Dockerfile:
FROM microsoft/windowsservercore:1709

SHELL ["powershell", "-Command"]

RUN [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; \
    Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe" \
    -UseBasicParsing -OutFile 'C:\Program Files\docker-compose.exe'

ENTRYPOINT ["C:/Program Files/docker-compose.exe"]
Copy any docker-compose.yaml into an arbitrary folder on the host (for example C:\temp)
Run the built image with the following command:
docker run --rm -v C:/temp:C:/temp -v //./pipe/docker_engine://./pipe/docker_engine built/imagename --verbose -f C:\temp\docker-compose.yaml up
Observed result
docker-compose throws the error on any command (except for docker-compose version):
pywintypes.error: (2, 'WaitNamedPipe', 'The system cannot find the file specified.')
Expected result
docker-compose is able to work with the docker daemon on the host via a named pipe mounted as a volume
