Description of the issue
When using docker-compose (which was installed as a container) paths specified for the Docker volumes in docker-compose.yml are not expanded properly when using Tilde character.
Instead of taking the home directory of the current user which is executing the docker-compose command the path is expanded for the user root.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01
Output of docker version
Docker version 18.09.1, build 4c52b90
Output of docker-compose config
(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
services:
  web-server:
    image: xxx
    volumes:
    - /root/Code/myApp:/var/www/html:rw
version: '3.0'
Output when running docker-compose installed using standard linux install
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
services:
  web-server:
    image: xxx
    volumes:
    - /home/myUsername/Code/myApp:/var/www/html:rw
version: '3.0'
Steps to reproduce the issue
Install docker-compose using container (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-as-a-container)
Create docker-compose.yml which holds simple service which has a volume mounted with tilde in it's path
Start the composition
Observed result
Tilde is expanded to point a path to home directory of the root user.
Expected result
Tilde should be expanded to point to a path to home directory of the current user running docker-compose.
Additional information
OS Kubuntu 18.04, docker-compose installed as container
