This appears related to 1cf4cf4 in the 1.15 release.
1cf4cf4#diff-7e15cdf56bafabd2844de219394ea620R578
In v1.14, the following compose file worked fine:
base:
  image: some_base_service:latest
  environment:
    ENV_VAR1: some-variable-1
    ENV_VAR2: some-variable-2

worker:
  extends: shared
  image: someworkerimage:latest
this now errors with:
Cannot extend service 'base' in ##docker-compose.yml: Service not found #
