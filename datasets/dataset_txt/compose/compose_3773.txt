Having a docker-compose.yml with restart: always is good for services started by docker up. However when executing commands during a build or during development via docker run --rm ... it'll also restart that container and this command will loop forever.
Could allow specifying --restart never for docker run but that's edge.
Should ignore restart: during docker-compose run ... commands, only use it for docker-compose start or docker-compose up
Could restart linked containers even if they don't have restart: always. This would also fix the issue as one could do:
service:
  links:
    - web
  restart: always
web:
  image: nginx
  links: php
php:
  image: php
Then a docker-compose run --rm php ... would not restart this command, but a docker-compose up service would start and restart all linked services.
