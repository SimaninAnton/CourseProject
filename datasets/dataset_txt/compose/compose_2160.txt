Output of docker version:
Client:
 Version:      1.12.0
 API version:  1.24
 Go version:   go1.6.3
 Git commit:   8eab29e
 Built:        Thu Jul 28 21:15:28 2016
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      1.12.0
 API version:  1.24
 Go version:   go1.6.3
 Git commit:   8eab29e
 Built:        
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):
Using physical box (CentOS 7 host) via docker-machine or docker for mac, results are the same.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Using docker-compose specify a named service (the base image does not seem to matter)
run either of the following:
docker-compose run [service] cat < somefile.txt
# or :
echo 'hello there' |docker-compose run [service] cat
Describe the results you received:
Client hangs and does not exit after contents of redirected input are consumed:
± docker-compose run web cat < docker/postgres/grafana.sql
CREATE ROLE grafana LOGIN PASSWORD 'grafana';
CREATE DATABASE grafana;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE grafana TO grafana;
^C^C^CERROR: Aborting.

± echo 'hello there' |docker-compose run web cat
hello there
^C^CERROR: Aborting.
Describe the results you expected:
Client should exit after redirected stdin hits EOF. The same behavior with docker run exits cleanly as expected:
± echo 'hello there' |docker run --rm -i alpine:latest cat
hello there

± docker run --rm -i alpine:latest cat < docker/postgres/grafana.sql
CREATE ROLE grafana LOGIN PASSWORD 'grafana';
CREATE DATABASE grafana;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE grafana TO grafana;

± 
Describe any additional info:
I've noticed similar behavior when doing docker-compose run [servicename] /bin/sh - when I attempt to exit the shell (with exit or ^D) the client doesn't exit until I hit ^C:
± docker-compose run web /bin/sh
~ $ 
~ $ exit
^C^C^CERROR: Aborting.
