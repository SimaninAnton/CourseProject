Not sure if this is #637 or not.
My fig.yml has a basic volumes: directive:
    volumes:
    - localfolder:/var/www/html
When I run fig up, the containers get created and I can see the volumes are linked correctly with docker inspect.
Then, if I run fig stop, fig up, it continues to work.
However if I run fig stop, service docker restart, then fig up, the Volumes are lost.
docker inspect looks like:
"Volumes": {
        "/var/www/html": "/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/638d9c6bbeb312d7a6c40358524cb67f117c665f025e18743f49989f964e5ae6"
    },
instead of "/var/www/html": "/path/to/localfolder"
