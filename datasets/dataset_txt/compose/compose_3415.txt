Docker has introduced a new top-level concept of a "network", accompanied by new CLI and API functionality. Compose should support this â€“ both out of the box, and allowing the user to manually configure complex topologies.
Experimental support for networks - #2191
Specify networks in the Compose file - #2478
Move network support out of experimental status and make it the default (or only) means of inter-service communication
Use service name and short name alises #2312
Support setting the default network name #2470
