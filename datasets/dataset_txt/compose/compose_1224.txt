Hi all,
How do I resolve host address for an api container url that another web container has a dependency on in compose 3 ?
For example, my compose file is:
version: '3'

services:
  web2:
    image: softwaremaker/web-w
    environment:
      - wtmsdemo_customerapi01=http://api/api/values
    ports:
      - "89:80"
    depends_on:
      - api
  api:
    image: softwaremaker/api-w

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: nat
I used to think that the api image (softwaremaker/api-w) will be able to resolve into the environment variables I had set up above but it doesnt work.
Also, how would this be different in both Linux and Windows ? I understand Windows docker still has the same internal NAT issues so I used the networks section above.
Thanks for looking and helping.
