Hello,
I went through the documentation and I could not find how I can uninstall docker-compose.
I installed docker and docker-compose to know more about it. Now I am done and I wish to remove them. However, I could not find any info about how to carry that out.
I installed them through the instructions in the website.
OS: Ubuntu 14.04
