        container_name: tomcat7-jar8
        image: tomcat:8.5
        ports:
            - 8080
        volumes:
            - ./tomcat/webapps:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps
            - ./tomcat/logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs
Adding the first line causes the file in the container to be removed.
Log file synchronization is normal.
Commented out webapps tomcat is normal.
This question is very strange, I do not know how to solve.
Or other ways to solve.
