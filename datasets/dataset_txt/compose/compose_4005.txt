You should be able to define a simple application with Fig and run it on Swarm with fig up -d.
This work was started in #763. One remaining issue is that Swarm returns names with more slashes in it than the normal Docker daemon, so Fig needs to parse this correctly.
Assumptions:
links won't work
volumes probably won't work
