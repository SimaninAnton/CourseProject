Expected behavior
When I run e.g. docker-compose up hello (see docker-compose.yml below) and the Docker daemon is not running, I expect an error message to that effect (much like docker ps gives me).
Actual behavior
Instead, I get a Python stack trace, ultimately complaining that "The system cannot find the file specified."
