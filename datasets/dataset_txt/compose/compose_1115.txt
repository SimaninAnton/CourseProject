Currently docker-compose pull does not support specifying a docker-compose file. We often have multiple yml files for different purposes so none are "docker-compose.yml" or not necessarily the one that has all the images we want to pull. It would be nice to have an option such as:
docker-compose pull --file docker-compose-with-suffix.yml
