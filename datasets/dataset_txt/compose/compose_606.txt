Description of the issue
We previously were storing credentials for registries in the ~/.dockercfg file. After updating to the latest version of compose however this has stopped working. Pulls from private repos fail due to authorization.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a docker-compose.yml which contains a reference to an image hosted in a private repo.
Put valid credentials to this repo in the ~/.dockercfg file.
Ensure that ~/.docker/config.json does not exist.
Run docker-compose --verbose pull.
Note that while credentials are found in the config, they are not correctly used to pull from private repo.
Run docker login with the same credentials.
Re-run docker-compose --verbose pull command and see success for pulling from the private repo.
Observed result
ERROR: compose.cli.errors.log_api_error: pull access denied for , repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
Expected result
