So I have a docker-compose.yml that looks like this:
mongo:
    image: mongo:2.6
    command: "--smallfiles"
    volumes_from: data
    restart: always
    mem_limit: 100MB

data:
    image: mongo:2.6
    volumes: /data/db
When I run docker-compose up, I get this:
Service "mongo" mounts volumes from "d", which is not the name of a service or container.
Version: 1.1.0-rc2
Queh?
