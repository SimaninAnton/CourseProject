Related to #788 & kind of #1341
There's kind of many tools able to generate diagrams from docker compose yml config files:
url language v2 format support
https://github.com/dockerboard/marsoon js no
https://github.com/digibib/docker-compose-dot go partial
https://github.com/abesto/docker-compose-graphviz go no
http://dockercompose.inventage.com ? no
https://github.com/rabelenda/docker2plant groovy no
https://github.com/Alexis-benoist/draw-compose python no
But, of course, here's the conclusion when testing them:
They don't reuse the official docker-compose config parser.
They're all incomplete, so 6 incomplete products instead of 1 complete one, there's a way to group the development effort.
They don't have guidelines for the rendered output, each of them have some nice ideas but would be cool to put all the ideas together to make something great.
Docker don't support them in any way.
So, docker guys, should be great to help this kind of tool emerging the right way no?
1st, maybe the config parser for docker compose could be available a separate lib? Or docker-compose could provide some plugins interface?
It would be also very pleasant at the end to provide a gorgeous docker color palette by default for the generated diagram that could make them like beautiful, consistent / pro diagrams.
