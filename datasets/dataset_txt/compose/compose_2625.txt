I have a docker volume container that define SPARK_HOME as a environment variable. I want to set this variable automatically in containers that mount this spark volume container. What's the best way to achieve this?
I tried the following but the shell does not expand the variable when the app container is started.
spark:
    image: spark
app:
    image: app
    hostname: airflow-accept
    restart: always
    volumes_from:
        - spark
    environment:
        - SPARK_HOME="$$SPARK_ENV_SPARK_HOME"
    links:
        - spark
Also tried with $SPARK_ENV_SPARK_HOME but this expands the variable on the machine that invoked docker-compose, not the running app container.
Cheers,
