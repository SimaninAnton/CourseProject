I have a container that has data put into a VOLUME. So when I run docker-compose run container cmd and then just docker-compose up I am actually creating two separate volumes which is not the use case I would want. I want to have the data consistent between running it with either method.
From docker inspect I see the different is in naming scheme one is dir_container_1 and the other is dir_container_run_1
considering docker-compose has moved to using labels over names I am sure you can see how things are about to get very very messy.
