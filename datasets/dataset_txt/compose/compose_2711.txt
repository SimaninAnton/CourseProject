To reproduce execute the command:
docker-compose -p demo -f compose.yml up test & docker-compose -p demo -f compose.yml up test2
where the file compose.yml is:
version: "2"
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu:14.04
    command: ping -c 5 test2
  test2:
    image: ubuntu:14.04
    command: ping -c 5 test
You will see that the 2 services are not recognizing each other. The workaround is to create the network upfront, or avoid the concurrent launch first time around.
Now this is a result of an issue I reported for docker where concurrent calls to docker network create with the same name creates multiple network instance.
The use case I saw with compose was that each call to start a service was in a different upstart script. Both scripts started simultanously and triggered the above scenario. If the network is created upfront - all works well.
