With docker-compose 1.8.0 in my GoCD pipeline, I get the following error message when trying to pull the images for a compose file which contains (a) images which are to be pulled from a private repository and additionally (b) an image from a public repository (postgres:9.4 in my case):

Before doing the docker-compose pull I do a docker login with our registry URL (that's the "Login Succeeded"). With other compose files containing only images from our private registry, it works. But here compose seems to use the private credentials for the public registry (registry-1.docker.io).
Am I doing something wrong, or might this just be a little bug?
