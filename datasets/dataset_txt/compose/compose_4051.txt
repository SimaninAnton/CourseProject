Discussed this with @dnephin in IRC this evening, and he said it would be worth an issue here:
Allow a range of host ports to use when auto-assigning port forwarding to containers. For example, "5000..5100:80" would indicate that the ports 5000 to 5100 should be chosen from when scaling containers.
When scaling, pick the lowest available port in the range.
When no more ports are available in the range, fail to spawn new containers via scale.
When containers are spun down via scale, reclaim their ports for future use.
Why: I would like to set up haproxy in front of X hosts that manage Y containers via fig, and be able to have a predictable range of ports on each host that will forward to containers. This way, I could use haproxy's health check configuration to determine what ports should be routed to on what hosts.
