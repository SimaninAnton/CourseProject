NBD but I was surprised that if you have multiple sections in docker-compose.yml, the earlier ones are ignored. I'd expect them to be merged or at least a warning.
  elasticsearch:
    ...
    # This volumes is completely ignored because it's defined later
    volumes:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro
    ...
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/elasticsearch/data
