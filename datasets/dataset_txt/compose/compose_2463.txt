It could be nice to get some useful value without to have the need to create environment variables as:
the current user id, owner of the compose processus
same for the group id
used docker version
used compose version
running compose platform
I've made a PR #3367 to be able to get them with a special syntax. Vote or comment to let me know if you are interessed or if I'm wasting my time ;)
Thanks
