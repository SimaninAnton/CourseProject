H,
I would like to run docker command from perl script on Apache server (CentOS 7)
I add user that run apache process to a docker group.
When I run docker command, like 'docker images' from a command line everything goes okay.
When I run from a browser, I get:
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.27/images/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
same user used in both cases.
It's look like when it run from browser, apache miss something because it did not do regular login.
Any idea why it happen?
Thanks.
