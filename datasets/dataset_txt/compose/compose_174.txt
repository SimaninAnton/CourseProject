Hi,
I wonder if this is bug or an expected behaviour.
When I use docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d, the named volume doesn't get refreshed completely hence reason some changes to .dockerignore is ignored.
e.g. If I create a new file/folder in app's source folder and add them to .dockerignore it is fine. However, if I add an existing file/folder to .dockerignore, they are still in the named volume.
Is there a way to sync named volumes as well? I guess docker volume rm .. is not ideal in production for no downtime.
Note: I am using named volume in production to keep source code in a container in order to prevent exposing it to host OS.
Thanks
