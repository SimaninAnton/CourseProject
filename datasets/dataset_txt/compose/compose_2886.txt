I want to use devices in a service but I don't want to hardcode them in the docker-compose.yml.
foo:
   devices:
      # hopefully these can be passed as an environment variable, not hardcoded?
      - "/dev/sdc:/dev/sdc"
      - "/dev/sdd:/dev/sdd"
      - "/dev/sde:/dev/sde"
      ...
How do I pass them all as an environment variable? I tried various approaches like below but they didn't work. I guess environment variable substitution only works with strings, not arrays?
foo:
   devices: [ $FOO_DEVICES ]
$ env FOO_DEVICES=/dev/null:/dev/null1,/dev/null:/dev/null2 docker-compose up -d

Any suggestions are appreciated.
