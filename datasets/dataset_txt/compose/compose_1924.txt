I'm using macOS 10.12.1 (16B2555) and trying to follow Command-line completion - Docker:
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/$(docker-compose version --short)/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 10552  100 10552    0     0  96288      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  119k
$ ls -la /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose 
-rw-r--r--  1 alexus  admin  10552 Nov 15 22:13 /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
$ 
yet, completion still unavailable( I also would like to get completion going for docker as well.
Please advise.
