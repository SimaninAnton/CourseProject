Use case: I have a couple of build files and a private registry and docker swarm running locally, i want to build and push to the private registry so swarm can access all the images.
The private registry is 10.0.0.0:4000 the build directory for containers is ./docker/lb/.
I want to build the container and push it to my private registry using docker-compose build --push
When running i want to pull it from that image (i.e private registry).
Instead of having image: and the build: mutuality exclusive in the yaml we could just allow them both and add a push operator to build.
This way the workflow for private registries and running them would be made much easier when using swarm.
What you people think?
