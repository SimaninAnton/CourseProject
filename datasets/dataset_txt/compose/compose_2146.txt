Problem: Running nginx using docker-compose doesn't work, but running with docker run works fine.
Details:
docker-compose.yml in folder nginxcompose:
version: '2'
services:
  mytestserver:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
After running docker-compose up, and accessing http://localhost, Chrome's status bar says "Waiting for localhost" (which is different from not running docker-compose at all).
The nginx log is empty.
Expected behaviour is that I get shown the Nginx startup site.
I can get Nginx to work by simply running
docker run -p 80:80 nginx
