Hello,
I'm not sure if this task is something that compose can handle alone, or if I also need to create a ticket against the docker project, but I figured to start here.
My use case is:
I have ngnix, cassandra, and a web container running, via docker-compose up.
I've updated an env_file used by the web container.
Now, I'd wish to have my web container use the updated env_file.
If I try:
docker-compose [stop|kill] web
docker-compose start web
I still get my original envars that were in place at the time of docker-compose up.
How can I reload my web container to consume the updated env_file without having to do a full shutdown via docker-compose down?
Thanks for any help and guidance!
