The second time you fig up, fig rewrites the entry point on a container. To reproduce this issue, start with the following fig file:
whomovedmyentrypoint:
    image: scratch
    entrypoint: fail
Then, run fig up twice, inspecting the entry point each time:
$ fig up; docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Entrypoint}}' $(docker ps -ql); fig up; docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Entrypoint}}' $(docker ps -ql)

The use case for not changing the entry point is that the minimal container just for housing volumes (documented by Docker as Data Volume Containers) is little more than scratch with directories and a single, no-op executable like true-asm.
