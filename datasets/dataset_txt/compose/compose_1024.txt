I probably have missed something important but I would kindly appreciate you help.
After playing with running "python server.py", I have installed docker-compose, and ran "docker-compose up".
All of the configuration of CTFD I have previously made (challenges for example) are not showing. Starting the "server.py" makes them appear again.
How can I make this work ?
(I have already tried using the export and import features, but with no success. What am I missing ?)
