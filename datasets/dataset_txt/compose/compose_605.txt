Description of the issue
Docker compose doesn't seem to support locally built images, instead, assuming they are docker hub images, and prompting that they are not found there, and might require docker login.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Build an image outside the current working dir (docker build -t testimg1 .)
Reference this image in the image field of a docker-compose file
Instead of pulling it, it attempts and fails to pull from dockerhub.
Observed result
Tries to use dockerhub despite needed image existing locally.
Expected result
Use local image if available before pulling from DH
Stacktrace / full error message
ERROR: pull access denied for testimg1, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
