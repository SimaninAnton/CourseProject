Here is my Compose File
version: '2.1'

services:
  NotificationProcessor:
    image: notificationprocessor 
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on: 
    - SQLServer
    mem_limit: 2G
    environment:
     DataSource: SQLServer
     DBName: IODC_Central
     DBIntegratedSecurity: "false"
     DBUserid: sa
     DBPassword: LoveDocker

  SQLServer:
    image: microsoft/mssql-server-windows-developer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    volumes:
      - "C:/Base_4_0_Database/:C:/Base_4_0_Database/"
    environment:
     sa_password: LoveDocker
     ACCEPT_EULA: Y
     attach_dbs: "[{'dbName':'IODC_Central','dbFiles':['C:\\\\Base_4_0_Database\\\\IODC_Central.mdf','C:\\\\Base_4_0_Database\\\\IODC_Central_log.ldf']}]"
Sadly the notification processor can only connect to database if I run the SQL container first then get its IP replace
DataSource: SQLServer
with
DataSource: 172.26.0.120 (example of a randomly generated ip) inside of the compose file and then compose up the notification processor
It should be able to connect to it using the service name so that I could call docker-compose up and it would connect. Anyone have any guidance?
