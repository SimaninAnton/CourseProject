I use a build tool called bldr.io, it runs and prints output of each job, but for some reason it doesn't print any output from the docker-compose commands. The question is, does docker-compose actually print to stdout? E.g.:
docker-compose run   data "bin/phpunit -c app"
PHPUnit 4.8.9 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

.............................................................

Time: 2.08 seconds, Memory: 24.50Mb

OK (61 tests, 183 assertions)
which works fine, but absolutely no output running the same command within the bldr.io:
 Using the 'test' profile
  - Run tests -



Running the tests job > Run tests

    [exec] - Starting

==============================

  RUN  'docker-compose' 'run' 'data' 'bin/phpunit -c app'

  RES  'docker-compose' 'run' 'data' 'bin/phpunit -c app'

==============================


  Build Success!
The non-compose commands prints output without any problems which makes me think docker-compose is different here.
