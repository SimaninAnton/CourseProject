I am observing behavior that may be by design but is unexpected & not clear from documentation.
Scenario:
base-compose.yml in /run
volumes:
- app_logs/:/app/logs

extends-compose.yml in /run/release-ab
volumes:
- other-volume/:/container/volumes
Results:
/run/app_logs/
/run/release-ab/other-volume/
Since compose up is performed from the context of the extends-compose.yml, I would expect merged relative file paths to start from there i.e.
/run/release-ab/app_logs/
/run/release-ab/other-volume/
Volume extension with relative file paths doesn't work for our use case in this behavior.
Thanks for clarifying
