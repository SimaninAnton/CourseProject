Currently it is not possible to build Docker-Compose for ARM (e.g. Raspberry Pi) with the standard Dockerfile and scripts in scripts/build/linux and scripts/build/linux-entrypoint.
This is mainly due to the fact that pyinstaller does not come with a bootloader that supports ARM out of the box.
How to add ARM support
This repository and PR demonstrates what needs to be done to build Docker-Compose for ARM.
I would like to help and prepare a PR that adds support for building Compose for ARM.
Before I start I would like to get some feedback and some direction on how to go about this.
One way to implement this would be to add some detection for the OS and the architecture similar to how it is done in the docker/docker repo.
Based on the result one could either install standard pyinstaller or the version patched for ARM support. This switch could be implemented in scripts/build/linux-entrypoint.
What do you think?
