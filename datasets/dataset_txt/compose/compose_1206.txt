Currently according to the documentation, you cannot use container_name when you scale using docker-compose -- It will throw an error.
It would be nice if you could add a count property to ensure this name is unique when scaling.
For example:
container_name: 'my-service-$count`
Launching it with my-service=2 would result in a container named my-service-0 and my-service-1
