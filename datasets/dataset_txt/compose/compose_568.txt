Description of the issue
The error "ERROR: network network_main_net id ... has active endpoints" isn't particularly useful and blocks docker-compose down.
Details
I have multiple docker-compose.yml files that look like this:
version: '2.3'
services:
  someservice:
    networks:
    - networks_main_net
    ...

networks:
  network_main_net:
    name: network_main_net
So far, this is the only way to have a shared network over multiple docker-compose.yml groups which doesn't involve some hackery with a special network-owning folder that needs to be uped first.
However, for all of those containers, docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d is broken:
# docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
Stopping mail ... done
Removing mail ... done

ERROR: network network_main_net id 6aaf7ec207e435452261aa3f408813c1197d5a5080288d70e4886373427c9fe7 has active endpoints
Since the error isn't actually useful to me and certainly not something I would want it to abort over (of course there are still active endpoints - that's the point of sharing the network!) I suggest that it is converted into a warning.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Use shared network alike to networks.some_name.name: some_name (used by a container as services.myservice.networks: ["some_name"] as shown above)
Set up 2+ docker-compose.yml groups that all share this same network name
Do docker-compose up -d for all the groups sharing this network
Do docker-compose down on one of them
Observed result
error message that isn't particularly surprising or relevant, and exit code non-zero
Expected result
warning (or no network-related output at all) and exit code 0
