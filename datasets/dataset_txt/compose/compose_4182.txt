I'm trying to use fig to expose my entire test environment.
My fig file looks like this:
test:
  links:
    - postgres
    - redis
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
    - "6379:6379"

postgres:
  image: paintedfox/postgresql
  environment: 
    USER: "accounts" 
    PASS: "accounts_password"
    DB: "accounts"
  expose:
    - "5432"

redis:
  image: redis
  expose:
    - "6379"
I'd like to just run fig up test to build the test app so I can then use both postgres and redis externally. What am I missing here?
