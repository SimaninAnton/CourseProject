I have multiple compose files that rely on a common overlay network within a swarm cluster. I planned to define the common network using a compose file but it doesn't create it unless it is used within the compose file itself.
This is simple to duplicate:
docker-compose.ml
version "2"
networks:
  backbone:
    driver: overlay
docker compose up -d then gives this warning:
WARNING: Some networks were defined but are not used by any service: backbone
and the network isn't shown by docker network ls
On the other hand, using docker network create -d overlay backbone does create the network as expected.
