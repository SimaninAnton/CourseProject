According to the docker-compose run output:
--entrypoint CMD      Override the entrypoint of the image.
But, it doesn't overwrite, it gets appended, or fails because it reads the CMD as a SERVICENAME. To reproduce:
Dockerfile:
FROM busybox

ENTRYPOINT ["echo","hello"]
docker-compose.yml:
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    build:
      context: .
Result:
$ docker-compose run test --entrypoint echo bye
hello --entrypoint echo bye
$ docker-compose run --entrypoint test echo bye
ERROR: No such service: echo
I've tried on a few different images, all with the same result.
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
