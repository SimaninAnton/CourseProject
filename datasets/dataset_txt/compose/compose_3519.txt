I'm getting a strange error no matter what command I run with docker-compse. From what I can tell, this suggest that docker-compose is trying to run under python 2.6 as opposed to the bundled 2.7.
I'm running Centos 6.6 in Digital Ocean. Interestingly docker-compose works on a different Centos 6.6 installation built from a vagrant box, but not on DO. I have replicated this issue with a fresh droplet on digital ocean using the following steps.
Create droplet using the Centos 6.5 x64 image
Run yum install epel-release
Run yum install python-pip
Run pip install docker-compose
Run docker-compose --version
The full error text is below
