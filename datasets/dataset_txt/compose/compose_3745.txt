I'm setting up a deployment stack, and I'm using Ansible to bootstrap a server, namely installing Docker and Docker compose (fig).
I'm wondering why it's not recommended for production us yet? I've seen this in the main documentation but there are no specific reasons as to why.
I could possibly use Ansible instead with the docker module, but docker-compose's API is better for the dev env, and using Ansible for production would not be DRY at all, since it would basically do the same thing compose does.
