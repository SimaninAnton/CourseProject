It seems like nothing much has been done within past year in the direction of making docker-compose a framework with CLI tool instead of just a CLI tool. Related issues were summarized in #230 but it is irrelevant to build RESTful framework within D-compose since there are too many frameworks to do that and there would be too large discussion with no consensus.
Here's plan to make docker-compose a library:
Define contract between compose core components and CLI.
Implement abstraction layer between compose core and CLI.
Refactor compose core code into its own module (compose/core).
Refactor compose CLI code into its own module (compose/cli).
Provide compose core API tests.
Provide compose core API reference documentation.
