docker-compose get confused with the path while aggregating multiple compose files from different directories
Below the directory structure
.
├── mod1 
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── httpd
│       └── Dockerfile
└── mod2
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    └── phpd
        └── Dockerfile
Below are the errors
$ docker-compose -f mod1/docker-compose.yml -f mod2/docker-compose.yml build
ERROR: build path /home/ubuntu/multi-directory-issue/mod1/phpd either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.
$ docker-compose -f mod2/docker-compose.yml -f mod1/docker-compose.yml build
ERROR: build path /home/ubuntu/multi-directory-issue/mod2/httpd either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.
As you could see above, compose is getting confused with the path.. However it is able to build them individually as shown below
$ docker-compose -f mod1/docker-compose.yml build
Building httpd
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu:14.04
##  TEXT - TRUNCATED ## 

$ docker-compose -f mod2/docker-compose.yml build
Building phpd
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu:14.04
##  TEXT - TRUNCATED ## 
Below are the sample Dockerfiles
$ cat mod1/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  httpd:
    build: httpd

$cat mod2/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  phpd:
    build: phpd
