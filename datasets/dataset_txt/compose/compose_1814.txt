Hi There,
I am developing an authorization plugin. My implementation is inspire from Develop a Docker Authorization Plugin in Python.
It works like a charm when networks and containers are created manually with
docker network create proxy_rdesk
docker run -d -e "SOURCEIPPORT=:8000" -e "TARGETIPPORT=xpra-proxy:10000" \
        --network="proxy_rdesk" --hostname="websock" --name="websock" -p 8000:8000 \
        centos/websockify /home/websock/start_websockify.sh
docker run -d --network="proxy_rdesk" --hostname="www" --name="www" -p 80:80 \
        centos/apache /root/bin/start_httpd.sh
Every commands are well validated by my authorization plugin.
But when docker-compose is used with the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2.1'

networks:
  rdesk:
    driver: bridge

services:
  websock:
        image: centos/websockify
        environment:
        - SOURCEIPPORT=:8000
        - TARGETIPPORT=xpra-proxy:10000
        networks:
        - rdesk
        hostname: websock
        container_name: websock
        ports:
        - 8000:8000
        command: /home/websock/start_websockify.sh

  www:
        image: centos/apache
        networks:
        - rdesk
        hostname: www
        container_name: www
        ports:
        - 80:80
        command: /root/bin/start_httpd.sh
It fails at any object creation saying:
plugin authz failed with error: Post http://%2Frun%2Fdocker%2Fplugins%2Fauthz.sock/AuthZPlugin.AuthZRes: http: ContentLength=637 with Body length 0
I tried to increase processes and threads parameters in uwsgi with no chance... But I believe the issue is not coming from there as my uwsgi logs say it received requests and had responded.
Any idea where to investigate ?
thanks and regards,
