Description of the issue
If running in non swarm mode with compose file v3 the following is an example of an error you get when a secret is missing:
ERROR: for app Cannot create container for service app: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist
docker-compose should check for existence of the source path and provide a user friendly error if it doesn't exist.
