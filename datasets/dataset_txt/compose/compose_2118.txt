Setup
I have deployed a swarm standalone cluster on 3 nodes (each behaving as manager and regular node) with Zookeeper as the discovery service (mainly following Build a Swarm cluster for production). Everything seems to be working (docker info shows 3 healthy nodes). I can run containers as well.
So I tried using docker-compose to test the 'scale' functionality. I followed this tutorial: How to scale Docker Containers with Docker-Compose.
Problem
I was surprised to see that all containers were deployed on the same host. Then I tried scaling the containers (by 10) but they remained on the same node.
Is this the expected behavior?
How do I get the load to be shared across nodes?
PS: I just noticed that docker-compose now has some affinity/filter/scheduling but I didn't use any of those.
