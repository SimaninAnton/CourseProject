Hi there,
First, here is my fig.yml:
web:
  image: web:latest
  links:
   - "db"
  ports:
   - "80"
db:
  image: db:latest
I am trying to run the following (hope you can get a simple understanding of my example):
fig scale web=1 db=3
This is how fig starts the containers:
prefix_db_1
prefix_db_2
prefix_db_3
prefix_web_1
However, if I "docker exec -t -i prefix_web_1 /bin/bash" and run "cat /etc/hosts" on the container I can't see any db links.
Where as, if I simply run "fig -d up", I can see the db references in /etc/hosts. But, it only starts up the following:
prefix_db_1
prefix_web_1
...as expected.
Anyone able to help, I think this is a bug?!?
Thanks,
Aaron.
