Previously docker-compose up -d would never change the number of instances deployed.
For example, if I run the following:
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose scale my_service=5
docker-compose up -d
I would still have 5 instances running.
With the latest version, if I run, the same sequence:
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose scale my_service=5
docker-compose up -d
It actually removes 4 of the 5 instances. Why does the scale command have to be tightly coupled to the up command and break legacy behavior?
This is with a legacy swarm cluster Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be
And with Mac OSX 17.09.1-ce-mac42 (21090)
Even if I target a different service, docker compose will rescale even the other services.
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose scale my_service=5
docker-compose up -d my_other_service
my_service will be scaled back down to 1.
This just breaks legacy scripts and behavior on so many levels.
