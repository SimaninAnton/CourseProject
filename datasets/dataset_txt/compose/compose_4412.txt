I was having issues with the cert chain, so I followed what is on this thread for docker-osx: moby/moby#3683 . I'm able to do a docker login just fine using a new binary on mac os x.
However when using fig and having the Dockerfile pull from the same private registry I get the following error using fig build:
Step 1 : FROM ssl-repo.com/image
Pulling repository ssl-repo.com/image
Error: Authentication is required.
Does fig read the .dockercfg? Any other ideas on what the issue could be here?
