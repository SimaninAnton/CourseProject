I have been running a webserver without problems for months with the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:    
        my-container:
                restart: always
                build: ../my-container
                ports:
                        - "80:8080"
For some reasons, I decided to use macvlan for the network setup, as follows:
version: '2'
services:
        my-container:
                restart: always
                build: ../my-container
                ports:
                        - "80:8080"
                networks:
                        mynetwork:
                                ipv4_address: "10.12.1.22"

networks:
        mynetwork:
                driver: macvlan
                ipam:
                        driver: default
                        config:
                                - subnet: "10.12.0.0/16"
                                  gateway: "10.12.0.1"
                                  ip_range: "10.12.1.0/24"
                driver_opts:
                        parent: "eth0"
The network is working fine, but the 80:8080 port mapping is ignored: I can successfully access my webpage on port 8080, but not on port 80. If I remove the networks again, then the port mapping works.
Am I missing something in the docker-compose.yml? Should I define the port mapping differently when using networks?
