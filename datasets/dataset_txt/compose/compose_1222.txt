I am not sure how to solve this issue.. I tried for an hour.
I uninstalled previous versions of Docker and docker-compose, I reinstalled the new docker for macosx.
The dir structure ha both the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile in the same directory, here are the files:
#Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
MAINTAINER Daniel Ram
COPY . /var/www
WORKDIR /var/www

RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
#docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  playthis_server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "1000m"
          max-file: "10"
    ports:
        # - "80:3000"
        - "3003:3003"
    restart: "always"
    networks:
        - app
networks:
  app:
    driver: bridge
After running this command, it fails to build:
$docker-compose up -d

Building playthis_server
ERROR: the Dockerfile (Dockerfile) cannot be empty

Any ideas on how to solve this issue?
