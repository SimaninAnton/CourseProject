Docker compose doesn't seem to respect the "last-line" precedence of .dockerignore files. This is described here in the .dockerignore docs.
For example, even the simple example provided in the doc section above doesn't seem to work when using Docker compose:
 *.md
!README*.md
README-secret.md
The file README-secret.md gets included -- not excluded.
I'm using the following:
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build 94f7016
Docker version 1.11.1, build 5604cbe
Mac OS X 10.11.6
