I read the overview here - https://docs.docker.com/compose/swarm/ :
If you’re using version 2, your app should work with no changes:
...
Once you’ve got [swarm] running, deploying your app to it should be as simple as:
$ eval "$(docker-machine env --swarm <name of swarm master machine>)"
$ docker-compose up
But when running docker-compose against a swarm, it provides a warning (below) and runs all docker-compose instances against the targeted master.
WARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.
Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.
To deploy your application across the swarm, use the bundle feature of the Docker experimental build.
More info:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/bundles
This is a request to update the docs to point folks in the right direction (which I'm guessing is the .dab experiment)
