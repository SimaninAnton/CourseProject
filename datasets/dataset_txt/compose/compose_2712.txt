When using composefile version 2 with the default bridge network this error occurs:
$ docker-compose up
Creating dockercomposetest_debian_1
ERROR: b'Network-scoped alias is supported only for containers in user defined networks'
This is my docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'

services:
  debian:
    image: debian:wheezy

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: bridge
I'm using compose 1.6.0 and docker 1.10.1.
