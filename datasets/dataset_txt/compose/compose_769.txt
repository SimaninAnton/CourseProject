Updating D4W to 18.03.0 broke docker-compose
The Docker for Windows application notified me of an update: 18.03.0-ce-win59 (16762)
After installing this update any docker-compose command errors out with:
Error loading Python DLL 'C:\Users\XYZ\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI238842\python36.dll'. LoadLibrary:
I've since completely removed Docker for Windows and reinstalled 18.03.0-ce-win59 (16762).
The issue persists: docker-compose.exe will not run.
Context information (for bug reports)
Docker Engine Version: 18.03.0-ce-win59 (16762) Stable (670d80d)
Compose 1.20.1
Machine 0.14.0
Credential Helpers: 0.6.0
Notary: 0.6.0
None of the docker-compose commands work. They all exit with a popup and the error:
Error loading Python DLL 'C:\Users\XYZ\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI238842\python36.dll'. LoadLibrary:
Steps to reproduce the issue
Update D4W
Try to run docker-compose
