Similar to #159 but with fig starting the linked container first. You would need some "global id" to indicate that this is a container shared between other fig.ymls.
So I might have:
app1/fig.yml:
couchdb:
    global_id: couchdb_database

app:
    links:
        - couchdb
app2/fig.yml:
couchdb:
    global_id: couchdb_database

app2:
    links:
        - couchdb
If I fig up app1 then couchdb is started. But If I fig up on app2 (after starting app1) then the pre-existing couchdb would be linked to app2.
This basically gets rid of a manual step of launching couchdb that I would have to do it #159
