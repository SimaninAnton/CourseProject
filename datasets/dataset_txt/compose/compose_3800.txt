The documentation is slightly ambiguous about what happens when you specify environment variables using both env_file and environment. It does say "Environment variables specified in environment override these values" but what about when environment doesn't specify the values like so:
  environment:
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD:
   POSTGRES_USER:
  env_file: .env
It'd be nice to have POSTGRES_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_USER in .env and have them in docker-compose.yml at the same time. Basically telling people, "hey, you need to provide these values" either in .env or in the shell environment you run docker-compose up in.
If that's not possible or would only add confusion, then it'd be cool to add that the override happens even when they are blank and read from the shell environment.
