It would be very useful to have a 'list' command to list all containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Ex: docker-compose list
Output:
    apache
    mysql
It could have some options, for example:
-i (show images)
    output: apache (repo/apacheimg:latest)
-d (show dependencies)
-s (show status: up|exit)
