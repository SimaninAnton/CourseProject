Hi,
I've written up the issue on SO.
Summary
The setup works when I'm not using docker compose. In other words I create the network, build the nginx image manually, and run the containers manually. When I try to automate everything with docker compose, it works, but it will not pass through a domain name that I can configured in /etc/hosts. I provided curl examples in the SO post.
I also filed in an issue with Nginx/docker
