Hello,
I was looking to write an yml file for complex application configuration. I wanted to split it to smaller files, so I was looking for include command, so I could use:
include webserver.yml
include db.yml
Proposed extend command does not work, as I do not really want to "extend" anything, but to combine services from many files. Whould the include directive make sense?
