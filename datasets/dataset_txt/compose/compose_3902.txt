Does anybody know if Fig can handle two or more links to one container? For ex. I have two node apps and have to use one mongodb database. For now the second container just does not see mongodb :(
mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
        - "27017"
dos:
    build: ./democracyos
    links:
        - mongo
        - notifier
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
        - ./democracyos/app /app
notifier:
    build: ./notifier
    links:
        - mongo
    ports:
        - "9001"
    volumes:
        - ./notifier/app /app
The dos container exits with
Error: failed to connect to [undefined:27017]
Please advise!
