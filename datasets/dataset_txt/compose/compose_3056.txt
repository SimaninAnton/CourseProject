The environment variable system is return the string "None" when an environment variable is not set on the host. Example config file:
my_container:
  command: some_command
  environment:
    A_SIMPLE_ENV_VAR:
My host does not set A_SIMPLE_ENV_VAR and if I fig run my_container bash and then env | grep -i simple you will see that A_SIMPLE_ENV_VAR=None. That doesn't see correct to me because when you run os.environ.get('A_SIMPLE_ENV_VAR') in Python you get back the string None instead of blank. Setting it to a blank string here seems more reasonable because if/then statements work correctly.
