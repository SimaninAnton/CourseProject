I have two containers. App and Database.
I have them both join a network via networks
networks:                                                                                                                                    
  custom_network:                                                                                                                           
    driver: bridge                                                                                                                               
I also want to have "App" join the host network. The App has some features where it runs ifconfig things and needs to have access to the hosts network information.
How can I do this?
