josh@test:$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version: 1.4.2
josh@test:$ docker --version
Docker version 1.8.2, build 0a8c2e3
Steps to reproduce:
start a docker-compose up -d which runs 3 containers
tail the logs using docker-compose logs
in another terminal, use docker stop to shut down one of the containers
docker-compose logs will exit, even though 2 containers are still running
A minor annoyance, to be sure, but worth fixing when someone gets around to it.
