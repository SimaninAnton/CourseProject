Docker Compose has only --x-networking and --x-network-driver options. --x-networking creates a new bridge or overlay network depending upon where the application is targeted to.
It would be useful to have an option, similar to --net that would allow to target the entire Compose file to a pre-created network. Otherwise existing Compose files will have to be changed.
