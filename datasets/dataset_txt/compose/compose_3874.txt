Not sure what's going on here... but it appears that there may be some very weird hardcoded values in the code.
My docker-compose.yml:
web:
  build: .
  ports:
    "8080:8080"
  links:
    - "redisReads:redisReads"
    - "redisWrites:redisWrites"
    - "redisEphemeral:redisEphemeral"
redisReads:
  image: redis
redisWrites:
  image: redis
redisEphemeral:
  image: redis
and running:
compose stop && compose rm --force && compose build && compose up
results in:
Creating polka_redisEphemeral_1...
Creating polka_redisReads_1...
Creating polka_redisWrites_1...
Creating polka_web_1...
