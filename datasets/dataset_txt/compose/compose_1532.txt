Hello, I'm working at a docker-compose library for node. I'm trying to implement the up command . It's simply call "docker-compose up" by cmd-line. Approximately, this is the code :
return cmd.get('cd '+path+'; docker-compose  up', callback)      
It returns the pid process and the callback is called after the command. I'd like to get the output of docker-compose at runtime. The problem is that the end callback is called only when I destroy the containers with docker-compose down.
More simply,l if I try to call "docker-compose up > log.txt" from terminal, the process starts and remains active, but it doesn't redirect the output to log.txt :
docker-compose up > log.txt
Creating network "beginnerbov1_default" with the default driver

If there is a way to write those lines to log.txt I think that I've resolved this issue.
Thanks in advance!
