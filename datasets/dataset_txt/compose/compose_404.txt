Description of the issue
Tried to run docker-compose on a trivial docker-compose.yml, and it crashes with the error message given in the issue title . Unable to get it working on anything since upgrading from docker-compose-1.8.0 to docker-compose-1.23.1.

Additional information
OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
docker-compose was installed using pip3 install --user -U docker-compose on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS.
Seems related to this issue, which I did not find before writing the above: docker/docker-py#1916
I was able to fix the issue by doing pip3 uninstall docker-py docker and then redoing the installation of docker-compose.
Figure it is worth posting this issue to this tracker at least so that anyone else searching for it here finds this, even if the issue isn't actually with docker-compose itself. Perhaps this can be fixed by preventing the simultaneous installation of docker and docker-py or detecting this case?
