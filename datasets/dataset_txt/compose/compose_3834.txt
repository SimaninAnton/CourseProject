Creating an image with docker-compose up and shutting it down and subsequently deleting the underlying image results in next docker-compose up command erroring out with "No such image" error.
Steps to reproduce:
checkout https://github.com/toli/metc-docker, it's a Docker Compose setup with some bins and 2 underlying dependencies
run it with docker-compose up
Stop it
Remove the top-level built image with docker rm -f metcdocker_metc
Run docker-compose up again
You will see the error:
metc-docker> docker-compose up
Recreating metcdocker_mysql_1...
Recreating metcdocker_metc_1...
No such image: 19b5e447fe00 (tag: latest)
The referenced image was the first of deleted images:
toli@toli-docker:~/dev/marketcetera/metc-docker> docker rmi -f 19b5e447fe00
Untagged: metcdocker_metc:latest
Deleted: 19b5e447fe007b86dba74fd35b03d2ca4e12afbbad509274476ff907e7f96499
.....
toli:~/metc-docker> docker-compose up
Recreating metcdocker_mysql_1...
Recreating metcdocker_metc_1...
No such image: 19b5e447fe00 (tag: latest)
And the way to fix it is to run docker ps -a and delete the reference to the container that used that image
toli@toli:~/metc-docker> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS                    NAMES
154b0e044fc4        19b5e447fe00                         "/bin/sh -c ./start-   19 minutes ago      Exited (137) 18 minutes ago                            metcdocker_metc_1

toli@toli:~/metc-docker>docker rm 154b0e044fc4
154b0e044fc4
Even though the container has exited, it still seems to be referencing deleted image.
Running docker-container up again works after deleting the already-deleted image.
