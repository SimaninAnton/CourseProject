I have two machines, In A, I crate the overlay network :
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable --subnet 172.40.0.0/16 docker3
In other machine,
I want use it in the docker-compose.yml
networks:
  docker3:
    external:
      name: docker3
and then I use command
docker-compose up -d
the result is
ERROR: Network docker3 declared as external, but could not be found. Please create the network manually using docker network create docker3 and try again.
but I can use it in machines A, and use docker run -d --net=docker3 in machines B
Docker version 1.13.1
