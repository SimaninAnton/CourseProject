Is it possible to run a command in a running service (Docker container)? Here's my usecase:
I'm running Laravel as web (with a mounted /code folder) and a MySQL server as db. My default web command is php artisan serve, but I want to run php artisan migrate in the same container (to propagate the database). Also I need to make a backup script for the db service (to make sure no data gets lost).
Any way of doing these things with Fig?
One option would be to setup an SSH server in the web service, which allows me to open a new login shell. But I was wondering if their is a better of doing this?
