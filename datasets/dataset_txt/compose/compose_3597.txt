Thanks to @albers and @sdurrheimer, we now have both bash and zsh completion, which is fantastic. However, they (understandably) both do a lot of hacky stuff to read the YAML file without actually parsing YAML properly, and they both implement this separately.
We could potentially add some commands/flags to Compose that would give them the information they need in a simple shell-parseable format. Going off a quick scan of the bash script, it looks like it'd be useful to be able to list:
names of all services in the file
names of all services that have a given configuration option set - here, we'd even be able to evaluate extends to get the correct configuration, which I doubt would be any fun at all to implement in shell script
names of services that have at least one running container
names of services that have at least one stopped container
Perhaps a docker-compose services command:
$ docker-compose services
web
redis

$ docker-compose services --with-option="build"
web

$ docker-compose services --with-running-container
redis
