Version:
docker-compose version 1.11.2, build dfed245
I want to set the environment variable VAR1 in the compose file to an empty string, rather than having it unset.
version: '2'

services:
 srv1:
  image: myimagename
  environment:
  - VAR1=
However, with this setting in the docker compose file the variable VAR1 turns out to be unset once I run the container.
If I use - VAR1="" then the value of VAR1 inside the container is ""
If I use - VAR1=${UNSET} then VAR1 inside the container is unset
If I use - VAR1: ${UNSET} I get the error services.rec.environment contains {"VAR1": ""}, which is an invalid type, it should be a string
Thus: how to assign an empty string to a variable in docker-compose?
