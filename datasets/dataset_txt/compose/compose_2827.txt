Compose 1.6 silently ignore the "networks" option when the service extends from another one.
This version 2 docker file :
version: '2'
services:
  foo:
    image: busybox
    command: echo foo
  bar:
   extends: foo
   command: echo bar
   networks:
      - mynetwork
networks:
  mynetwork:
Results in the following resolved config after loading:
networks:
  mynetwork: {}
services:
  bar:
    command: echo bar
    image: busybox
  foo:
    command: echo foo
    image: busybox
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
The "bar" container is not attach to "mynetwork".
