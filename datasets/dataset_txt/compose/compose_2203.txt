In a docker machine, docker compose up has some auth config error, but its unclear what this error exactly is. Would nice to know which file this is looking for e.g.
$ docker-compose --verbose -p webapp up 
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: ./docker-compose.yml
docker.api.build._set_auth_headers: Looking for auth config
docker.api.build._set_auth_headers: No auth config in memory - loading from filesystem
docker.auth.auth.load_config: File doesn't exist
docker.api.build._set_auth_headers: No auth config found
