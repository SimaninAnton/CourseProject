It seems 1.6 changed the links merging behaviour:
If you have a.yml:
web:
  image: nginx
  environment:
    - DEBUG=1
  cpu_shares: 5
  links:
  - db
db:
  image: postgres
and b.yml:
web:
  links: []
  external_links:
    - foodb:db
It seems "links" for web is now ['db'], this is different 1.5's behaviour where the b.yml will override links.
I can see that links are merged with local names, however the use case here is to override existing links with external_links, which doesn't seem to be possible now.
Perhaps we can make external_links part of the merging logic, where foodb:db cancels existing db.
