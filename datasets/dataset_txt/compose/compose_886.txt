I have always used Docker Compose as a container, as described here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-as-a-container.
But it became unusable since 1.19.0.
When I run docker-compose exec I get the following error:
ERROR: Couldn't find `docker` binary. You might need to install Docker:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
I have the docker binary on my host system.
