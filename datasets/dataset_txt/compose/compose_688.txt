Hello, fellows!
I'm trying to use docker-compose to run a composition with node server and a mongodb, which must use a docker volume to store its data. However, when I execute the docker-compose down command, I lose all data that I've saved once before. When I docker volume list, I'm able to list the volume created by docker-compose.
I don't want to set a place in the host server to have the mongo data, if I use the ./data path as volume, data is persistent. However I want to easily manipulate it with docker volume and such..
Here's a sample
version: '3.4'
services:
  nodeserver:
    build: .
    container_name: "c-name"
    ports:
      - 3001:3001
      - 80:80
    links:
      - mongodb
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
  mongodb:
    image: mvertes/alpine-mongo (if I use mongo I get the same behavior)
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/var/data
    container_name: "mongodb-service"
    ports:
     - 27017:27017
volumes:
  mongo-data:
Versions:
docker-compose: 1.21.1
docker: 18.04.0-ce, build 3d479c0af6
system: Linux
Thanks in advance
