Take a look here:
compose/compose/cli/main.py
Line 550 in 1655be6
 if IS_WINDOWS_PLATFORM and not detach: 
Is there any chance the check performed here could be refined so that if the user is running via cmder/conemu or another Windows terminal, interactive mode run isn't blocked?
I'm actually calling docker-compose from an msys2 bash terminal run via cmder. Perhaps that's enough to satisfy what's needed for interactive mode?
