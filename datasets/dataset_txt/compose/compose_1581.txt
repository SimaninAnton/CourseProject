I couldn't find an existing issue for this, so here goes...
I updated from Compose 1.8.0 to 1.11.2 yesterday and I could no longer start my containers. The following warning was displayed:
WARNING: no logs are available with the 'awslogs' log driver
My docker-compose.yml file is using the awslogs log driver like this:
services:
www:
  logging:
    driver: awslogs
    options:
      awslogs-group: 'Production'
      awslogs-stream: 'www'
After some debugging and tracing through the code that creates that warning, I came across the following issue and pull request which was part of the Docker Compose 1.8.1 release:
#3873
#3942
This appears to be the cause of my issue. It sounds like support for log drivers was dropped except for 'json-file' and 'journald'.
I see that the original issue (#3873) points to this as the rationale: https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/#limitations-of-logging-drivers
I'm not sure I understand this... could someone provide more context on this decision? Docker itself supports logging to many different logging drivers. Docker Compose should too.
Does Docker Compose rely on the docker logs command for its log streaming? Can someone point me to some code so I can understand this better? Is there any other way? Not being able to use the full features of Docker's logging drivers is a big missing piece from Docker Compose right now.
