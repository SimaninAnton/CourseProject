problem
when wanting to deploy dedicated app clusters to clients through templating the orchestration yaml-files, the question is, how do i easly setup the dns for this.
proposal
there are great services such as dnssimple with an api. hashicorp's competing tool terraform has got some additionals "outside world" providers like said dnssimple
rational
If I might decide to go with fig/composer, and decide against beeing system agnostic, because I just know I want to do all I do the docker way - for some whatever reason - I might also want to be able to set up adjacent services such as DNS and probably mailchimp or similar...
