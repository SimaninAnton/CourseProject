Description of the issue
I have set up a remote Docker host in a KVM guest system based on the Ubuntu cloud image.
When using the SSH protocol to access the Docker host by setting DOCKER_HOST=ssh://root@whale1 on my client system I can manage the remote Docker images and containers. Creating, starting and stopping containers with docker-compose also works.
However, when running docker-compose build with a Compose file containing more than one build option, the second build fails. Building the second image explicitly with docker-compose build SERVICE works fine.
So I assume the SSH connection is lost after the first build.
