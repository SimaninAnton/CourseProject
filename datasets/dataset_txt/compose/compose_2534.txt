As per https://docs.docker.com/v1.9/compose/env/
Using this file
version: '2'

services:
    legacyBackend:
        image: someimage:latest
        volumes:
            - /var/www/backend
        ports:
            - "8100:80"
            - "8101:81"
            - "3315:3306"
        tty: true

    app:
        image: anotherimage:latest
        links:
            - legacyBackend
        volumes:
            - /var/www/app
        ports:
            - "8104:4200"
        tty: true
I would expect $APP_PORT to be a available env variable inside the legacyBackend service, and I would expect $LEGACYBACKEND_PORT to be available inside the app service.
Which as you can see in the image above, is not the case.
You can however ping the app service:
But you cant echo it to get a IP:
Listing the env variables:
Using inspect, the "Links" value is null, alltough they are clearly defined in docker-compose.yml and they work with the ping command:
I'm not sure how I can get a linked containers network address when the documented env variables are not available. A common use case is for REST based mobile apps, where you need to sed config files with correct ip's in a local environment setup.
