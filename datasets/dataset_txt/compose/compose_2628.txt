Docker compose seems to mount a host directory on the container. Is it possible to mount a container directory on the host.
For example, the official drupal image I am using in the below docker-compose.yml already downloads a version of the Drupal CMS to /var/www/html and when I try to mount the volume using ./drupal:/var/www/html it wipes the drupal install on the container. What is the recommended approach for this?
  # Drupal official image => drupal:version
  image: drupal:7.43-apache
  ports:
    # Host machine's port 8000 will map to Drupal's port 80
    - "8000:80"
  volumes:
    # Drupal should live in the "drupal" directory
    - ./drupal:/var/www/html:rw
    - ./docker-compose.sh:/docker-compose.sh
  links:
    - mysql:mysql
    - solr:solr
  working_dir: /var/www/html
