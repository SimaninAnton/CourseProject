Issues with Compose pointing at an Engine running on Windows (i.e. Windows containers) are collected under the group/windows-server label. The Compose client could be running on either Linux or Windows.
This is a list of things we want to deliver for Compose 1.8 related to Windows Engine.
Networking doesn't work with Windows containers due to disconnecting containers from networks #3252
Windows volume paths don't work #2487 (we can look at how docker-cli does it)
Support npipe for docker host #3170
