The Java spring-boot library accepts core config through a standardized set of environment variables. Spring boot provides a mechanism to convert their properties to environment, see here. Some of these standard spring properties have dashes in them.
These properties worked under previous versions of compose but are no longer allowed in 1.5. Running a compose file like this
app:
  build: .
  expose:
   - "80"
  links:
    - db:db
  environment:
    - SERVER_PORT=80
    - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/demo
    - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=username
    - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=password
    - SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER-CLASS-NAME=org.postgresql.Driver
    - SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL-AUTO=none
Now fails with the error
Service 'app' configuration key 'environment' contains unsupported option: 'SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL-AUTO'
