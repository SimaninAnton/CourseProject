When recreating containers with docker-compose up, it seems that docker-compose runs the docker stop command prior to re-creating the new containers if there already were existing containers. This means that first a SIGTERM signal is sent to shutdown the container.
I would like the option to specify which signal is sent when containers are being stopped prior to being recreated, such as a SIGQUIT, so containers running php-fpm and nginx can be stopped gracefully.
Example:
docker-compose up -d -s SIGQUIT
Thoughts?
