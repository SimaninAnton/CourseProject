In Windows, the Getting Started example works correctly only if the working directory is under the user's home directory (C:\users\username). Otherwise, it fails with the message:
python: can't open file 'app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
which occurs because the /code directory is empty in the container.
The example Dockerfile is:
FROM python:2.7
ADD . /code
WORKDIR /code
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD python app.py
and docker-compose.yml contains:
volumes:
  - .:/code
A standard Docker build produces a working container (that is, /code/app.py exists) regardless of the working directory. However, docker-compose up creates a working image only if run from C:\users\username or one of its subdirectories.
