Setting /d/certs/cluster1 for DOCKER_CERT_PATH results in this error:
$ winpty docker-compose exec nginx bash
ERROR: TLS configuration is invalid - make sure your DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKE
R_CERT_PATH are set correctly.
You might need to run `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"`
While using D:\\certs\\cluster1 works as expected:
$ winpty docker-compose exec nginx bash
bash-4.3# 
Tested with compose 1.10.
