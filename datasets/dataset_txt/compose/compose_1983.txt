Hey,
I'm running docker at:
Docker version 1.12.2, build bb80604
and docker-compose at:
docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
I don't see any output (from container) in the console when I run "docker-compose run ..."
To reproduce create this simple docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
    hello:
        image: 'alpine'
run it like that:
docker-compose build
docker-compose run hello echo "hello"
I've also tried adding -T parameter:
docker-compose run -T hello echo "hello"
but it doesn't help.
When I run docker without compose then it works fine:
docker run alpine echo "hello"
hello
