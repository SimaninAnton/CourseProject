Docker version 17.09.0-ce, build afdb6d4
docker-compose version 1.17.0-rc1, build a0f95af
Problem
Setting timeout on docker-compose up does not affect the shutdown timeout
docker-compose.yml file
version: "3.3"
services:
  test2:
    image: debian:9
    command: nohup sleep 1000
(Also tried with version 2.0, and 2.3)
$ docker-compose up -d --timeout 123 test2
$ docker inspect issue_test2_1 # Shows no StopTimeout set at all
$ time docker-compose stop
Stopping issue_test2_1 ... done

real 0m11.473s
user 0m0.908s
sys 0m0.144s
(Also tried down)
Expected behavior
$ docker run -it --rm --stop-timeout=121 --name test1 debian:9 nohup sleep 1000
$ docker inspect test1 # Show a StopTimeout of 121 set in the "Config" section
$ docker stop test1 # takes the ~121 seconds
Other
Using stop_grace_period does work when using docker-compose commands, but not docker commands, as it appears that docker-compose stop or down just re-reads the docker-compose.yml file at stop time, and has nothing to do with how the container was started
Objective
I am trying to set the StopTimeout in the actual container, so the daemon knows what to respect when it is shutdown (for example during a full system shutdown). Something like stop_grace_period doesn't help me, as that only tells docker-compose how long to wait, not the docker daemon.
