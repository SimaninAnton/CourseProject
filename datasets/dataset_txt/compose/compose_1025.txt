I have compose file with the following:
      cache_from:
        - ${IMAGE_NAME}:development
        - ${IMAGE_NAME}:${REVISION}
This works great for CI because I pull the development version of that image (which is the most recent) and optionally one tagged with the commit hash. CI uses the layers and builds are fast.
When building locally, I don't have an image tagged as :development and every time the commit hash changes (HEAD changes) it does not reuse the layers. Even if I bite the bullet and pull every time (it could take 30+s on a slow connection) I lose all the caching on the layers I changed until next CI run (will tag :development).
Is there a way to tell compose to use the local layers + cache_from? If not is there a smart workaround for this use case?
