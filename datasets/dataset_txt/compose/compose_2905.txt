If an image has a volume defined you cannot override it in the yml file, but the user does not get any error or warning.
Take the example of this file below. the volume entry to map your local file system but this is ignored because in the official mongo image a docker volume was created for /data/db.
docker-compose.yml :
mongodb:
  image: mongo:latest
  container_name: mongodb2
  command: mongod --smallfiles
  ports:
   - "27017:27017"
  volumes:
  - ./mongo:/data/db
  volume_driver: local
Docker file for mongo that defines the volume that cannot be overridden:
https://github.com/docker-library/mongo/blob/358d9eb62895be2c9fd4290595573c93b79d47d4/3.2/Dockerfile
