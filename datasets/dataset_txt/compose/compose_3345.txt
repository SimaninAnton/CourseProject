Using docker 1.6.2 and docker-compose 1.3.3, I occasionally get this error on docker-compose up for one of the containers it tries to spin up. I think this happens more when I do a docker load on a saved image before but not 100% certain on that.
Here's the callstack. It's not a blocking issue since it's intermittent but a better error message handling this exception would be nice
