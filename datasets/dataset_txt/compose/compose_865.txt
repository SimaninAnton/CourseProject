I just setup a jenkins server and I noticed that my builds failed because my docker-compose setup did not boot at all ! Here is the command that blocks everything.
jenkins@windoo-jenkins:~/workspace/Windoo Saas$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
Building php_test
Traceback (most recent call last):

My docker-compose version:
docker-compose version 1.19.0, build 9e633ef
docker-py version: 2.7.0
CPython version: 2.7.13
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016
On my pc it works like a charm with this configuration:
docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
docker-py version: 2.6.1
CPython version: 2.7.13
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016
It may have link with docker/docker-py#1841 ? But this issue is closed so I don't know..
