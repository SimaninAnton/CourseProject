Description of the issue
docker-compose outputs an misleading/ wrong error message, if an invalid image name is specified for an service (e.g. with an uppercase letter in the repository name).
For an invalid name, like
image: pkap/gBridge-redis-worker:latest   #note the uppercase 'B'
docker-compose build outputs:
[...]
Building redis-worker
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
The build succeeds for
image: pkap/gbridge-redis-worker:latest   #note the lowercase 'b'
This error message seems to be somehow unrelated to the actual issue. Though this is not critical, I'd like to draw attention to this behaviour.
Since I'm a total Docker beginner (and didn't know about image naming conventions), it took me some time to figure out the problem.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Use docker-compose.yml with invalid image name:
image: pkap/gBridge-redis-worker:latest   #note the uppercase 'B'
Observed result
[...]
Building redis-worker
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
Expected result
(Analogous to) "Error: Image name does not comply with the naming restrictions"
