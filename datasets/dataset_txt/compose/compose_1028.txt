I have a docker-compose.yml version 3 which works very good:
version: '3'

services:

  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  
redis:
    image: redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  app:
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: bash ./script.sh
    volumes:
      - bundle:/bundle
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "1234:1234"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true

volumes:

  bundle: {}
I use it with Rails and I debug attaching from Windows port 1234. Everything works good.
But.
Sometimes my Rails server crash. It happens. So I need the app container restart itself. And it does. But I loose the logs in my powershell console.
When starting with docker-compose up I see everything.
When the app container crash and restart itself I don't see anything from the "new" app container. Why?
If I close manually that app container and start it manually all logs from the before restarted container appears again scrolling down like the Niagara Falls!
Bug? My own bug?
