I have a simple docker-compose file
version: '3'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
  backup:
    image: postgres-backup
    depends_on:
      - postgres
When I run the backup service and suppress its output, it still writes not error messages to stdout:
✗ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run backup > /dev/null
Starting test_postgres_1 ...
Starting test_postgres_1 ... done
This is not expected behavior since Starting test_postgres_1 message does not look like an error. I understand the motivation of writing docker compose messages not to stdout. But I expect that stderr contains errors. For example, when I run backup using cron, I want to suppress stdout and receive error messages via email. But currently, I receive "Starting test_postgres_1" which obviously is not error messages.
It would be very helpful to have control over docker compose output while automating things.
