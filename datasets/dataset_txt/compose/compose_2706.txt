extends doc explains specific merge rules that apply to image and build:
In the case of build and image, using one in the local service causes Compose to discard the other, if it was defined in the original service.
Since compose 1.6.0 and Compose File format v2 this limitation is not needed anymore because both image and build may be defined at the same time.
After testing it appears that extends has already relaxed this and merges with usual rules.
The documentation should be updated to reflect this.
