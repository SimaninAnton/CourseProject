I'm trying to run a replica mongodb project. If I add links under the "replica1" service as
links:
replica2
arbiter
and then underneath the "replica2" service add links like this
links:
replica1
arbiter
I get error "Circular import between replica1 and replica2". Although, if I specify all the links under "replica1" it at least runs but the other services do not get the links in the hosts file. Is this a bug?
