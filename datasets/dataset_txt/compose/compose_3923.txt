You are able to add a environment section to an image to assign environment variables to it.
What I would like to be able to do is set a env var across all my containers, e.g.
enviroment:
  app_env: staging
app:
  image: app-one
other:
  image: app-other
I guess this is a feature request as I believe this can't be done atm?
