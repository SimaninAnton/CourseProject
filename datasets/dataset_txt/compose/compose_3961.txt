Hi,
I'd like to know if there are some plans for support Fig on Windows (as Docker: https://ahmetalpbalkan.com/blog/compiling-docker-cli-on-windows/).
I've installed fig with python and pip, but I get problems with these libraries:
termios
fcntl
And I don't know if there are more.
Thanks in advance.
Best,
Jorge
