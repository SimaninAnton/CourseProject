Using the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2.1'
services:
  db:
    image: "<my_image>"
    healthcheck:
      disable: true
I get the following error when running docker-compose up :
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for services.db: 'healthcheck'
According to the documentation, "healthcheck" should be supported with the currently installed versions:
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.13.0, build 49bf474
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
