Right now, validation errors don't include the filename, which will make problems hard to track down if you're using multiple files.
Of course, we can't validate files in isolation because override files aren't required to be valid standalone Compose files, which makes this complicated.
Perhaps we could do something like this (pseudocode):
config = load_config(filenames[0])
# on failure, will output an error message specifying the name of the first file
validate_config(config, filenames[0])

for filename in filenames[1:]:
    config = merge_config(config, filename)
    # on failure, will output an error message specifying the name of the current file
    validate_config(config, filename)
