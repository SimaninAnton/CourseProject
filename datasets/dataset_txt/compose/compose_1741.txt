I just installed the native docker for MAC OS. (had been using docker-machine for a few years). I can no longer "docker exec it <containter_id>" for containers launched via docker-compose who have links to transient containers(ie come up and run and exit, like to hydrate a database for example). I now get the "Error response from daemon: Cannot link to a non running container: AS error.
Steps to reproduce:
Create a docker compose file that defines 2 containers(A,B) and has a link to container B from container A.
Have container B run a trivial command and exit
docker-compose up
docker exec -it /bin/bash
5)Notice this error
Error response from daemon: Cannot link to a non running container: AS error.

Docker version :: 1.13.0, build 49bf474
docker-compose version :: 1.10.0, build 4bd6f1a
I hope there is a work around that does require the complication of docker networks. Frustrated to see this regression.
