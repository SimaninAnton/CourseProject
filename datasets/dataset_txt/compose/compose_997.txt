this is my config:
version: '3.2'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: .
        target: /app
it throws the error after building the image:
ERROR: for example_app_1  mounts param is not supported in API versions < 1.30

ERROR: for rails-app  mounts param is not supported in API versions < 1.30
