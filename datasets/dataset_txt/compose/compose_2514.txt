1.7.0-rc1 is called different things in different places
Download URL: 1.7.0-rc1
docker-compose -v: 1.7.0rc1 (NB: no dash, doesn't match download URL)
docker-compose version: 1.7.0rc1 (same as -v)
I'm happy enough for the version specifier to not have a dash, but if we're going to do that can we at least make the download URL also not have one?
As it is, having these inconsistent version numbers makes it awkward to ensure the correct version of docker-compose is installed in configuration management; you have to somehow map the version number you'll get from docker-compose version to the download URL, or vice versa.
