In the process of migrating to Docker for Windows from Docker Toolbox. Docker functionality is working the same, however, docker-compose is running into issues.
Here is my test docker-compose file.
docker-compose.yml
version: "2"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
Running docker-compose up on this config results in the following output
PS> docker-compose --verbose up
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: .\docker-compose.yml
docker.auth.auth.load_config: Found 'auths' section
docker.auth.auth.parse_auth: Auth data for {0} is absent. Client might be using a credentials store instead.
docker.auth.auth.load_config: Found 'credsStore' section

  File "json\decoder.py", line 382, in raw_decode
ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded
docker-compose returned -1
The output isn't very helpful as it doesn't specify what JSON could not be decoded. I'm not sure if this is a docker configuration file somewhere else on my system or an internal docker-compose configuration file.
Here is my docker config file, although it is pretty plain.
{
    "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
    },
    "credsStore": "wincred"
}
