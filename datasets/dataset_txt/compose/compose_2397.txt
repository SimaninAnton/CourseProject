I was following the guide in https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/ but I had duplicate port lines in both files. This lead to "address already in use" erorrs!
docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    image: alpine:3.3
    ports:
      - "1234:1234"
    command: nc -l 1234
docker-compose.prod.yml
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    ports:
      - "1234:1234"
command and output
% docker-compose --project=test -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
Starting test_test_1
