I found a problem that an invalid compose file because of an invalid service name in some-cases throws an error in the output about a totally valid service instead of the real problematic one.
.yaml file:
version: '2'
services:
    redis:2.8.6:
      image: 'redis'

    cfloggercon:
      image: 'redis'
output:
ERROR: The Compose file './test.yml' is invalid because:
Invalid service name 'cfloggercon' - only [a-zA-Z0-9\._\-] characters are allowed
Clearly the cfloggercon is totally legit.
