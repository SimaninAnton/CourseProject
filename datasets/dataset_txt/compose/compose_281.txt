Description of the issue
Lets say we have below docker compose file:
version: '2.1'
services:
main:
image: sandeepgupta2k4/main:latest
depends_on:
container1:
condition: service_healthy
container1:
image: sandeepgupta2k4/container1:latest
healthcheck:
test: "test -f /dummyfile.txt"
Dockerfile - container 1 and main
FROM alpine:latest
ADD start.sh /
CMD ["/bin/sh", "start.sh"]
start.sh - container1
echo "Inside container 1"
sleep 20
echo "dummy data" > /dummyfile.txt
sleep 60
start.sh - main
echo "Inside main container"
Full code can be found here : https://github.com/sandeepgupta2k4/experiment
Now when we do "docker-compose up"
It will wait till startup for the main container gets triggered before displaying any logs on the console. Ideally logs should start showing up as soon as startup for container1 is triggered.
Due to this problem, in case there is any issue in start up of container1, we get error like below:
ERROR: for main Container "f7d0e1fe8282" is unhealthy.
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
With this we cannot really figure out what really went wrong with container1, Also in case of many containers, we may not even know which container actually failed.
