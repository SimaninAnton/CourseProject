I run in a terminal docker-compose up
and it prints to console the log entries for all contains.
But if in another terminal I run docker-compose logs api to print log entires of one single container, then it prints to the console some more entry that it was not printed in the first terminal.
This creates quite enough confusion to me, and it makes me think that docker-compose is not a reliable tool.
