http://docs.docker.com/compose/ is currently the landing page for Compose. A few things this page doesn't cater for:
Somebody wants some help using Compose, in which case we should point them at the mailing list or IRC channel
Somebody wants to suggest features, report bugs or contribute code, in which case we should point them at GitHub
I think we should have links off to those things somewhere. @aanand @fredlf - WDYT?
