I am experimenting using docker-compose for a cassandra cluster and pin the instance to a specific core. I have a docker-compose.yaml (below).
When I run it on a ubuntu box (24 core ec2 instance), it gives me "Bind mounts must be absolute paths"
(master) [origin ] $ docker-compose -p cluster up -d
Creating network "cluster_default" with the default driver
Recreating cassandra-seed1
ERROR: for cassandra-seed1 Bind mounts must be absolute paths.
However, if I pin all cpus to cpuset 0, it has no error. Very strange behavior. I think the bind mounts should only be relevant to file system
