On my OSX (10.9, Docker 1.1.0, boot2docker 1.1.0) the tutorial that is on Fig homepage (http://orchardup.github.io/fig/) gives a following log resulting in exit code 2 (see end).
I'm not sure what to do, because I don't use python at all and I'm new to Docker..
It looks like the /code dir is not created, because docker run cdc18ed4ed6f ls /code results in cannot access /code: No such file or directory.
