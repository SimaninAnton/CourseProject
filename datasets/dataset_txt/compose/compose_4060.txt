When environment variables are configured in the fig.yml file like so:
environment:
  - MIX_ENV=test
running fig run -e MIX_ENV=dev causes python to throw up because it tries to treat the environment options like a dictionary instead of a list.
Translating the environment settings to:
environment:
  MIX_ENV: test
resolves the error.
The relevant line in the source is cli/main.py#318.
