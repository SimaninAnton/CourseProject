I just upgraded from 1.1.0 to 1.3.2, and after dealing with the /tmp directory being mounted as noexec (issue #1339), I ran into another issue that I couldn't find in the backlog;
$ docker-compose up -d

TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable
Downgrading to 1.3.1 seems to alleviate this behavior.
