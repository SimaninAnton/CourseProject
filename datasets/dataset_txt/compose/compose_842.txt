I've been using the multi-stage builds in order to reduce the number of Dockerfile in my project as well as having the leanest possible images for production.
My current set-up is a main Dockerfile.prod for production that essentially ends up in a FROM scratch running a binary.
I also have another Dockerfile.dev for development that have dev tools and package like linter, test suite, etc.. It also have a CMD that rebuild on change. This Dockerfile.dev is pretty much the same as the build stage of Dockerfile.prod.
While trying to find a way to get rid of Dockerfile.dev I found stop-at-a-specific-build-stage option for docker build cmd.
Unfortunately it looks like that compose doesn't support it yet.
This option would help me reduce again the number of docker related file per project.
It would be possible for me to have a:
docker-compose.yml for prod
version: "3.4"
services:

  app:
    image: app:prod
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
docker-compose.override.yml for dev
version: "3.4"
services:

  app:
    image: app:dev
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      target: build-stage
