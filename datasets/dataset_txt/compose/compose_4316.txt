I have an app that could potentially have a few different commands run within it, and all of them are required for development purposes. Is there a way I can have fig just launch to a bash process? Something like:
web:
  build: .
  command: /bin/bash
  links:
   - db
   - redis
db:
  image: orchardup/postgresql
redis:
  image: orchardup/redis
