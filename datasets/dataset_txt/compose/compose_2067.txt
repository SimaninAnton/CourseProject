I'm trying to create a "defaults" block in docker-compose.yml so that I can use that definition in my other services..
However, docker-compose doesn't allow any keys other than "services" at the root.
It would nice to be able to define blocks outside services for this purpose..
minimal example:
version: '2'

default: &default
  image: my_app
  build: .    
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  environment:      
    RAILS_ENV: development
    DATABASE_URL: mysql2://dba:abcd1234@10.0.0.1/my_database

services:      
  app:
    <<: *default
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: /app/docker-up.sh

  delayed_job_default:
    <<: *default
    command: bin/delayed_job --queue default run
In the actual config in my application, I ended up defining default within services and giving it a dummy command, like echo "not a service"
