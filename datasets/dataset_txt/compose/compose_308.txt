Hey folks,
I just installed docker-compose on my Elementary OS 5 machine (Ubuntu-based) and I'm getting the following output when typing docker-compose:
zsh: exec format error: docker-compose
If I type which docker-compose I do get the correct path I believe:
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
And I simlinked that just in case to /usr/bin/docker-compose which is where docker is kept (as suggested by the docs).
Strangely enough if I run sudo docker-compose I get
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose: 1: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
Any thoughts on what could be happening ?
