Per SO post with noluck: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45527969/unable-to-bind-windows-environment-variables-to-docker-compose-environment
I currently have a compose file for a Windows .Net service, and I want to be able to pass through a user-space environment variable:
Set from powershell:
powershell [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE\", $env:computername, \"User\")
(i've also tried "machine" space env variables as well using the above).
To test after running the above:
echo %PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE% from a new command prompt window.
Docker compose file:
    services:
      myservice.commandline:
        image: myservice.commandline:dev
        build:
          args:
            source: ${DOCKER_BUILD_SOURCE}
        volumes:
          - .\myservice.commandline:C:\app
          - ~\msvsmon:C:\msvsmon:ro
        entrypoint: powershell -Command [System.Threading.Thread]::Sleep([System.Threading.Timeout]::Infinite)
        environment:
          - MY_VARIABLE_NAME=${PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE}
        labels:
          - "com.microsoft.visualstudio.targetoperatingsystem=windows"
This does not work - the environment variable shows as blank.
- MY_VARIABLE_NAME=${PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE} doesn't work.
Is it possible to pass a windows environment variable through to a Docker Compose environment variable? This is easily accomplished using the *nix version of compose, so hoping i've just missed something.
Background:
${PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE} doesn't work.
$PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE doesn't work.
$(PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE) doesn't work.
${%PREVIOUSLY_SET_WINDOWS_ENV_VARIABLE%} doesn't work.
