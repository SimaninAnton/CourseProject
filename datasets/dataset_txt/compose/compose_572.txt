Description of the issue
I have a few volumes, some should be mounted inside folders of already defined (and expected to be mounted) volumes, but it seems (with --verbose) docker-compose uses some different logic than the order of which volumes mounts is declared.
Context information (for bug reports)
volumes:
          # data
          - $PWD/mounts/abc-wpfrontend:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp
          # data from production nas
          - /Volumes/DataHD/frontendwp/wp-content/plugins:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp/wp-content/plugins
          - /Volumes/DataHD/frontendwp/wp-content/uploads:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp/wp-content/uploads
          # logs
          - $PWD/logs/frontendwp/supervisor:/var/log/supervisor
          - $PWD/logs/frontendwp/apache2:/var/log/apache2
          - $PWD/logs/frontendwp/newrelic:/var/log/newrelic
From --verbose log:
compose.cli.verbose_proxy.proxy_callable: docker create_host_config -> {'Binds': ['/Volumes/WebDevHD/abc-dev-env/logs/frontendwp/supervisor:/var/log/supervisor:rw',
           '/Volumes/WebDevHD/abc-dev-env/logs/frontendwp/apache2:/var/log/apache2:rw',
           '/Volumes/DataHD/frontendwp/wp-content/plugins:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp/wp-content/plugins:rw',
           '/Volumes/WebDevHD/abc-dev-env/mounts/abc-wpfrontend:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp:rw',
           '/Volumes/WebDevHD/abc-dev-env/logs/frontendwp/newrelic:/var/log/newrelic:rw',
           '/Volumes/DataHD/frontendwp/wp-content/uploads:/srv/cms/thecode/public_html/frontendwp/wp-content/uploads:rw'],
