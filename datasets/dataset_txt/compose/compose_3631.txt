It would be nice if the extend(s): directive in the docker-compose.yml were able to extend from another docker-compose.yml from a URI. That we we can build up libraries of common things and services defined in a common place that's web accessible.
e.g:
extends: http://mydomain.com/mypaas.yml

service1:
    ...

service2:
    ...
Here I"m talking about "extending" the local docker-compose.yml to "bring in" and include services/definitions from an external file.
