Hi,
I'm trying to set the log configuration for my container through docker-compose. This is how my YAML file looks like:
db:
  image: mariadb
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  log_opt:
    max-size: "1m"
    max-file: "20"
  ports:
    - 3306:3306
But when I inspect my container using the command:
docker inspect --format='{{json .HostConfig.LogConfig}}' docker_db_1
It says the log config is empty:
{"Type":"json-file","Config":{}}
I also checked the log location (available in the field .LogPath) and I confirmed that my container log is not following the parameters that I set in the YAML file -- the log keeps growing indefinitely.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or if I'm doing something wrong. Please, help.
