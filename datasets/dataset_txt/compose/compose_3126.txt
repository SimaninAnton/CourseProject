I switched one of my projects to use version 1.5.0 with Python 3.4, and hit a subtle problem related to the hash randomization feature introduced in Python 3.3.
One of the effects is that docker-compose up keeps recreating some of the services, even if nothing has been changed in their configuration.
The problem disappear executing export PYTHONHASHSEED=0 (actually, any value except the default 'random') before running docker-compose.
I created a tiny example that demonstrate the problem: https://github.com/lelit/docker-compose-config-ordering-issue-demo
