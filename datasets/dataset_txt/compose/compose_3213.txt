I'm very confused about how docker-compose is supposed to work on my Mac. Here are the steps I took:
Installed Docker Toolbox (Docker version 1.8.2)
Tried to run docker-compose up but got Illegal instruction: 4 error as per #1885
To fix the issue, I installed docker-compose with pip via sudo pip install -U docker-compose
Now when I run docker-compose up I get Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to runboot2docker up.
Which is very confusing because all the documentation says that boot2docker is deprecated. And trying to install boot2docker isn't working for me either.
I'm not sure what else to try. Currently have docker-compose v1.4.2 installed.
