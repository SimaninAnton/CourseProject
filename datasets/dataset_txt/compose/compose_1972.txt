I have an issue with a service (minio/minio) when running in Docker and would like to connect to a minio server running on my host to debug the issue:
local:
  image: filepunk:test
  external_links:
    - blockai_postgres_1:db
      # - blockai_minio_1:minio
  command: >
    /bin/bash -c "
      npm run knex -- migrate:latest && npm test
    "
  environment:
    - PG_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://postgres@db/filepunk-test
    # - AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000
    - AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=http://<IP OF HOST HERE>:9000
Is there any env variable for <IP OF HOST HERE> or any other way to achieve this?
