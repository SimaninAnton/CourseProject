I setup a bunch of different web services in diffferent docker-compose.yml, and now I'm trying to put a reverse proxy in front of them using nginx as a compose service. To connect them together I'm using networks (external) and external links. The problem is that the nginx service is not responding on ports 80/443 publicly, however if I add a second nginx service inside the same docker-compose.yml I can answer on nginx1 proxy to nginx2 and then proxy to my external services.
Here is my docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  lb:
    restart: always
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./lb.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./lb-nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    links:
      - nginx:frontend
  nginx:
    restart: always
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/certs:ro
    networks:
      - default # required or you won't be able to talk to the outside
      - minio
      - pinba
      - registry
    external_links:
      - "minio_minio_1:minio"
      - "pinba_pinboard_1:pinboard"
      - "registry_registry-ui_1:registry-ui"
networks:
  minio:
    external:
      name: minio_default
  pinba:
    external:
     name: pinba_default
  registry:
    external:
      name: registry_default
_This is the part not working as I expected:_
    networks:
      - default # required or you won't be able to talk to the outside
The version above works, but if I try to remove lb and add ports 80/433 to nginx, I can't access the services publicly.
Also I tried with ufw enabled and disabled.
