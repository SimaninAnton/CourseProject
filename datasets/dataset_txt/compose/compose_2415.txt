Summary
Enhancement request that environment variables set from within the docker-compose.yml file could be used elsewhere.
This would make docker-compose more dynamic instead of current static nature. Right now have to compose some wrapper script to compose docker-compose to compose containers.
Docker-Compose file examples
version: '2'
services:
  database:
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_VERSION="9.4"
    image: "postgres:${POSTGRES_VERSION}"
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    environment:
      - APP_ROOT="/app"
    build: .
    command: ${APP_ROOT}/wrapper.sh
    volumes:
      - ./logs/:${APP_ROOT}/logs
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
