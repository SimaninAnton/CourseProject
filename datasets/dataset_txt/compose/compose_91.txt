Hi. The main idea of this feature request is the ability to specify a list of files on which image depends and rebuilds automatically.
It can be really helpful to just declaratively tell a service, when I want it to rebuild
How it can be used ?
For example we have a simple nodejs service.
webapp:
    image: webapp-dev
    build:
      dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile.webapp-dev
      context: .
    working_dir: /work
We can add something like hash or checksum or you name it.
webapp:
    image: webapp-dev
    build:
      dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile.webapp-dev
      checksum:
      - ./package.json
      - ./package-lock.json
      - ./docker/Dockerfile.webapp-dev
      context: .
    working_dir: /work
And now when one of these files in checksum changes, docker-compose up webapp will automatically rebuild an image.
This requires a place where docker-compose can store checksums for images and check those against newly calculated ones.
Also, it is a good idea, IMHO, to new command called checksum which calculates and prints the same checksum as it will be used to make the decision to rebuild an image
