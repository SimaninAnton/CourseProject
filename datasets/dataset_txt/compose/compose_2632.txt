There's an increasing amount of functionality in Compose relating to "environment variables" in different contexts:
Environment variables on the host used to configure Compose's behaviour (e.g. COMPOSE_FILE)
Environment variables on the host used to parameterise configuration values in the Compose file (e.g. "${VAR}")
Environment variables on the host passed through to containers using no-value entries in the environment key (e.g. environment: ["VAR"])
Environment variables created by links in v1 files (e.g. DB_PORT)
And now we're going to start letting you put any of 1-3 in a .env file (#3057).
Maybe there should be a single page in the docs which explains the differences between all of these features and describes (or links off to the right page/section for) the semantics for each.
