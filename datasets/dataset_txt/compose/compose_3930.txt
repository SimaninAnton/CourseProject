I use upstart and fig up to keep a bundle of containers running. If the any container exits, fig would exit and upstart would restart it. This works fine most of time. But occasionally (once per several day) fig would get stuck and do not exit.
I noticed the following exception at the end of the log when it stucked:
Exception in thread Thread-1:

afaick, if container.wait() throws, fig just crashes the thread and leaves the multiplexer waiting on the queue forever. And fig won't exit if there are containers that are still doing fine.
It seems the log printer should send insert STOP to the queue when there is any uncaught exception thrown in the thread.
