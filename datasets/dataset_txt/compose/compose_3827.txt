I can start my container in two ways:
Using console commands (bash script)
Using docker-compose util
Before each start I remove all containers and remove all images
In first case I made
docker build -t web-image .
docker run --restart=always -d -v $(pwd)/www:/app -p 82:80 web-image
Container working as expected. In folder /app I have my mounted project files
In second case I have docker-compose.yml config file
web:
  build: .  
  volumes:
    - www:/app
  ports:
    - "82:80"
  restart: always
docker-compose up -d 
In this case container folder /app is empty
