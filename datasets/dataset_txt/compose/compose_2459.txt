If I try to run a docker-compose exec command it always gives me this error:
D:\Path\> docker-compose exec some-container some-command
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 57, in main
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 108, in perform_command
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 347, in exec_command
NameError: global name 'ExecOperation' is not defined
docker-compose returned -1
Is there a known bug on this message? My guess is that this has something to do with this message Interactive mode is not yet supported on Windows. when you use docker-compose run but I'm not sure..
Thanks for any help in advance!
