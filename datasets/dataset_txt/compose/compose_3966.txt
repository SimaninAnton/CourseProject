fig up should build but I noticed it does some kind of build only in some cases, not sure when. So in practice as said for #734 on has to:
$ fig build
$ fig up -d
but why not just run then fig restart (which should do a fig start and stop if there is any existing). fig start is actually lot faster than fig up -d.
