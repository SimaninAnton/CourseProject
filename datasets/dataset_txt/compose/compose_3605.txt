When following this example:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/
I consistently get the below error:
╰─➤  docker-compose up

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not utterable
I've tried python 3.4.3 & 2.7.10 via pyenv on my MBP
I've installed docker-compose via 'brew cask install' and the 'curl' method shown on docker-compose installation instructions.
here is a dump of my files:

I have no more ideas on what I'm doing wrong. Thanks for any help.
