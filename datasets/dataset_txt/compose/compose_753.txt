Description of the issue
docker-compose build aborts when there is an external volume declared.
Context information (for bug reports)
docker-compose version 1.20.1, build 5d8c71b
Docker version 18.03.0-ce, build 0520e24
Steps to reproduce the issue
Make sure to have an external volume such as
volumes:
  foo:
    external: true
    driver: rancher-nfs
in docker-compose.yml.
and run
docker-compose build
Observed result
I end up:
ERROR: Volume foo declared as external but specifies additional attributes (driver).
Expected result
The build should work, the external nature of the volume should not matter.
