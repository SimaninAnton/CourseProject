I am evaluating docker-compose for my development team and I set up a docker VM on Azure. For firewall restrictions, I configured the VM instance to forward public port 21 to the docker daemon.
I set up the environment variables as follows:
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://myhostonazure.cloudapp.net:21
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/myusernameonmac/.docker
I can use docker without any issue. When I try to use docker-compose build in the same shell, I always receive the following error:
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `boot2docker up`.
Bu I don't want to use boot2docker, and the docker daemon is configured correctly on the remote machine. I am using the docker-compose binaries (downloadable with pip) for mac.
If I just change the port from 21 to 2375 (with a SSH tunnel) everything works fine. How can I get rid of this issue ?
