my compose file looks like this:
  version: '2'
  services:
      ms1:
         expose:
              - "13010"
          networks:
              services:
                  aliases:
                      - ms1
      ms2:
          expose:
              - "13010"
          networks:
              services:
                  aliases:
                      - ms2
  networks:
      services:
when I try to resolve i.e. ms1 host inside ms2 container, it seems that dns waits for my internet DNS, so in the best case it is slow due to ping, and if I'm not connected to inernet it hangs.
If I try to "dig ms1", the response is instantaneous. However, using host it hangs:
[user@816feca682ad ~]$ host ms1
ms1 has address 172.18.0.3
Host ms1 not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
Host ms1 not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
Am I doing something wrong? is there a way to ignore internet resolution for network aliases?
