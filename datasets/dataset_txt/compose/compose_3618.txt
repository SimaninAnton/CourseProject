requirements.txt on 1.2.0 git tag:
docker-py==1.0.0
setup.py on 1.2.0 git tag:
'docker-py >= 1.0.0, < 1.2',
when installing using pip (version source is setup.py):
$ pip install docker-compose==1.2.0
$ pip freeze
docker-compose==1.2.0
docker-py==1.1.0
...
while binary build comes with docker-py==1.0.0 bundled (version source is requirements*.txt)
(conclusion based on missing private registry authentication)
Can you cut a new docker-compose patch release to synchronize the binary and pip install?
Might be also worth to update the binary build script not to rely on requirements.txt but on pip install .
