When building windows containers a compose file like:
foo:
    image: windowsservercore
    volumes:
        - C:\foo:C:\bar:ro
Results in the error:
ERROR: Volume c:\foo:c:\bar:ro has incorrect format, should be external:internal[:mode]
But if I call docker directly with "docker run -v C:\foo:C:\bar:ro windowsservercore" it is accepted as expected.
