We use a webservice setup with docker-compose for running a webserver with a php backend.
Example stub
version: "2"

services:
    db:
        image: mysql
    redis:
        image: redis
    php:
        image: php
        links:
            - db
            - redis
    web:
        image: nginx
        links:
            - php
$ docker-compose up
Creating project_db_1 ... 
Creating project_redis_1 ... Done
Creating project_php_1 ... 
Creating project_web_1 ... Done
This works as expected and the service is up and running.
We also want to run a application cronjob we run a seperate php container with the correct command.
$ docker-compose run php php path/to/cron.php
Starting project_db_1... Done
Starting project_redis_1... Done
# Example Output Application!
The Starting messages are overhead because the containers are already running and re-used for the cron run container.
Several versions ago this was the default behavior, don't know what changed, but since a few versions these overhead messages are shown which is very annoying :-)
