$ docker -v
Docker version 18.05.0-ce, build f150324
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471
I want to silence the output of docker-compose build just like there is a --quiet command in docker if so, please display the full command required to get quiet builds.
I guess one could just redirect standard out, but I'd rather not do this.
Many thanks,
