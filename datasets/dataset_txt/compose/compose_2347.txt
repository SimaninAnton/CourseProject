What I do:
I have the following docker-compose.yml file:
www:
  image: nginx
  ports:
  - 80:80
I cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.override.yml. Then, I try to docker-compose up.
What I expect:
The www service is started and bound to port 80.
What I see instead:
Creating overrides_www_1

ERROR: for www  driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint overrides_www_1 (90938cb33f7d7ae618e9cd143a5aa8085ba9e2392b3e7a4faf2e83c3feac85a5): Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated

If I run docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up or docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml up, it works.
If I run docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml up (yup, twice!) I get the same error.
Why oh why am I even trying to do that:
I have a Compose file with build statements, and I'm overriding it with a new Compose file with image statements. I keep every other parameter as-is (and end up with the port mapping issue).
