Hello Dear Support!
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
My problem is that compose only supports TCP and UDP port protocol types when exposing services ports, although it was already [implemented]
(moby/moby#9689 (comment)) in docker since 18.03.
And explained here
You can also bind UDP and SCTP (typically used by telecom protocols such as SIGTRAN, Diameter, and S1AP/X2AP) ports by adding a trailing /udp or /sctp. For example:

$ docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:5000/udp training/webapp python app.py
Trying to run the following:
$ docker-compose run -p 3868:3868/sctp diameter
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: Invalid port "3868:3868/sctp", should be [[remote_ip:]remote_port[-remote_port]:]port[/protocol]
[35556] Failed to execute script docker-compose
The same with TCP is success:
golan@ppcc-cgr-ptk-node-01:~/cgrates_docker$ docker-compose run -p 3868:3868/tcp diameter
2018/11/11 06:02:49 <c60f53b> [INFO] Starting Diameter service  OK
I was wandering if you are planning to align compose acceptable values to respect expose port using SCTP protocol and convert to correct docker commands.
If I understand correctly, that concludes only extending the list of allowed values (tcp,udp,sctp)
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like docker-compose to respect sctp as it is an industry standard and widely used in telco's environments.
The example docker-compose.yml could look like:
version: "3.x"
services:
  diameter:
      image: diameter
      container_name: diameter
      ports:
          - "3868:3868/sctp"
Describe alternatives you've considered
I've considered running docker manually with -p flag.
For example ... -p 3868:3868/sctp
