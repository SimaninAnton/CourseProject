I have following docker-compose:
  db:
    image: mariadb
    environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mysecretpass
    restart: always
I can backup my databases using this command:
cd /opt/docker_data/ && /usr/local/bin/docker-compose exec db sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"' > /opt/backup.sql
This works fine.
I added the same line of code to my crontable, but then I get to following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/docker-compose", line 6, in <module>
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 71, in main

ValueError: file descriptor cannot be a negative integer (-1)
Failed to execute script docker-compose
What is my mistake?
Thank you!
