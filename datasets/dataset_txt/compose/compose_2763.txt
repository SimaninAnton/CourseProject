Even though the latest release mentions depends_on (documented here):
There's a new depends_on option for specifying dependencies between services.
I can't get it to work:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
Unsupported config option for web: 'depends_on'
Here's the relevant section of my docker-compose.yml:
web:
  build: .
  ports:
    - "8010:5000"
  links:
    - db
  depends_on:
    - db-ready
