As it turns out, when you got two or more projects that want to communicate with each other, docker-compose support is lacking. Starting up project_a requires me to have project_b running and vice versa.
# project_a/docker-compose.yml
app:
  external_links: projectb_app:b
# project_b/docker-compose.yml
app:
  external_links: projecta_app:a
For now I can circumvent this by running an ambassador proxy but it makes me wonder if this is something that should be solved by tooling in docker-compose. I'd love to hear your ideas.
Currently this increases developer sadness quota by 42%
