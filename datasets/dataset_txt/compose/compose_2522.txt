I have a project with containers already created but stopped. When I do up --build, it just starts the containers and doesn't recreate them:
$ docker-compose up --build
Building web
...
Removing intermediate container d2dbcf581064
Successfully built ebe1c55658cd
Starting charingcross_db_1
Starting charingcross_web_1
...
Running a second time builds twice, but recreates it successfully:
$ docker-compose up -d
Building web
...
Removing intermediate container 47aa1ff5fd24
Successfully built 2f73f4815ea1
Starting charingcross_db_1
Recreating charingcross_web_1
Building web
...
Successfully built 2f73f4815ea1
Attaching to charingcross_db_1, charingcross_web_1
