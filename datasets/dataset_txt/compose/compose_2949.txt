I copied docker.exe from a machine where I installed Docker tools. I copied my certs and I set Docker_Host, Docker_Cert_Path and Docker_Tls_verify and I can run my Docker commands no issue.
I downloaded version 1.5.2 from https://github.com/docker/compose/releases of docker-compose-windows-x86_64.exe of Docker-compose and when I run any docker-compose commands that connect to my daemon I get the following error.
ERROR: SSL error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:590)

I have read through issue 890. I really need a xcopy solution. I am building a Visual Studio Team Services custom build task that must be able to simply copy Docker-compose.exe to a hosted agent machine with the certs and execute commands. This method works fine with Docker.exe and I need Docker-Compose.exe to work the same way.
