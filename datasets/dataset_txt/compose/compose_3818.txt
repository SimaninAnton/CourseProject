Hi,
I was trying to pull some images from a private repository with a problem in .dockercfg and besides it was failing pull command always returns 0 and gives no feedback.
Normal output:
Pulling someservice (company/someservice:latest)...
Output using --verbose
Pulling someservice (company/someservice:latest)...
docker pull <- (u'company/someservice:latest', insecure_registry=False)
docker pull -> u'{"status":"Pulling repository company/someservice"}\r\n{"errorDetail":{"message":"Error: image company/someservice:latest not found"},"error":"Error: image company/someservice:latest not found"}\r\n'
