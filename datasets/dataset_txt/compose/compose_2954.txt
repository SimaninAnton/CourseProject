I have following simple services:
srv_0:
  image: busybox
  command: sleep 300
  links:
    - srv_1

srv_1:
  image: busybox
  command: sleep 300
They are successfully started with up command:
docker-compose up srv_0
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                   NAMES
3f553caaedfb        busybox                       "sleep 300"              18 seconds ago      Up 17 seconds                                                               dockercompose_srv_0_1
45bf185cc27f        busybox                       "sleep 300"              31 minutes ago      Up 18 seconds                                                               dockercompose_srv_1_1
Now srv_1 is deprecated and I replace it with srv_2:
srv_0:
  image: busybox
  command: sleep 300
  links:
    - srv_2

srv_2:
  image: busybox
  command: sleep 350
docker-compose up srv_0
still works successfully, but it leaves orphaned srv_1:
