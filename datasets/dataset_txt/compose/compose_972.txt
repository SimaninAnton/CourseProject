Version: docker-compose version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb
Platform: Windows
@damtur discovered an issue where docker-compose.exe build throws a cryptic error when there is a blank line (a single space) in the .dockerignore file. It seems to be a windows specific problem. Removing the line, or just the space character fixes it.
Stack trace:
PS E:\src\repro> docker-compose up -d --build

Reproducing:
Add the following files to a new directory and run docker-compose.exe build
dockercompose.yml
version: '3.2'

services:
  frontend-watch:
    image: frontend-build 
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
.dockerignore
[ This just needs to be any line with just spaces on it - whether it is interspersed with other lines makes no difference ]
