I have been running docker commands on remote host (swarm cluster in cloud) using host parameter as shown below.
docker -H 10.10.10.10:2375 version
Similarly, docker-compose also has -H parameter, as mentioned here
I am running docker-compose version 1.6.2, which throws error when -H parameter is provided. It seems that host parameter is not supported in this version.
How can I can point docker-compose to remote host on this machine.
