Often you find that there are setting that can be derived from the ENV vs hardcoded in the yml file especially in development. I am working on the containers for test and deployment of an open source project and I realized if I could set things in the yml file such as VARIABLE=docker-machine ip sonar or VARIABLE2=docker-machine ip machine2 or UID=id|cut -c5-7 could be very powerful to make yml lets static/env dependent (I saw another ticket about UID a few minutes ago). If we took this approach it would solve alot env issues...
