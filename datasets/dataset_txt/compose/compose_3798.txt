Hi,
Do you plan to add deployment/releases functionality to the docker-compose?
I mean:
Deploying a new version of the service or services specified in the configuration
Rolling back to a previous release
If not, could you please recommend a tool for that kind of tasks for small projects without clustering, private registry, and orchestration?
