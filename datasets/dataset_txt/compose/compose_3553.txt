This is related to #1045. After hitting the issue mentioned in #1045, subsequent docker-compose up fails with:
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
Recreating foo_bar_1...
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. (read timeout=60)
$ sudo DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=300 docker-compose up
Recreating foo_bar_1...
Recreating 9c1b31a841_foo_bar_1...
Conflict. The name "foo_bar_1" is already in use by container 4af37fe03b76. You have to delete (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
