I have this Dockerfile
mrb:
  build: .
  environment:
    - affinity:container!=/mrb/
I run this against as swarm. The container should spread across nodes and should be built - not a common use-case, I know. But I tried to overcome issues with host-volumes.
I was able to get two containers up and running, but nonetheless building on a swarm and scale should at least trigger a warning, since you can't really ensure that all nodes have the same version of a built image.
