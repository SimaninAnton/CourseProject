I have spent the past few day working on creating a docker swarm on Digtital Ocean.
I am using one server as a kv-store server running console according to this guide. Becasue i'm on Digital Ocean, i'm using private networking on DO so the machines can communicate with each other.
I then create a hive master and slave, and start the overlay network, which is running on all machines. Here is my docker-compose.yml
proxy:
    image: tutum/haproxy 
    ports:
        - "1936:1936"
        - "80:80"

web:
    image: tutum/hello-world
    expose:
        - "80"
So when I do this it creates the 2 containers. HAProxy is running because I can access the stats at port 1936 at http://<ip-address>:1936, however, when I try to go to the web server/load balancer at port 80 I get connection refused. I everything seems to be connected though, when I run docker-compose ps:
       Name                      Command               State                                 Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
splashcloud_proxy_1   python /haproxy/main.py          Up      104.236.109.58:1936->1936/tcp, 443/tcp, 104.236.109.58:80->80/tcp
splashcloud_web_1     /bin/sh -c php-fpm -d vari ...   Up      80/tcp
The only thing I can think of is that it's not linking to the web container, but i'm not sure how to troubleshoot this.
I'd appreciate any help on this.
