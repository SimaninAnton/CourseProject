I created an base image with instructions like:
ONBUILD RUN /app/init --env=Dotenv --overwrite=n
I was expecting to see fig running these commands, when using the image, since they should be executed the next time the image is build. But fig just says: frontend uses an image, skipping and I have to issue the commands manually with fig.
Am I missing something or is this a current limitation?
