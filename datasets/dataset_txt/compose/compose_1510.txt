I have a few setup scripts that output information like so:
Setting up this thingy... done.
Setting up that thingy... OK.
Finalizing... ERROR! Everything is bad.
Some of these steps can take a long time, but because docker-compose seems to buffer lines when calling docker-compose logs -f I only see the previous statement, and not what's currently happening because the line isn't finished.
What I want to see:
Setting up things... done.
Setting up more things...
What I see:
Setting up things... done.
<nothing here until the 'done' pops in and finishes the line>
This would be more functional, and also less unexpected as it would follow the behavior of tail -f which many programmers are familiar with.
