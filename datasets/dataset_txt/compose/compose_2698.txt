Issue
It appears that the network_mode option only works when only one compose file is used, with no concatenation or extension. (Or perhaps the compose documentation is unclear on correct usage).
Setup
docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    network_mode: "bridge"
  app:
    image: registry/app:latest
    env_file: .env
    network_mode: "bridge"
dc-mapped.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  redis:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: redis
  app:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: app
    volumes:
      - .:/opt/app
    links:
      - redis
    depends_on: 
      - redis
Run with the extending compose file
$ docker-compose -f dc-mapped.yml up
...
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "f31553121a0f685f2aff35a5831ee884d932ee2293b6dc87fdbb9f8f1db976a8",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        ....
        "Containers": {},
        ....
    }
]
But, run with the main compose file
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
...
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "f31553121a0f685f2aff35a5831ee884d932ee2293b6dc87fdbb9f8f1db976a8",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        ....
        "Containers": {
            "7ab09300580c7d0b8c4250fbeaa1c666f14a41db4565b360630de29a9224832b": {
                "Name": "myapp_app_1",
                "EndpointID": "17eeddf3a6cfa9e556bfbd0eebd53613acc92658f6461a6af73a70ebd56d2fb6",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            },
            "dfa3ffeafd828537e0c8e9448a9cb94f582e9c30a382a90fa9c995f557580026": {
                "Name": myapp_redis_1",
                "EndpointID": "4773093e5e73d13ccd234ba46cf64ad9bc91ccfac7a0f2d5ef7fbcad283f03ec",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:03",
                "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.3/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        ....
    }
]
Further tests
specifying network_mode in the extending compose file has no effect (containers do not attach to bridge network)
same as above, but also removing network_mode from master compose file has no effect
removing extends and passing both files to docker-compose (whether either or both of the files contains network_mode) has no effect
