I have a data container build from scratch with nothing but a file called /true init, so that fig is able to start up the container (it would be nice if I didn't even need that file). Fig starts the container fine the first time, but attempting to run fig up on the service after bringing it down results in an odd message:
Cannot start container 12341234...: exec: "/bin/echo": stat /bin/echo: no such file or directory
I don't want fig runing echo - I want to run /true, if anything.
FROM scratch

COPY true /true

CMD [ "/true" ]
Shouldn't fig respect CMD? Can I make it respect CMD?
