Example:
PWD is interpolated when I'm using environment
# docker-compose
  tests_runner:
    environment:
      STORAGE_DIR: ${PWD}/storage-tmp
      UPLOADS_DIR: ${PWD}/public/uploads-tmp
      CARRIERWAVE_CACHE_DIR: ${PWD}/tmp/uploads-tmp
I expect that it would interpolate variables when I'm using env_file too
# docker-compose
  tests_runner:
    env_file:
      - ./some.env

# some.env
STORAGE_DIR=${PWD}/storage-tmp
UPLOADS_DIR=${PWD}/public/uploads-tmp
CARRIERWAVE_CACHE_DIR=${PWD}/tmp/uploads-tmp
