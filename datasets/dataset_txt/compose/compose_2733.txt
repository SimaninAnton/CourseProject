My docker setup involves everything in its own container which has an nginx container sitting in front of it and reverse proxying to a database container running postgres, an api container running node, 2 frontend containers.
The problem im having is that i am not able to run the tests on my API as it depends on the host name being correct but it cannot connect to that hostname within itself in the container.
Would i need to set up a link from the api container to the nginx container. (I already have a link from the nginx container to the api container). and if so how would i do this in a way that i can still use the right host in my config file for the tests
