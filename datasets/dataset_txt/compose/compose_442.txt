Hi,
The "extends" is not supported or not available in the schema of version 3, the possibility of a multiple call (-f compose1.yml -f compose2.yml ..) not correspond to the need because I dont want to extend a service or create/deploy another service.
Is it possible to add global or default specification definitions for all services to factorize this?
Example "combined" format :
services_global_spec:
  deploy:
    replicas: 1
    update_config:
      parallelism: 1
      delay: 30s
  logging:
    driver: syslog
    options: 
      syslog-address: "tcp://logs.domain.tdl"
      tag: '{{.Name}}'

services:
  myservice1:
    image: hub/image:tag

  myservice2:
    image: hub/image2:tag
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

  myservice3:
    image: hub/image:tag
    deploy:
      replicas: 6
      update_config:
        parallelism: 2
    logging:
      options: 
        tag: 'override_myservice1'
PS: I think of the ability to define the defaults values of services in the docker configuration (daemon.json) is ideal.. What do you think?
Thx,
Best regard,
