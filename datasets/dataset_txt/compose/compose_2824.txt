I have the following files:
docker-compose.yml
version: "2"
services:
  some-service:
    image: busybox
    command: "sleep 120000"
    networks:
      - some-tier

networks:
  some-tier:
docker-compose.override.yml
version: "2"
services:
  some-service:
    environment:
      FOO: bar
When running Compose I experience the following
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
$ docker-compose up -d
WARNING: Some networks were defined but are not used by any service: some-tier
Creating developer_some-service_1
$ docker inspect -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}" developer_some-service_1
{"developer_default":{...}}
I would've expected that the network some-tier would be used by some-service. Is my expectation wrong?
