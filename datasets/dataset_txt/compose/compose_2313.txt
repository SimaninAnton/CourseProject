Hello,
I would like to be able to use env-var in my docker-compose.yml files in order to use my services in differents instances .
Example :
services:
  elasticsearch:
    volumes:
      - ${MACHINE_PREFIX}-elastic:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
    networks:
      - net
      - ${MACHINE_MASTER_NAME}1/consul_default

networks:
  net:
    driver: overlay
  ${MACHINE_MASTER_NAME}1/consul_default:
    external: true

volumes:
  ${MACHINE_PREFIX}-elastic:
    external: true
The var is replaced in the service section, but in networks and volumes section it is not.
Would it be possible to add this feature ?
