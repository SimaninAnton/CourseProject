/data directory preserved in container after recreate
docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
     image: zookeeper:3.4.11
     container_name: zookeeper
     environment:
#       ZOO_DATA_DIR: /usr/local/lib
       ZOO_MY_ID: 1
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "zookeeper_default" with the default driver
Creating zookeeper ... done
$ docker exec zookeeper cat /data/myid
1
now change ZOO_MY_ID: 2
$ docker-compose up -d
Recreating zookeeper ... done
$ docker exec zookeeper cat /data/myid
1
this should have been changed to 2 as per the entry-point.sh of that container, but it stays 1

If I change ZOO_DATA_DIR to /usr/local/lib all works as expected /usr/local/lib/myid is changed to 2
seems like somehow compose recreate is keeping contents of /data directory
is this expected?
