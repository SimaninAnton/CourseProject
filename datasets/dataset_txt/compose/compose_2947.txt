The minimal docker-compose.yml file:
test:
  image: busybox
  dns: 127.0.0.1
Fails to start when I do docker-compose up with ERROR: compose.cli.main.main: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type []string (Full verbose logs are here)
Changing the file to:
test:
  image: busybox
  dns: 
    - 127.0.0.1
Causes the container to start up correctly.
Note I'm using docker-machine to talk to a physical ubuntu host. Output from my machine:
Docker compose version: docker-compose version 1.5.2, build 7240ff3
Docker version: Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5
Os: OSX 10.10.5
And from the ubuntu host:
Docker version:
Client:
 Version:      1.9.1
 API version:  1.21
 Go version:   go1.4.2
 Git commit:   a34a1d5

 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64

Server:
 Version:      1.9.1
 API version:  1.21
 Go version:   go1.4.2
 Git commit:   a34a1d5
 Built:        Fri Nov 20 13:16:54 UTC 2015
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
Os: Ubuntu 15.04
Rampant speculation starts here:
Guessing that the parameters required by the docker api became more restrictive, or that the way docker-compose passes them inadvertently changed.
