From #2477
If we remove links for networking, run will no longer start any "dependent" services. Some users were depending on this functionality to be able to do things with a single run command.
From #2474
When we changed the default behaviour of up to not exit until all containers have exited, it broke the workflow for some users.
To support these kinds of workflows, we might be able to do something like this:
Add an --up flag to run. This flag would tell Compose to start all services in the project before running the one-off container.
Combined with proposed docker-compose down (#2277) this would allow users to run a testing workflow with only two commands, instead of 4 or 5.
