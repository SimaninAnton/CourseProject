Probably I found some misbehavior with named volumes & chmod 777
Imagine scenario where we have 2 containers sharing the same named volume (cache-volume) and having the same mount point for it /opt/cache
version "3"
services:
  container1:
  volumes:
      - cache-volume:/opt/cache

  container2:
  volumes:
      - cache-volume:/opt/cache

volumes:
  cache-volume:
Imagine that both container1's and container2's images are extending some common baseimage. If inside Dockerfile for baseimage we put a statement
RUN mkdir /opt/cache && chmod 777 /opt/cache
that won't work - the /opt/cache inside container1 & container2 will be mounted as root and rwxr-xr-x
Only if we declare the above statement inside both container1's & container2's Dockerfiles it behaves correctly & resulting volume will get rwxrwxrwx permissions.
Hope I was clear enough in describing the scenario.
