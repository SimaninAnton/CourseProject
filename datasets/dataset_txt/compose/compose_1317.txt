The problem
Volume is empty after the container is brought up from the "restart:always" setting. It is not empty when started manually.
Environment
Windows 10 Build 15063.
Docker for Windows.
Docker version 17.06.0-ce.
Docker compose version 1.14.0, build c7bdf9e
Reproduction
First, I create the directory F:\test with a folder named "folder" and a file named "file.txt".
Using the following compose file:
version: '3'
services:
  test-service:
    container_name: test-container
    image: nginx:1.13
    volumes:
      - F:\test:/test
    restart: always
I bring it up with docker-compose up. In another console I count the number of files on the volume:
λ docker-compose exec test-service ls /test -1 | wc -l     
2
Which is expected and working properly. Then I gracefully stop the container and restart the computer.
λ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
bab6e5aab15e        nginx:1.13              "nginx -g 'daemon ..."   5 minutes ago       Up About a minute   80/tcp           test-container
The container restarted with docker as expected, but then I again count the files in the volume:
λ docker-compose exec test-service ls /test -1 | wc -l     
0
The volume is empty after the restart! Restarting the container with docker-compose restart, fixes the problem, and the 2 results show up as expected, but then having restart:always is pointless if I have to manually restart everytime.
I used nginx as image because it's a easy example, but it also happens with python:3.
Is this some expected behavior that I'm overlooking?
