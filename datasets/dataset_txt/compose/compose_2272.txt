At https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/ , in section "Routed network environment", there is a diagram that is supposed to be just similar to the diagram in the previous "Switched network environment" section, but it is actually almost identical. The switch diagram refers to a "Level 2 Switch", and the router diagram refers to a "Layer 2 Switch" (notice the subtle wording difference).
I'm not sure if the implications of using a router vs. a switch should indicate other differences in the diagrams. I would think so.
