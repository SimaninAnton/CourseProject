I am trying to use vSphere Docker Volume Service with "docker stack deploy" command to deploy a stack with the following compose file.
version: '3'

services:
   db:
     image: mariadb
     deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == worker
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpasswd
       MYSQL_USER: wp
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wppasswd
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wp
     volumes:
       - mariadb@sharedVmfs-0:/var/lib/mysql

   web:
     image: wordpress:latest
     deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
     depends_on:
       - db
     ports:
       - "8080:80"
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wp
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wppasswd
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wp

volumes:
   mariadb@sharedVmfs-0:
     driver: vsphere
     driver_opts:
       size: 1Gb
       diskformat: zeroedthick
                                                            
In that compose file, the volume is created by vSphere Docker Volume Service, and has the format like vol_name@datastore (mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 in the compose file). But I got the following error:
root@sc-rdops-vm02-dhcp-52-237:~# docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-vsphere.yml wordpress
mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 Additional property mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 is not allowed
It looks to me that volume name including special characters like "@" cannot be used in the compose file.
I know one of the workaround is to pre-create the volume mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 , and then mark the volume as "external" in the compose file like this:
volumes:
   mariadb:
     external:
        name:  mariadb@sharedVmfs-0
It seems that most docker API can support volume name with special characters for volumes created by volume plugin, for example, I can create the volume mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 - using the volume plugin:
root@sc-rdops-vm02-dhcp-52-237:~# docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=mariadb@sharedVmfs-0 -o size=1gb
mariadb@sharedVmfs-0
root@sc-rdops-vm02-dhcp-52-237:~# 
root@sc-rdops-vm02-dhcp-52-237:~# 
root@sc-rdops-vm02-dhcp-52-237:~# docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
vsphere:latest      mariadb@sharedVmfs-0
So this seems a bug for docker compose.
