Got something weird with compose; containers are created, but docker inspect does not show IP-address information of them. Very simple docker-compose.yml;
version: 2
services:
  server-a:
    image: nginx

  server-b:
    image: nginx
After running docker-compose up -d, containers are created, and attached to a network for the project, but a docker inspect does not show IP-address information;

                        "server-a"
                    ],

                    "EndpointID": "",
                    "Gateway": "",
                    "IPAddress": "",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 0,
                    "IPv6Gateway": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
                    "MacAddress": ""
                }
            }
        }
Containers are in fact having an IP-address assigned, and function correctly.
Not sure if this is a bug in docker-compose or engine
