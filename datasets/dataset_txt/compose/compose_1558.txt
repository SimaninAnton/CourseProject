Hi
I am trying to dockerize an application and facing some issues with the DNS entries and docker network setup. The application itself is a simple webapp that talks to a MySQL db. The only thing is we use certain specific DNS hosts entries to route some requests. On a "non-docker" environment, we do this by manually adding entries to /etc/hosts. I have tried different options to achieve the same result in a dockerized environment. As a last attempt, i tried to run a DNS server on a separate container. I added the specific DNS hosts entries using the DNS server web admin console.
However i cannot get the app container to talk to the DNS container. I am not sure if i need to set up a custom network. Here's the docker-compose file that i am using
version: '3'
services:
   db:
    build: authdb
    environment:  
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    image:  authdb_docker_host
    ports:     
      - "3306:3306"
   app:
    build:
      context:  ./platform    
    ports:  
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - bind
    command: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh", "db:3306","-s","-t","0","--","catalina.sh", "run"]
    links:
      - "db:authdb_docker_host"
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1:53

#DNS Server
   bind:
    image: sameersbn/bind:latest
#Tried with various entries like 127.0.0.1. This is the IP assigned to the bind container
    dns: 172.18.0.2
    environment:
      - ROOT_PASSWORD=SecretPassword
    ports:
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "10000:10000/tcp"
    volumes:
      - /tmp/:/data
