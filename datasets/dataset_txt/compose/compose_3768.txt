What is the purpose of the switch -v with "docker-compose rm"?
I thought it would delete the volume associated with the container but it is not doing so. In my configuration, I have one container with volume mapping (hostPath:containerPath).
If I use "docker-compose rm -v --force <<service_name>>", will it delete the volume along with the container?
