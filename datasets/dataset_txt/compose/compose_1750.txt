I have a log file inside a container
$ sudo docker-compose exec syslog ls -lh /var/log/messages           
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       80.8M Jan 26 18:49 /var/log/messages
its about 600k lines
$ sudo docker-compose exec syslog wc -l /var/log/messages
639629 /var/log/messages
The following command works:
sudo docker-compose exec syslog cat /var/log/messages
Also the following (there are few results for this command):
sudo docker-compose exec syslog cat /var/log/messages | grep "asdfasdf"
But greping for http (almost all the lines), crash after printing a few hundred lines
sudo docker-compose exec syslog cat /var/log/messages | grep "http"
Traceback (most recent call last):.1 <redacted. just a random line from messages file>
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>

OSError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
docker-compose returned -1
I can reproduce the bug everytime.
Yes, I can avoid the bug using grep http messages instead of the useless use of cat. But this is just for the sake of reporting the bug.
Seems related to #1509 #3352
