I'll have docker up and running with docker-compose up
All is fine. Then after about a minute, I see this
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run docker-machine start default.
Running dockker-machine ls shows
NAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS

I can run docker-compose up again and it works for about another minute. Then connection drops.
docker -v
Docker version 1.10.2, build c3959b1
docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
