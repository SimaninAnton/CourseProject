I've been doing some experimenting with restarts and have come across some strange behaviour.
Say I have the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
  testA:
    image: ubuntu:16.04
    restart: always
    command: bash  -c "exit 1"

  testB:
    image: ubuntu:16.04
    restart: always
    command: bash
If I call docker-compose run testA it runs, crashes, then restarts as expected:
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                                  PORTS               NAMES
1fcd3c128245        ubuntu:16.04        "bash -c 'exit 1'"       12 seconds ago      Restarting (1) Less than a second ago                       restarttest_testA_run_1
If I call docker-compose run testB, and then call exit 1, it says exit, and then hangs, without going back to the normal terminal.
root@19972505e027:/# exit 1
exit
In a seperate terminal:
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
19972505e027        ubuntu:16.04        "bash"                   19 seconds ago      Up 6 seconds                                        restarttest_testB_run_3
It appears as if it's restarted, in fact I can exec into the container (docker exec -it $(docker ps -lq) bash) and fiddle around a bit. However when I go back to the original container and ctrl+c, it closes, goes back to terminal, and kills the container.
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS               NAMES
I understand that I should be running this kind of scenario with up instead of run but I was experimenting with something that required a bit of interactivity and I'm more curious than anything right now.
I'm wondering what's happening between me exiting the container and the container shutting down, and what I'm actually doing by pressing ctrl+c?
