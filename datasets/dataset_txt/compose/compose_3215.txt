We can use below command and the context of container is current dir:
docker -f ../path/Dockerfile
How to do it In compose?
my project
docker
├── README.md
├── mongo
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── docker-entrypoint.sh
└── node
    └── Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose
web:
  restart: always
  build: docker/node
  links:
    - mongo
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
    - "9001:9001"
    - "3001:3001"
  volumes:
    - .:/src
  environment:
docker/node/Dockerfile
FROM mhart/alpine-node

WORKDIR /src
# project root
ADD . .
I want add the project source codes to web container, but it was failed.
