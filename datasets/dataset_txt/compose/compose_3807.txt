Problem
On Quick Start section under Create a Docker image, the Dockerfile copies over the current directory into the image and the Docker-compose.yml file mounts the current directory inside of the container, both actions result in code being under /code directory. For beginners this example makes more complicated to understand how the data got there.
Solution
Break up the example into two parts, explicitly showing how to both actions end up having the /code files inside of the running container.
