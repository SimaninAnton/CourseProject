I used the docker compose version 1.11 and after upgrading to 1.13.0 I had problems.
docker-compose --version docker-compose version 1.13.0, build 1719ceb
Docker-compose file is version '2.1'.
The new version exits with an error:
Starting consul0 ... error
ERROR: for consul0  Cannot create container for service consul0: invalid port specification: "None"
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
The port specification of consul0 is:
    ports:
      - "8500:8500"
Similar problems with all containers, for example with nginx0:
nginx0:
   image: nginx:alpine
   container_name: nginx0
   hostname: nginx0
   domainname: xxx.yyy.zzz
   networks:
     internal_network:
       aliases:
         - nginx0.xxx.yyy.zzz
   depends_on:
     - proxy0
   ports:
     - "80:80"
     - "443:443"
As far as I know everything should work. But as you see after the upgrade everything broke.
