Hi, I'm having an issue orchestrating containers. I am unable to remotely access the database service from the web service. It seems that using the web container name for the remote user's host name does not correctly resolve to the appropriate IP.
If I create a mysql user with an explicit IP (eg. 172.18.0.3) as the host name, then the database service allows connections from that user. If I do the same thing but with the container name (eg. web) as the host name, then the database service does not allow connections from that user.
This is the error: [Warning] mysqli::real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'ss_user'@'172.18.0.3' (using password: NO)
Here is my docker-compose.yml:
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: brettt89/silverstripe-web
    container_name: web
    working_dir: /var/www
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html

  database:
    image: mysql
    container_name: database
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    container_name: phpmyadmin
    environment:
      - PMA_HOST=database
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:80
    volumes:
      - /sessions

If it helps, this is a Silverstripe CMS project. The needed db credentials are provided by a .env file:
# Environment
SS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="dev"

# DB credentials
SS_DATABASE_SERVER="database"
SS_DATABASE_USERNAME="ss_user"
SS_DATABASE_PASSWORD=""
SS_DATABASE_NAME="ss_database"
