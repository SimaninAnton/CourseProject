Hi!
If I get the binary from https://github.com/orchardup/fig/releases/download/0.3.2/linux and run on my Arch Linux, I get a few errors on startup:
$ /usr/local/bin/fig --version
sh: symbol lookup error: sh: undefined symbol: rl_signal_event_hook
sh: symbol lookup error: sh: undefined symbol: rl_signal_event_hook
sh: symbol lookup error: sh: undefined symbol: rl_signal_event_hook
sh: symbol lookup error: sh: undefined symbol: rl_signal_event_hook
fig 0.3.2
However, if I install directly from pip, these errors don't appear.
From a bit of googling it seems to me they are related to the readline version... Might be some incompatibility with a bundled library in the binary version.
I haven't had any issues apart from the annoying messages though (console apps work fine).
