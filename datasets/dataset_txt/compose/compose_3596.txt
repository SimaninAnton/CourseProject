Hello,
I am using compose in microservice setup and it would be ideal to have service names such as "service-one", "service_two" etc but apparently that is not allowed and also I didn't see it in the docs...
Example of how I used it currently which shows service names mushed together
contentservicedb:
  image: postgres:latest
contentservice:
  extends:
    file: ../content/docker-compose.yml
    service: web
  links:
    - contentservicedb

usersservicedb:
  image: postgres:latest
usersservice:
  extends:
    file: ../users/docker-compose.yml
    service: web
  links:
    - usersservicedb

gatekeeperservice:
  image: clusterhq/twisted
Just wondering if it will ever be possible to include hyphen or underscore for this use case...
Thanks!
