Let's assume you've these files:
/.env
/docker-compose.yml
/docker-compose.override.yml

/tests/.env
/tests/docker-compose.override.yml
Running docker-compose up from / uses the files on that level, while running it from tests/ takes the .env from tests/ but docker-compose.override.yml from the root directory.
I'd have expected it to use the override file from the current directory, even if docker-compose.yml is not present.
