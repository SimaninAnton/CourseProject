Description of the issue
When calling docker-compose ps, stopped containers created by docker-compose up are listed, but stopped container created by docker-compose run are not.
This is an hindrance to one of our workflows that goes as follow:
docker-compose run a container that creates a file in its filesystem
container_name = docker-compose ps
container_id = docker ps
docker cp container_id:/path/to/the/file file to copy those files on the host machine
