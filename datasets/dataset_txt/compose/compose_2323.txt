Sometimes when tailing my logs using docker-compose logs -f a docker-compose error is dumped in the output. It doesn't stop the log tailing from continuing or anything, but it is confusing.
I am using compose 1.7.1 and docker 1.11.1 and have seen this happen on both Windows and Mac.

Looks like this is triggered when one of the containers forces nginx to reload its configuration using docker kill --signal=HUP nginx.
