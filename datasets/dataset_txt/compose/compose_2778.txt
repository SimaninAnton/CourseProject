Hi everyone,
Im not sure if this is a docker, docker-compose or a "me" bug. But Im not getting my head around this for several hours.
My simple docker-compose.yml
version: "2"
services:
  app:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes_from:
      - storage
  storage:
    image: ubuntu:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/data
I bootstrap it with $ docker-compose up -d.
Now I jump into "app" via docker exec -it docker_app_1 bash and add a test file within my new created volume.
root@8f5f850c30c7:/# touch /var/data/test
root@8f5f850c30c7:/# ls /var/data
test
Seems to work. Shutdown via $ docker-compose stop. Now I add a second volume to my storage container:
version: "2"
services:
  app:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes_from:
      - storage
  storage:
    image: ubuntu:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/data
      - /my/host/folder:/var/data2
This time this volume is backed by a host directory. Rerun:
$ docker-compose up -d
Recreating docker_storage_1
Recreating docker_app_1
Okay so far. Recreated my storage container, but should preserve existing volumes (docs). Lets check this:
$ docker exec -it docker_app_1 bash
root@8f5f850c30c7:/# ls /var/data
Oh my data is gone, but why? This is not the only time my data gots "lost" the last days.
Its not 100% clear when this will happen. Simple running $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate twice kills my data also. After the first launch my data is still there and after the second one its lost. Is this expected behavior? Recreate process seems to be broken in compose 1.6.0 :(
This happens on my local environment (OS X, docker 1.10.0, compose 1.6.0) and on my ubuntu-backed vServer (docker 1.10.1, compose 1.6.0).
Thanks for any advice
System:
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
