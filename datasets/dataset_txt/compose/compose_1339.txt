I'm trying to deploy an IMAP server using docker-compose and secrets for the sensitive data management. I followed the documentation for the long syntax form of creating secrets. But anytime I do docker-compose up -d I get this warning:
WARNING: Service "imap" uses secret "key" with uid, gid, or mode. These fields are not supported by this implementation of the Compose file
WARNING: Service "imap" uses secret "cert" with uid, gid, or mode. These fields are not supported by this implementation of the Compose file
This actually doesn't prevent the containers from being deployed though. But none of the properties set in the docker-compose.yml file are applied to the generated files inside the container.
I have already checked for the compatibility table, but according to it, I should not be getting this warning, since I'm running my containers with the following docker engine and docker-compose versions:
