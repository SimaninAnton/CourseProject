hi,
i had a strange behavior lately regarding docker-compose, at first i though of a mistake i've made, but after digging in, i found that some containers (i haven't found something deterministic) won't start using docker-compose if docker option --iptables=false is set.
a very strange thing is in my case the container involved has no port forwarded, only using linked containers.
digging more i found a exit status 128 regarding the involved container.
any clues maybe ?
