docker-compose run does not seem to honor container_name attribute in Docker Compose file.
Here is the Compose file:
version: '2'

services:
  db:
    image: arungupta/oreilly-couchbase
    container_name: db
    ports:
      - 8091:8091
      - 8092:8092
      - 8093:8093
      - 11210:11210
docker-compose up -d shows the container name with docker ps correctly as db.
But running the container as docker-compose run --service-ports -d db uses the container name as <project>_<service>_run_x. So, for the first run this value is sample_db_run_1. For the second run, this is sample_db_run_2, and so on.
