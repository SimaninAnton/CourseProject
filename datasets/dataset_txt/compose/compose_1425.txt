I've installed the latest version of Docker CE and Compose and them shows as follow:
# docker --version
Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be

# docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.13.0, build 1719ceb
Each time I try to run docker-compose up I end with the following error:
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
I've read and apply everything as in here. This is completely new and just happen to me in this new installation however I am not sure why.
Can I get some help?
