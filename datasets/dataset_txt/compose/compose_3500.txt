Many of Compose's actions can be performed in parallel rather than in sequence. For larger apps, this would result in enormously reduced startup/redeploy times.
This is a meta-issue for keeping track of all of the stuff happening around that, in rough priority order.
docker-compose (stop|kill|remove): #1651
docker-compose scale: #1653
docker-compose up: Creating, pulling, building and starting in up can be done in parallel: #1984
docker-compose pull: Multiple services can be pulled in parallel.
docker-compose pull --parallel is the default (deprecate flag).
(Replaces #1395)
