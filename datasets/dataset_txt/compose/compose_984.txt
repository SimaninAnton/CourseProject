I'm almost 100% confident it is my own stupidity causing this error. However, I would really like to fix this:)
I'm currently using the docker-compose.yml in this attachment:
docker-compose.txt
(File extension on my server is still .yml, github doesn't support this fileformat)
This is the DockerFilePython's contents:
FROM python:3
RUN mkdir /API
WORKDIR /API
#COPY ./storage/API /API
RUN pip install -r ./Requirements/requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8080
The error message:
