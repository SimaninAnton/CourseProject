Docker 1.11 has a new client credentials store. This results in ~/.docker/config.json files which look a bit like this:
{
    "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
    },
    "credsStore": "osxkeychain"
}
This breaks Compose:
$ docker-compose up

Ideally, we should support the new client credentials store. As an intermediate step, we should probably not throw traceback and instead display a helpful error saying that it isn't supported yet.
