This is the same as #3429 but for volumes instead of networks.
My input yml:
version: '3'

networks:
  backend:
    external:
      name: backend

volumes:
  test-data:
    external:
      name: test-data

services:
  test:
    image: busybox
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    volumes:
      - test-data:/data
    networks:
      - backend
Result of docker-compose config:
networks:
  backend:
    external:
      name: backend
services:
  test:
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    image: busybox
    networks:
      backend: null
    volumes:
    - test-data:/data:rw
version: '3.0'
volumes:
  test-data:
    external:
      name: test-data
    external_name: test-data
The external_name included with the volume is considered invalid by docker stack deploy and should not be included in the output.
Background: I'm planning to use docker-compose to parse the yml files we use, merge multiple compose files together and expand variables, which can't be done by the docker stack deploy yml processor.
