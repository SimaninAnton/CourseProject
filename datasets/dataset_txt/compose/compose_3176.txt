With this Dockerfile
FROM busybox

RUN exit 1
and docker-compose.yml
service:
  build: .
Running
docker-compose build service
will fail because of the "RUN exit 1" and will leave in intermediate container there (which is completely unusable and useless).
There is an option for docker called --force-rm which fixes this but I see no option in compose for this.
Could there be one added?
Thanks!
