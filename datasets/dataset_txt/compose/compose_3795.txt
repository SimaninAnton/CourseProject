Hello all,
First I have to specify that I use docker-compose through boot2docker on Windows 8 with the snippet of dduportal. I work in a folder under /c/Users so I can edit my files from Windows.
Here is my problem, I have an app structured like this:
workspace/
-- docker-compose.yml
-- api/
---- Dockerfile
And here is the content of my docker-compose.yml:
api:
  build: ./api
  links:
   - mongo
   - redis
  ports:
   - "8010:8010"
mongo:
  image: mongo
redis:
  image: redis
When I build the image of api/ alone, the build is successful. When I first built the app using docker-compose, it was successful too.
Now I want to rebuild the app, docker-compose build fails:
Building api...
Traceback (most recent call last):

However I can still build the image of api/ alone with docker build.
I don't know if this is related to my project or docker, and google didn't help me.
