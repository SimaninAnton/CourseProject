Hi,
Is there a tool that anyone is aware of that takes a compose file and does the following?
Is it validate?
What is the minimum supported Composer and Docker for this version of the file?
What is the maximum supported Composer and Docker for this version of the file?
Show what is right for a given error message.
Ex. Using dc 1.8 this seems invalid:
version: "2.1"
and
version: "3"
but
version: "2" worked. However the particular error didn't give a pointer to the version matrix or the regex that would work (in fact, I didn't find a reason why 3 wouldn't work).
It is getting a little challenging to remember what is valid and what is not between versions.
Ideally Compose would be able to do this, but an external tool is great as well. If no one knows of one (I could not find one) maybe I can do it.
Happy new year!
