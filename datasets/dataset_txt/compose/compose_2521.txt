After running docker-compose up, a new bridge will be created.
docker network ls
NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER
f4f2af093035 bridge bridge
65b0cf530cec deploy_default bridge
0e2eb3cf1040 none null
b9d3550256af host host
Is it possible to customize the IP of the new bridge? I went through the docs and didn't find any information about this question.
