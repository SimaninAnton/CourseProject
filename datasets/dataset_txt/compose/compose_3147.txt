I have a little snippet in docker-compose.yml like:
volumes:
  - ${HOST_PATH}:/container/path
If I change the value of HOST_PATH any subsequent up or build, the container will still mount the volume with the old value of HOST_PATH.
Is this because volumes is not a run time option like docker -v or is this a bug?
