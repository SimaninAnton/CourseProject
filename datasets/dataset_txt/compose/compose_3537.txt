We have extends which is awesome, but I would like to flip it the other way around with an includes operator. Would it be possible to do something like this:
# web-common.yml
web: 
  image: nginx
  ports: 
    - "80:80"
# db-common.yml
db:
  image: postgres
  ports: 
    - "5432:5432"
# redis-common.yml
db:
  image: redis
  ports: 
    - "6379:6379"
# production-compose.yml
includes:
  - db-common.yml
  - redis-common.yml
  - web-common.yml
# development-compose.yml
includes:
  - db-common.yml
  - redis-common.yml

web: 
  extends:
    file: web-common.yml
    service: web
  command: bundle exec rails s -p 80 -b 0.0.0.0 thin
I may have missed this in the docs, but I don't see anything in the docs that explains how to do something like this, and I think it would be super useful and would reduce the amount of repeated config in projects.
