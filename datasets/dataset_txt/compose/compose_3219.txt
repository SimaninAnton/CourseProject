I had a yaml like:
redis:
  image: redis
  expose:
    - 6379

myapp:
  links:
    - postgres
    # forgot to link redis here
I did a docker-compose up -d and saw the problem with my app, it couldn't connect to hostname redis
no problem, I edited the yaml:
redis:
  image: redis
  expose:
    - 6379

myapp:
  links:
    - postgres
    - redis
I did a docker-compose up -d again expecting it to be fixed
nope ConnectionError: Error -2 connecting to redis:6379. Name or service not known
tried a docker-compose restart myapp... not fixed
restarted all services
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d
not fixed
exec'd into myapp and had a look in /etc/hosts ...I only have these entries:
172.17.0.219    postgres adddb7bd4709 oceania_postgres_1
172.17.0.219    postgres_1 adddb7bd4709 oceania_postgres_1
172.17.0.219    oceania_postgres_1.bridge
172.17.0.220    oceania_redis_1
172.17.0.220    oceania_redis_1.bridge
so, obviously problem is due to the missing link entry for redis container
it's a bit weird because normally this 'just works'
