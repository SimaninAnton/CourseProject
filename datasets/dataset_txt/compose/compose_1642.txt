This works with docker:
$ diff <(docker run -i busybox echo A) <(docker run -i busybox echo B)
1c1
< A
---
> B
On docker-compose:
$ diff <(docker-compose run web sh -c "echo A")  <(docker-compose run web sh -c "echo B")
ERROR: Cannot create container for service web: Conflict. The container name "/r_web_run_4" is already in use by container b68344642f06c1035dba53416d6f504f84173223aa2e145638ab07ad0b81806d. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.

Pressing some enters after the command execution:
$ diff <(docker-compose run web sh -c "echo A")  <(docker-compose run web sh -c "echo B")
