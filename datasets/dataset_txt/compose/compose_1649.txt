Hi!
My application can not resolve names of services. I have created next config file:
version : '3'
services:
wcf1:
build: cnt1
expose:
- "8733"
wcf2:
build: cnt3
expose:
- "8733"
wa1:
build: cnt2
ports:
- "80:80"
links:
- wcf1
- wcf2
depends_on:
- wcf1
- wcf2
networks:
default:
external:
name: "nat"
But application from wa1 can not resolve names wcf1 and wcf2. I have done some tests on wa1 with nslookup and it shows me addresses:
C:\webapplication>nslookup
Default Server: UnKnown
Address: 172.25.16.1
> wcf1
Server: UnKnown
Address: 172.25.16.1
Non-authoritative answer:
Name: wcf1
Address: 172.25.29.136
> wcf2
Server: UnKnown
Address: 172.25.16.1
Non-authoritative answer:
Name: wcf2
Address: 172.25.29.126
Ping works by address:
C:\webapplication>ping 172.25.29.136
Pinging 172.25.29.136 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 172.25.29.136: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
Reply from 172.25.29.136: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
But does not work by name:
C:\webapplication>ping wcf1
Ping request could not find host wcf1. Please check the name and try again.
