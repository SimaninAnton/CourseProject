When installing docker-compose through pip, the installation can conflict with existing websockets package (already provided by the distribution/not installed through pip) as described here: #1996
While this can be worked around by the user and I understand this is somewhat expected given the limitations of pip and the inherent problem of installing something system-wide with distribution python packages around and no use of virtualenv, I believe there are ways to improve the handling of this:
Idea 1: Catch the ImportError of the websocket package and display a helpful message which describes the problem, and suggests to the user to either wget docker-compose as a finished working package or remove the distribution's websocket package and try reinstalling it with pip to get a compatible version.
Idea 2: Figure out how to change the pip package so it somehow installs the correct websockets thing right away even with distribution packages around. (I have no idea of pip so I guess this might be impossible, I'm just adding it here in case there are ways to do this and nobody has bothered to try it)
At least the first one should be easily doable and would be a vast improvement for people running into this issue. If other approaches are despite being possible too much effort, please at least consider the first idea of a simple more descriptive helpful error message.
