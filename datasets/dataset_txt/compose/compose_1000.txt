I have a container like this:
  my_container:
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: ./some/host/path
        target: /some/container/path
        read_only: true
This used to work with docker-compose 1.17.1, but when I switched to Docker edge containing 1.18.0-rc2, the syntax broke and I got this kind of error when running docker-compose build :
ERROR: Named volume "{u'read_only': True, u'source': 'some/host/path', u'type': 'volume', u'target': '/some/container/path'}" is used in service "my_container" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.
