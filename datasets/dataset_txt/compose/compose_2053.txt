I have 2 projects, both live in a directory named app/ and both define a service named web in their docker-compose.yml file:
.
├── a
│   └── app
│       ├── docker-compose.yml
│       └── Dockerfile
└── b
    └── app
        ├── docker-compose.yml
        └── Dockerfile
a/app/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
    web:
        build: ./
        image: a_image
        container_name: a_container
b/app/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
    web:
        build: ./
        image: b_image
        container_name: b_container
Now when I start the web service in project a, then go to project b, docker-compose mistakenly operates on the containers for project a:
$ cd a/app
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting a_container
$ docker-compose ps
   Name            Command           State             Ports         
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a_container   apache2-foreground   Restarting   0.0.0.0:9002->80/tcp 

$ cd ../../b/app
$ docker-compose ps
   Name            Command           State             Ports         
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a_container   apache2-foreground   Restarting   0.0.0.0:9002->80/tcp
It works correctly if I change the service name from web to e.g. web_b - but I don't want that. The same setup worked fine with docker-compose 1.7.0. It seems like in only happens after upgrading to 1.8.0. I also see this on multiple machines now.
My docker version is 1.12.1.
