(docker-compose v1.4.2, docker v1.8.2, ubuntu trusty)
I was seeing situations where a command, while in one directory, would affect containers reference by the .yml in another directory. I realized that this occurs when the directories have the same name.
For instance, I've got this directory structure. Note that the root dirs for the projects are both called config
- A
     - config
          - docker-compose.yml
- B
     - config
          - docker-compose.yml
And the .yml files are the same except for the container name:
redis:
  image:  redis
  container_name: redis_container_(A or B)
If I start A then go to B and start that, B doesn't start, it recreates A. Here's the flow:
/tmp/dockerComposeTest/A/config$ docker-compose up -d
Creating redis_container_A...
/tmp/dockerComposeTest/A/config$ cd ../../B/config/
/tmp/dockerComposeTest/B/config$ docker-compose up -d
Recreating redis_container_A...                                                   # !!!
/tmp/dockerComposeTest/B/config$
I've seen this with stop, kill, etc.
This will NOT happen with the following dir structure, presumably because the root directory names are different.
- A
     - docker-compose.yml
- B
     - docker-compose.yml
