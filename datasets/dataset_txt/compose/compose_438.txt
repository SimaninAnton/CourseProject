Hi Team,
I have installed docker
dev-box:/HelloWorld$ docker --version
Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build d72f525745
under a fresh Alpine 3.8.1. install
and then I have installed docker-compose ...
... but when I want to use it I got this error
dev-box:/HelloWorld$ docker-compose
Error relocating /usr/lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0: getrandom: symbol not found
What does it mean ? And how to solve it ?
Best Regards
Bernard
