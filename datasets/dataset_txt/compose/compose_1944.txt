I was not getting any colorized output as you can see here:
So as per #2231 I tried using tty: true in service configuration, which did the trick and gave me colors but not like when using run -t ... as you can see I've some char encoding issues;
What could be the issue about the encoding of the chars as docker run -t... gives me the correct output?
Kinda improvement on version update
1.8.0 => 1.8.1, build 878cff1
So I updated to 1.8.1 as this might solve the issue and now I'm getting utf8 chars with a messy output (not using tty: true makes it non-messy but not colorized)
Any ideas, hints? I've the feeling there is a small bug behind this.
