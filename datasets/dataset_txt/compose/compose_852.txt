The docker-compose shell wrapper from 'run as a container' installation does not work on Mac as it is looking for the realpath command:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose
sudo curl -L --fail https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.19.0/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

COMPOSE_FILE=docker/rancher-docker-compose.yml /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up
Docker for Mac's native binary version of docker-compose works normally.
