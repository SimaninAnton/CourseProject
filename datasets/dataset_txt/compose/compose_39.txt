docker-compose status hangs when making any http call to docker daemon. It was fine using macOS Mojave, I upgraded to Catalina and not it is very slow
I tried all the solutions mentioned above, new docker-compose , using mac binaries etc.
docker compose is very slow on mac catalina, please provide fix
I have installed latest version of docker on mac, and also checked other fixes and bug reports i.e. #7010 and #6956
No fixes are working, it is still very slow
