With the following container we are getting an error creating the container:
  dynamodb:
    image: instructure/dynamo-local-admin
    labels:
      - "com.acuris.service.group=companyhub"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
When we run the command:
docker-compose run dynamodb
We get the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/bin/docker-compose", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())

ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 35; 2 is required
However, if we change the container definition to the following then it works:
  dynamodb:
    image: instructure/dynamo-local-admin
    labels:
      com.acuris.service.group: companyhub
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
This has only started failing since we upgraded to docker-compose version 1.17.0, build ac53b73.
