I'm getting following error while trying to do docker-compose up on Windows 10 machine:
docker-compose.exe up
Traceback (most recent call last):

docker-compose returned -1
Should be the latest release:
docker-compose.exe version
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build d988a55
docker-py version: 1.9.0
CPython version: 2.7.11
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2d 9 Jul 2015
It's probably caused by my username, it contains character "Ã¤". There are many similar issues, but they seem to be fixed, but not for me unfortunately.
