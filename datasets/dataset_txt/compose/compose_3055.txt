A bit of background
I'm building MariaDB Galera server image that automatically creates cluster (with single node initially and 2+ nodes when running docker-compose scale mariadb=x, were x is target number of nodes).
It works, but there are few caveats, one of which is topic of this issue.
When I want to upgrade containers to newer versions of images I initially run docker-compose pull to get new images.
But if I run docker-compose --x-networking up -d right after this all MariaDB containers will be restarted quickly and eventually nodes will lost quorum and cluster will be effectively destroyed.
To overcome this I decided to increase cluster size even further, wait for new nodes to replicate and then to upgrade the rest of containers.
But here is the problem - when I run docker-compose --x-networking up -d it recreates all MariaDB containers, even those that already having up to date version of image.
TL;DR edition
# Simplified version of /x/docker-compose.yml
data:
  image: nazarpc/webserver:data
mariadb:
  image: nazarpc/webserver:mariadb
  environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: mariadb
  volumes_from:
    - data
docker-compose --x-networking up -d
# ^ Running cluster with one node, wait to start properly
docker-compose --x-networking scale mariadb=2
# ^ Now we have second node joining cluster, wait to start and replicate properly
docker-compose pull
# ^ Whoops, we have new version of `nazarpc/webserver:mariadb` image
docker-compose --x-networking scale mariadb=3
# ^ Third node joining cluster, based on newer image
docker-compose --x-networking up -d
Expected result:
x_mariadb_1 and x_mariadb_2 containers recreated with newer images, x_mariadb_3 doesn't change since it is up to date already
Actual result:
x_mariadb_3 container is also recrected, while has already up to date image, which is not expected/desired behavior
