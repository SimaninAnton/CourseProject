docker-compose -f always-on-prod.yml --x-networking up -d
this extends always-on.yml which on it side extends common.yml which has
env_file:
- env
always-on-prod.yml defines its own env_file
env_file:
- env-prod
the problem is that envs defined in the env-prod don't override the envs defined in common.yml
I think this worked as expected before I upgraded from 1.5.0
Docker version 1.9.0, build 76d6bc9
docker-compose version: 1.6.0dev
