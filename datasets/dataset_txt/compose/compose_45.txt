Hi,
I have a docker-compose which is resposible for running my application's UI, API and DB. My UI is built on React and I have mounted a volume so that I continue to develop the application. However, the UI does not update when I change any files (not even if I manually reload the page), I have used docker exec to verify that the files are being changed in the container.
The following is my docker-compose file:
version: '3'

services:
  ui:
    build: ./docker.dses-ui/
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    depends_on:
      - api
    volumes:
      - ./docker.dses-ui/dses-ui/src:/usr/src/app

  api:
    build: ./docker.dses-api/dses-api/.
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    build: ./docker.dses-db/postgres/.
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    expose: 
      - '5432'
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
