I've had some trouble getting a fig environment up and running and I wonder whether this is my not understanding some details of the set-up process or could actually be a feature request.
If the first case applies and I just didn't understand how things tie together, maybe just a single sentence in the tutorial and/or docs on the fig website could help.
So, my issue is that I just couldn't get two docker containers to work together using fig. Let's say I used the official wordpress and mysql images.
Now, running this "manually" using docker, one would link these two together like this:
docker run --name wp --link mysql:mysql wordpress
Which would then make the MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP environment variable available to the wordpress container.
However, what fig does, even when not using the scale parameter, is to rename the containers using numbers (as explained here: http://www.fig.sh/env.html), so that actually the variable [HOST]_[ALIAS/SERVICE]1_PORT[EXPOSEDPORT]_TCP is created instead. Which makes whatever script is running inside the wordpress container complain that the environment variable is not set or maybe --link has been omitted.
Which, in return, led me to the conclusion that stock docker images cannot be used with fig, if they have not been prepared for such an environment.
Now, if this is true and not only my misunderstanding or overlooking something, then maybe fig could add what I would call a "compatibility mode" that would actually use the defined service names as link aliases and make the environment variables available as [ALIAS]PORT[EXPOSEDPORT]_TCP.
Thanks for your feedback and comments.
