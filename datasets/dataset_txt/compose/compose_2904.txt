I get the following error while trying to do docker-compose ps or docker-compose pull. Happens with 1.6.0-RC1 and 1.5.2 (well in reality 1.5.2 blows up only when installing from pip, so I guess the bug is in docker-py).
Docker version: 1.9.1
# docker-compose pull
Traceback (most recent call last):

Of course the docker daemon is up and in good health.
