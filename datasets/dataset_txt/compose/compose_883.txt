According to the YAML spec, when in flow style, leading whitespace (tabs or spaces) is "neither content nor indentation." whereas in a docker compose file specified as *.json or *.yml a trivial case of valid flow style cosmetically indented with tabs
{
 "version": "3",
 "services": {
  "test": {}
 }
}
results in a YAML parse error:
ERROR: yaml.scanner.ScannerError: while scanning for the next token
found character '\t' that cannot start any token
Which is incorrect for tokens in flow mode.
This is for docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9 on MacOS
