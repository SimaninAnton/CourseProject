I have my docker engine startup configured with:
{
  "bip": "172.80.0.1/16",
  "fixed-cidr": "172.80.0.0/16"
}
but if I start a compose without any network config it creates a bridge with subnet 172.17.0.0/16.
When the docker engine was running with default config it created docker0 with subnet 172.17.0.0/16 and when running compose the bridge network was created with subnet 172.18.0.0/16
Is this the expected behavior? How / where does compose gets the "default" network config from? Is there a way to change this globally to avoid spreading the following config on every compose.yaml?
networks:
  default:
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.177.0.0/16
Thanks.
