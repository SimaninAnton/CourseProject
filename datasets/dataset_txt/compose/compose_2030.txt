Hi,
docker-compose started adding a trailing hyphen to both host and container hostnames, after I switched to docker-compose V2 file format and network_mode: "host"
The original host's hostname is "foo" and docker compose changes it to "foo-"
I would like to keep the container's hostname same as the host. Is it possible?
Here is my docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: <mi image>
    command: node server.js
    ports:
      - 80:80
    container_name: somename
    restart: "always"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=80
    network_mode: "host"
    devices:
        - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"
        - "/dev/mem:/dev/mem"
    privileged: true
    cap_add:
      - ALL
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
  db:
    image: cretzel/rpi-mongodb
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: "always"
    ports:
      - 27017
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - /var/data/db:/data/db
