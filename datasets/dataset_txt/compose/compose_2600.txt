It would be great in dynamic environment with multiple networks and connectivity to have the ability to define filters based on the ip address of the nodes.
If the node has the specific IP
service1:
environment:
- "affinity:ipaddress==10.10.10.10"
If the node is part of the network
service2:
environment:
- "affinity:ipaddress=~10.10.10"
...etc
