I've got a docker container running Node 8.9.4. I can build the container fine and I can run 'up' on docker compose fine. It will start the webpack dev server or my node server without issues.
When I run docker-compose up, webpack runs and it tells me it is running on port 8000. In my docker-compose file, I map that port so I can access it. But I am never able to access the page. It is as if port mapping is not working at all. Everything runs fine in the container, but nothing ever leaves the container.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Here is my .Dockerfile:
FROM node:8.9.4
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code
COPY . /code/
RUN yarn install
And here is my docker-compose.ym:
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: yarn run dev-server
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
And here is the output from running docker-compose up:
