I'm not sure if this is a feature of a bug. I've installed docker-compose version: 1.4.0 from homebrew and I'm seeing logs getting preserved across runs:
docker-compose.yml
helloworld:
  image: busybox
  command: echo "Hello World!"
Here's the log of multiple docker-compose up:
~/dockercompose-test ❯❯❯ docker-compose up
Starting dockercomposetest_helloworld_1...
Attaching to dockercomposetest_helloworld_1
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
dockercomposetest_helloworld_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
~/dockercompose-test ❯❯❯ docker-compose up
Starting dockercomposetest_helloworld_1...
Attaching to dockercomposetest_helloworld_1
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
dockercomposetest_helloworld_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
~/dockercompose-test ❯❯❯ docker-compose up
Starting dockercomposetest_helloworld_1...
Attaching to dockercomposetest_helloworld_1
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
helloworld_1 | Hello World!
dockercomposetest_helloworld_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
~/dockercompose-test ❯❯❯ docker-compose --version
As you can see the logs are getting preserved across the runs.
