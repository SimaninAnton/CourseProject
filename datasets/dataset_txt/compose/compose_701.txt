Hello;
When using compatibility mode, if there is an attachable flag declared in networks It is expected to run as a regular docker-compose stack. Example as follows:
 networks:
   foonetwork:
-    driver: overlay
-    attachable: true
However, this config asks for local swarm cluster. When I run the docker-compose --compatibility config command, I can still see the attachable: true flag, which requires a version 3.2v compose file. It seems like a conversion bug in docker-compose config
