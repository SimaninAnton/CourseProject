It should be possible to specify the name of an image, and the path it can be built from. Like so:
web:
  image: hyperglobalmegacorp/web
  build: .
This lets you do various things:
Bootstrap an environment by pulling pre-built master images from the Hub so you don't have to build them locally when setting up an initial environment (docker-compose pull; docker-compose up)
Lets you easily push images that you have built
Lets you customise the name of the built image
Makes it easier to use the same Compose file in development and production (production can pull images in advance or ignore build)
