Since 17.12.0 there is support in docker swarm for gpu devices such as nvidia cuda .
You can create a service that requires a gpu resource like so:
docker service create -t --generic-resource "gpu=1" ubuntu bash
However there is no way to do this via docker-compose as far as I understand.
For reference the relevant github issue comment is here
Is there a plan to add this in compose?
