docker network create -d transparent --gateway 10.31.0.01 --subnet=10.31.0.0/16 -o com.docker.network.windowsshim.interface="Ethernet" backend

docker network ls
see it is there
docker network rm backend
fails with HSN failed with error : The parameter is incorrect.
docker network ls 
only see nat, null
restart docker service
docker network ls
see a new random network with just the hash for the name (ex: b3631004b54cb3e6c36f004eee21d7a239357e23b84141f6085d37ae048c491d)
try to re-add with the same above command and get that the network already exists
Remove the network now by ID.
can re-add
