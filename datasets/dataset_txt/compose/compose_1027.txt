Hi,
I'm a noobie with docker/compose and i just had a weird problem..
When i tried to pass args from the compose file to the dockerfile my args were always empty/blank oO
# Compose file
version: '3'
services:
    postgres:
        build:
            context: ./postgres
            args:
                PG_PWD: qwer
        ports:
            - 5432:5432
# Dockerfile 
ARG PG_PWD
FROM mdillon/postgis

USER postgres
RUN echo "${PG_PWD}"
So i ended up switching the order of ARG and FROM and it worked !
FROM mdillon/postgis
ARG PG_PWD
Maybe i missed it in the docs but i can't find anywhere saying that you must put ARG after the FROM statement :/. Would be cool to see it in https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#args
