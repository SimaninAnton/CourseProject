As a developer, I have a million different projects and now they're all using docker with compose. I have a project structure like:
/flatscanner
    /www
        index.html
    /api
        index.php
    /docker
        docker-compose.yml


/konoro
    /www
        index.html
    /api
        index.php
    /docker
        docker-compose.yml
To bring up all the services for a service, I go to it's docker directory and up -d, but the prefix is based on the folder, so is always docker_ and I'm getting conflicts as they use similar services: nginx, mysql, redis etc.
In order to keep them unique, I need to create another folder inside /docker with the project name so the containers are prefixed with the project name instead:
/flatscanner
    /www
    /api
    /docker
        /flatscanner
            docker-compose.yml


/konoro
    /www
    /api
    /docker
        /konoro
            docker-compose.yml
I feel like the folder prefix should be configurable, so I can have a YML file like:
version: '2',
prefix: 'flatscanner'
services:
    nginx
        image: 'nginx'
Then I'll have containers like: flatscanner_nginx_1 and konoro_nginx_1 instead a conflicting service called docker_nginx_1
