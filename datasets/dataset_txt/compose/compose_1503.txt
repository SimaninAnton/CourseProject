Hello there,
I'm trying to run a dockerized project which is deployed with Capistrano
My application is located within /opt/hosting/my-project directory with the following structure :
/opt/hosting/my-project
    /current -> releases/201704251234/
    /releases/201704251234/
    /repo/
    revisions.log
    /shared/
Currently, what I'm trying to do is simply :
cd /opt/hosting/my-project/current
docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d
This fails with the following error :
ERROR: Couldn't find env file: /opt/hosting/my-project/shared/.env
This is the content of my docker-compose-production.yml
version: "2"

services:
  app:
    build: ./
    container_name: myproject_app
    env_file:
      - /opt/hosting/my-project/shared/.env
    expose:
      - 9000
    volumes:
      - /opt/hosting/my-project/:/opt/hosting
The .env file needed exists, is readable and doesn't seem to contain any error.
My docker-compose -v :
docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
Does anyone have an idea on why this is failing ?
Cheers !
