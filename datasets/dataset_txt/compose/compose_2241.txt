Hi:
I understand that I can override, in my docker-compose.yml, the CMD or ENTRYPOINT,
however, in general, I do not want to perform an override operation.
The executable provided as PID 1 is exactly what we want.
I just want to pass ARGs to my executable (not to the docker-compose.yml and not as environment variables). There are particular, well-determined flags that my executable needs.
I just want to make sure that the override (entrypoint) is as efficient as it can be
or I'd like to ask for an enhancement request so that I can pass the right arguments (flags) to my exe PID 1 and of course specify them in the docker-compose.yml definition
Example of possible implementation
services:
XYZservice:
image: myImage:myTag
image_exec_args:
- -xstart=bla.sh
- -consolelog=1
- -shmem=32GB
the above -xstart -consolelog and -shmem are a series of params or flags I need to pass to the Entrypoint executable.
Thank you
