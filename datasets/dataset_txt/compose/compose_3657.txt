Consider following docker-compose.yml:
web:
    build: .
    links:
        - db
db:
    image: mysql
I run the services.
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating project_db_1...
Creating project_web_1...
$
When I want to restart (recreate) my web service after some changes, I issue:
$ docker-compose up -d web
Recreating project_db_1...
Recreating project_web_1...
$ 
I would normally expect only my web service to start without interrupting the depending services.
But it doesn't happen so. The dependent services should not be re-created when recreating depending services. Dependent should only be started if not running already.
On the other hand, if I re-create dependent service, the depending service should be re-created, which does not happen.
$ docker-compose up -d db
Recreating project_db_1...
$ 
The web service then loses the link and has no idea of the new db service.
