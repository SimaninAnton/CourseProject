I am currently putting together a docker-compose backed app, and in order to ship the config to another team member, they would have to pull the whole git project, seems to me that there should be a way to share various clusters with people, so in the same way that docker hub shares images, it would be neat to share compose files.
Is this in the road map, or does this exist an i am just blind?
Thanks.
