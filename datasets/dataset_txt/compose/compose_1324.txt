I have two services and each service calls dockerfile which has microsoft/windowsservercore as a base image.
When I run docker-compose up on windows, the containers are getting stopped immediately however same yaml file on linux keeps containers running. is there any known issue on windows?
my docker-compose.yml file is:
version: '3'

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: nat

services:
  awi-service:
    env_file:
      - awi-box.env
    image: awi-box:12.0.0
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
    - ae-service
    

  ae-service:
    env_file:
      - ae-box.env
    image: ar-box:12.0.0
    ports:
    -  2217:2217
    -  2218:2218
