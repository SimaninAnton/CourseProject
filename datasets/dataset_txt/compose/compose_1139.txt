I'm pretty sure this used to work:
docker-compose run --rm foo ls -l
But now it fails with
/bin/ls: /bin/ls: cannot execute binary file
I believe this is because somehow bash is getting set as the entrypoint (despite the fact that bash does not appear in docker-compose.yml nor the Dockerfile ... perhaps in the image the Dockerfile inherits FROM?), so it's trying to run ls as a bash script.
This works, but I find it a more awkward command line to construct:
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint 'ls -l' foo
