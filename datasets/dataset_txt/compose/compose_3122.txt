Started an application using https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images/blob/master/wildfly-mysql-javaee7/docker-compose.yml as:
docker-compose --x-networking up -d
Creating network "wildflymysqljavaee7" with driver "None"
Creating wildflymysqljavaee7_mywildfly_1
Creating db
docker-compose --x-networking up -d
Creating network "wildflymysqljavaee7" with driver "None"
Creating wildflymysqljavaee7_mywildfly_1
Creating db
Compose creates a bridge network (related to #2345). Stopping and removing the application remove the network as well.
docker-compose --x-networking stop has no effect as well.
Good thing is the network is not created with every invocation of docker compose up -d.
