When I run docker-compose -f dev.yml build, the build fails with an error
postgres uses an image, skipping
Building django
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
However, start the default docker machine doesn't solve the issue. I noticed that the verbose error message is similar to issue #2927 but again the suggested fix doesn't work.
docker-compose --verbose -f dev.yml build
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: ./dev.yml

docker-compose returned -1
My versions are:
Docker version 1.10.2, build c3959b1
docker-machine version 0.1.0
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
My dev.yml looks like this
postgres:
  image: postgres:9.5
  volumes:
    - /data/dev/renooble_cnn_demo/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data

django:
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-dev
  build: .
  command: python /app/manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  links:
    - postgres
Do you have any suggestions why docker-compose is failing while creating the build?
