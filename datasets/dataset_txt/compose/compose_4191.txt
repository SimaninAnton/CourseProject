Docker (v 1.2.0) now has an option for restart so containers can auto restart after machine/host reboot:
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#run
--restart=""  Restart policy to apply when a container exits (no, on-failure[:max-retry], always)
Can we have that option in fig.yml? An e.g:
web:
  image: test/myweb
  restart: always
db:
  image: test/mydb
  restart: always
or more brilliant way, it will restart app stack (web and db):
restart: always
web:
  image: test/myweb
db:
  image: test/mydb
Thanks.
