Hi,
I've seen a few people having this issue but can't see a way to resolve my issue.
Running "docker-compose up" seems to hang when getting to attach.
I'm not doing anything fancy at the moment as I was just getting a working prototype first:
web:
  image: my-image
  ports:
    - 80
    - 443
  volumes:
    - .:/var/www
I've downloaded the most up to date toolbox to my Mac, these are the versions I'm running...
Mac OSX: 10.11.1
Docker: Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7
Docker compose: docker-compose version: 1.4.2
Thanks,
Gary
