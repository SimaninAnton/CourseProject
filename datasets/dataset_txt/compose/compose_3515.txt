This comment in #551 indicates that the following syntax should work for passing SSH_AUTH_SOCK into a container:
volumes:
    - $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK
environment:
    - SSH_AUTH_SOCK
However, resolve_host_path in config.py does exactly as it's named, it resolves the host path but not the container path.
This means that the snippet pasted above results in a volume like this:
['/tmp/ssh-4NokVWqj63/agent.10499:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK']
Instead of resolve_host_paths/resolve_host_path, the functions should probably be resolve_path/resolve_paths and resolve both host and container paths.
