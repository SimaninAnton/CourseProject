With latest 1.10.0-rc1 docker compose, slash in .dockerignore cannot be recognized. It will have below errors with this .dockerginore file.
*
!obj/Docker/publish/*
!obj/Docker/empty/
Building webapplication1
Service 'webapplication1' failed to build: GetFileAttributesEx obj\Docker\empty: The system cannot find the path specified..
Note: slash works well in 1.9.0.
