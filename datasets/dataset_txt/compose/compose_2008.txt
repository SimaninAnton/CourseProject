I am playing with Docker Compose and volumes
version: '2'
services:
    php-apache:
        env_file:
          - dev_variables.env
        image: reypm/php55-dev
        build:
            context: .
            args:
                - PUID=1000
                - PGID=1000
        expose:
            - "80"
            - "9001"
        extra_hosts:
            # IMPORTANT: Replace with your Docker Host IP (will be appended to /etc/hosts)
            - "dockerhost:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
        volumes_from:
            - volumes_source
    volumes_source:
        image: tianon/true
        volumes:
            - ../:/var/www
    volumes_data:
        image: tianon/true
        volumes:
            - ./data/sessions:/sessions
Let's take the following facts:
I have a directory under the host at: ~/var/www
The data in such directory should persist regarding container status.
The container should write the data from the host under /var/www
I have read docs here but is not clear to me how to deal with data volumes and host data.
I want to share the data on the host with the container but I don't even know if the docker-compose.yml file above is right or what needs to be changed in order to achieve what I need. I know how to do it using docker run alone but doesn't have a clue for Docker Compose?
Can any help me to get this working?
Update: playing with this
I have added this lines to the docker-compose.yml file:
    volumes_from:
        - volumes_source
And I run the docker-compose up once again but this is the result:
php55devwork_volumes_data_1 exited with code 0
php55devwork_volumes_source_1 exited with code 0
I am not sure what is happening or why I am getting the error, any?
