I have a container like
postfix:
    build: postfix
    ports:
        - "25:25"
    volumes_from:
        - mailspool
    links:
        - dovecot:dovecot
    external_links:
        - mariadb_single_container:mariadb
It was working fine, but after a recent system reboot, the external_links container is not linked. The environment variables associated with the mariadb container are no longer being set, and it doesn't appear in /etc/hosts either. The mariadb container itself looks fine, and it's being used by other containers that don't use docker-compose. The dovecot container link is working fine. I've restarted the postfix container to make sure it's not something to do with the order the containers came up.
docker-compose restart gives no errors/warnings. Using the --verbose flag doesn't provide anything that looks helpful.
Any suggestions as to what might be going wrong?
