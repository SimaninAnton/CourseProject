As a new Fig user, 99% of the Fig tools are awesome and "accessible"; people can jump in and start using. It would be nice, however, that if fig up creates and starts containers then perhaps fig down should stop the containers.
Having fig start/stop and fig up/kill is confusing at first.
Would just be a nice feature. Thanks.
