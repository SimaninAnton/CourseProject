Hi,
It will be very helpful to have something like "onrun" in the YAML to be able to run commands after the run. Similar to moby/moby#8860
mongodb:
    image: mongo:3.0.2
    hostname: myhostname
    domainname: domain.lan
    volumes:
        - /data/mongodb:/data
    ports:
        - "27017:27017" 
    onrun:
        - mongodump --host db2dump.domain.lan --port 27017 --out /data/mongodb/dumps/latest
        - mongorestore -d database /data/mongodb/dumps/latest/database
After the mongodb start, It will dump db2dump.domain.lan and restore it.
When I will stop and then start the container, onrun part will no be executed to preserve idempotency.
