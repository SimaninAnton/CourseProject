I'm having issues with docker-compose connecting to a swarm cluster.
I have a docker engine running locally on port 2375 and swarm running on port 2376. There are 3 physical machines in the cluster. The docker clients points to the swarm so, doing the following returns the cluster information.
$ docker info
Containers: 7
Images: 28
Role: primary
Strategy: spread
Filters: affinity, health, constraint, port, dependency
Nodes: 3
 swarm-1: 192.168.116.98:2375

My DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 points to swarm now.
I can do docker ps and docker info to see the cluster status, however docker-compose up complains saying:
$ docker-compose --verbose up -d
Compose version 1.3.3
Docker base_url: http://127.0.0.1:2376
Docker version: KernelVersion=, Arch=amd64, ApiVersion=1.16, Version=swarm/0.3.0, GitCommit=28cd51b, Os=linux, GoVersion=go1.3.3
docker containers <- (all=True, filters={u'label': [u'com.docker.compose.project=dockerengine', u'com.docker.compose.service=redis', u'com.docker.compose.oneoff=False']})
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http://127.0.0.1:2376 - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
What could be the problem?
I can even do docker run --rm -it centos bash and Swarm will start the container and put me into the bash session.
So Swarm is working fine, but docker-compose version 1.3.3 cannot connect to Swarm
Can anybody suggest any ideas?
My docker-compose.yml is simple for testing purpose:
mongo:
  image: mongo:3.0.4
  ports:
   - "27017:27017"
redis:
  image: redis:2.8
  ports:
   - "6379:6379"
