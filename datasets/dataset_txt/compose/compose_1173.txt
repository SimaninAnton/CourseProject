PR #4649 says that it fixes #4378, which is the usage of port range in docker-compose.
But it does not work (or I'm missing something).
I've made a very simple docker-compose to test it
version: '3.3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - 4200-4500:80
with docker-compose version : 1.17.0dev (same result with 1.16.1)
and docker : 17.06.0-ce
I've checked the source code, and it seems that there is no test for this use case.
The docker-compose.yml in the test/fixtures/ports-composefile miss an case with port range.
