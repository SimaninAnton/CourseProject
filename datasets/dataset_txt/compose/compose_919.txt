Hi, I am getting this error when I run the docker-compose up command
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file '.\docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Additional properties are not allowed ('links', 'database', 'image', 'express', 'ports', 'build', 'Services', 'angular' were unexpected)
You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version ("2.0", "2.1", "3.0", "3.1", "3.2") and place your s
ervice definitions under the services key, or omit the version key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
