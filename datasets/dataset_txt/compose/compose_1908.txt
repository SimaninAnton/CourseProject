I know that there is another issue of the same type but the other issue is closed and I tried all the solutions proposed but with no effect.
still not working:
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ sudo docker -v
Docker version 1.12.3, build 6b644ec
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ sudo docker-compose up
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ sudo service docker start
start: Job is already running: docker
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ echo $DOCKER_HOST

matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ DOCKER_HOST=127.0.0.1
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ echo $DOCKER_HOST
127.0.0.1
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ sudo docker-compose up
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?

matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ unset DOCKER_HOST
matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ sudo docker-compose up
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?

matteo@ubuntuDockerMB:~/wordpress-docker$ groups matteo
matteo : matteo adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev sambashare lpadmin docker
I'm part of the docker group
I'm using also sudo
The process is up
The DOCKER_HOST variable is unset or 127.0.0.1
Reconnected the user
Restarted the server
I think that I've tried all the possible configurations am I right?
Specs:
OS: Ubuntu 14.04.04 on Virtualbox on Windows 10 Home.
Docker version 1.12.3, build 6b644ec
Thank You!
