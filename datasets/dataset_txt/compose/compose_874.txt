While working on a larger project, I noticed that the restart behaviour is unreliable. According to the documentation restart seems pretty simple:
no is the default restart policy, and it does not restart a container under any circumstance. When always is specified, the container always restarts. The on-failure policy restarts a container if the exit code indicates an on-failure error.
restart: "no"
restart: always
restart: on-failure
restart: unless-stopped
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#restart
Unfortunately, using Docker for Mac (version: 17.12.0-ce-mac49) that behaviour was unreliable. The example below uses this docker-compose.yml file:
version: '3'

services:
    restart_on_failure:
        container_name: restart_on_failure
        image: alpine:latest
        restart: on-failure
        command: /bin/sh -c "date; exit 1"
It appears that the restart policy is ignored on the first launch:
cadams@jupiter:~/Desktop $ docker-compose up

This means that using --force-recreate will prevent it from ever being restarted, with no indication for why:
cadams@jupiter:~/Desktop $ docker-compose up --force-recreate
Recreating restart_on_failure ... done
Attaching to restart_on_failure
restart_on_failure    | Mon Feb 12 20:15:47 UTC 2018
restart_on_failure exited with code 1
cadams@jupiter:~/Desktop $ docker-compose up --force-recreate
Recreating restart_on_failure ... done

restart_on_failure    | Mon Feb 12 20:15:56 UTC 2018
restart_on_failure exited with code 1
Curiously, this is not consistent with multiple containers - using this Dockerfile, it usually but not always will restart as expected:
version: '3'

services:
    restart_on_failure:
        container_name: restart_on_failure
        image: alpine:latest
        restart: on-failure
        command: /bin/sh -c "date; exit 1"
    restart_unless_stopped:
        container_name: restart_unless_stopped
        image: alpine:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        command: /bin/sh -c "date; exit 1"
    restart_always:
        container_name: restart_always
        image: alpine:latest
        restart: always
        command: /bin/sh -c "date; exit 1"
