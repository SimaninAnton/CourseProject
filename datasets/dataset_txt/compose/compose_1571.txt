Version 1.11.2 of docker-compose bundled in Docker for Mac 17.03.0-ce fails to run for some users. According to the report in docker/for-mac#1428 it fails like this:
 docker-compose --version
Traceback (most recent call last):

Failed to execute script docker-compose
For many people (including me) it's totally fine, but several users report this error.
The compose binary comes from https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.2/docker-compose-Darwin-x86_64
I don't know how to debug it further -- any pointers would be appreciated!
