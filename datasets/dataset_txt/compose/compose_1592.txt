Hi all!
docker-compose version 1.11.2, build dfed245
I wanted to use docker-compose config output with override file to build my stack file for 1.13.1 stacks+secrets. As I understand it, using config is the proper way to override since docker stack deploy doesn't take overrides yet.
If I try: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml config
Problem: In output, the root secrets: is missing regardless if I try file: or external:. Note it shows up fine with assigning in services, but no root definition is shown:
docker-compose.yml
version: '3.1'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:9.6
docker-compose.test.yml
version: '3.1'
services:
  postgres:
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/psql-pw
    secrets:
      - psql-pw
secrets:
  psql-pw:
    file: psql-fake-password.txt
output
networks: {}
services:
  postgres:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/psql-pw
    image: postgres:9.6
    secrets:
    - source: psql-pw
version: '3.1'
volumes: {}
Is this expected and just a missing feature, or a bug?
