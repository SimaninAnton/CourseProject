Hi,
I am trying to build a elasticsearch cluster using docker swarm (1.0), docker compose(1.51) and the network overlay.
I'm starting with two nodes: elasticsearch_node_1 and elasticsearch_node_2.
When connecting node_1 to node_2 works great I can just ping elasticsearch_node_1 using it's container name:
elasticsearch_node_2$ ping elasticsearch_node_1
but doing
elasticsearch_node_2$ ping elasticsearch_node_2
gives an error, it can't resolve the hostname.
Is this a known issue or am I doing some thing wrong?
