I restarted and forgot to launch Docker for Windows before running docker-compose:
C:\Code\kuma>docker-compose pull
Pulling redis (redis:latest)...
ERROR: Windows named pipe error: The system cannot find the file specified. (code: 2)
It'd be nice to have a more informative error message about what file can't be found.
