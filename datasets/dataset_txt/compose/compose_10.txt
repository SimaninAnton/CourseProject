Expected behavior
docker-compose.exe behaves as it did in Docker Desktop for Windows 2.1.0.5.
Actual behavior
If terminal code page is UTF-8, docker-compose exec fails with LookupError: unknown encoding: cp65001
If .env file contains any entries, docker-compose exec fails with TypeError: environment can only contain strings
Information
Windows Version: Windows 10 Pro, build 18363.592
Docker Desktop Version: 2.2.0.0
Are you running inside a virtualized Windows e.g. on a cloud server or on a mac VM: No
The bundled docker-compose.exe appears to have been compiled using Python 2.7 and an older version of python-dotenv.
The issue can be worked around by installing docker-compose via pip and Python 3
Steps to reproduce the behavior
Add docker-compose.yml:
 version: "3"
 services:
   test:
     image: ubuntu
     command: tail -f /dev/null
Add .env:
 A=
In powershell, run:
 $OutputEncoding = `
   [Console]::OutputEncoding = `
   [Console]::InputEncoding = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8
 chcp.com 65001
 docker-compose down
 docker-compose up -d test
 docker-compose exec test echo 1
Observe unexpected error:
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "logging\__init__.py", line 879, in emit

Switch codepage to Windows 1252 and try again:
 $OutputEncoding = `
   [Console]::OutputEncoding = `
   [Console]::InputEncoding = [Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(1252)
 chcp 1252
 docker-compose exec test echo 1
Observe error:

Remove .env and try again:
 rm .env

 docker-compose up -d test
 docker-compose exec test echo 1
