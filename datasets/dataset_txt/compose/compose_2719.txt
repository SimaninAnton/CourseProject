We've been warning when a boolean value is used in these fields because things like y, yes, on, off, are all converted to True, which is often not the intent of the user.
The warning says we're going to make it an error in the next release, so we should do that.
I think our options are:
make it an error
violate the yaml spec, and only accept True, and False as booleans, and treat everything else as a string.
