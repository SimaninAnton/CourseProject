Note: this might be a 1.13 regression, since I don't remember seeing it with 1.12.
What I do:
I have a simple Compose file with two NGINX servers.
cat >docker-compose.yml <<EOF
www1:
  image: nginx
www2:
  image: nginx
EOF
I start them.
docker-compose up -d
What I expect to see:
The radiant beauty of the first-class, Python-powered, terminal-aware, ANSI-enlightened CLI which makes Compose a perpetual joy and delight to use and brings happiness to my darkest hours, i.e.:
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating tmp_www1_1 ... done
Creating tmp_www2_1 ... done
Starting tmp_www1_1 ... done
Starting tmp_www2_1 ... done
What I see instead:
Stuff gets slightly glitchy, i.e.:
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating tmp_www2_1 ... 
Creating tmp_www1_1 ... 
Creating tmp_www2_1
Creating tmp_www1_1 ... done
Additional notes:
While up is playfully humoring me, down won't let me, ahem, down, if I may intend the pun:
$ docker-compose down
Stopping tmp_www1_1 ... done
Stopping tmp_www2_1 ... done
Removing tmp_www1_1 ... done
Removing tmp_www2_1 ... done
It appears that scale took sides with up:
$ docker-compose scale www1=2
Starting tmp_www1_1 ... done
Creating tmp_www1_2 ... 
Creating tmp_www1_2 ... done
Is this an important issue?
I don't know! What is important? Is the breeze that blows through the bubbles of dew on morning leaves of blue mint important? In the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal, but I know that my Compose fellows are perfectionists, and that they shan't have any of this.
In all seriousness, though: I'm so used to Compose embodying the eternal jewel of software perfection, that when I saw this, I thought my containers had been lost at sea. So I think it's fix-worthy.
