Please add an option in fig.yml to mount the working directory like with docker run -w /path/to/workdir <image> <command>, which is also specified in a Dockerfile with:
WORKDIR /path/to/workdir
Something like this in fig.yml:
web:
  - image: my-image
  - command: my-command
  - workdir: /path/on/container
