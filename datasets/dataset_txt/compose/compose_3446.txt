Hello,
I have the following container configuration:
foodata:
    image: data-volume
    volumes:
        - /var/lib/foo
    comand: true
foobackup:
    image: data-volume
    volumes_from:
        - foodata:ro
When I run "docker-compose up", it returns the following error:
Service "foo-backup" mounts volumes from "foo-data:ro", which is not the name of a service or container.
It looks to me like docker-compose does not understand suffixes in "volumes-from", even though they have been supported in docker itself for a long time. For what it's worth, it appears that the "volumes" command does support suffixes.
