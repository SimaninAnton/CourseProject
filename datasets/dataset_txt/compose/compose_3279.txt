Running an image with an external data container. If I create a new volume (eg. postgis_store_7), and change the docker-compose.yml, the compose still runs the postgis_store_6 volume. To get it to reflect changes, I have to delete postgis_store_6 AND the container that used it (dev_postgis_1). Only then will it start using the configured postgis_store_7. No errors thrown.
From docker-compose.yml:
postgis:
  image: systemapic/postgis
  ports:
    - 5432
  volumes_from:
    - postgis_store_6
  command: ./start.sh
Docker version 1.8.2, build 0a8c2e3
docker-compose 1.2.0 and 1.4.1 (both)
