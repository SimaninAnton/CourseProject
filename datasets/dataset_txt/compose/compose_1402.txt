I create a virtual env with requests 2.11.1 installed and activate it:
$ which python
/home/gg/libra/venv/bin/python
$ which docker-compose
/home/gg/libra/venv/bin/docker-compose
but it still use packages in /usr/local/bin. The requests pkg is old:
$ docker-compose up
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose", line 7, in
from compose.cli.main import main
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/compose/cli/main.py", line 17, in
from . import errors
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/compose/cli/errors.py", line 15, in
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import ReadTimeoutError
ImportError: cannot import name ReadTimeoutError
How can I fix this?
