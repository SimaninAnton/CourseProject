In the current Docker CLI (as of 1.9) there are at least 4 ways of specifying a port mapping for -p
containerPort
hostPort:containerPort
hostIP:hostPort:containerPort
hostIP::containerPort
As Compose is looking to make some incompatible changes in the v2 format I would like to propose that we move away from using the string and to instead use a hash/dictionary
v1
ports:
  - "80"
  - "8080:80"
  - "192.168.99.100:8080:80"
  - "192.168.99.100::80"
Proposed v2**
ports:
  - container_port: 80

  - host_port: 8080
    container_port: 80

  - host_ip: "192.168.99.100"
    host_port: 8080
    container_port: 80

  - host_ip: "192.168.99.100"
    container_port: 80
The new format should be:
Easier to read
Easier to validate as the port numbers are int rather than string and there are no separators to deal with
Easier to document - we replace 4 different string formats with 3 keys
container_port is required, all other fields are optional
host_port defines a specific port on the host
host_ip specifies which IP address a port should bind to (default 0.0.0.0)
