(If there are priorities, this issue could be set to low)
I don't believe that this:
#4232
networks being attachable are enabled version 2.1+
is mentioned in the documentation.
See:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#network-configuration-reference
https://docs.docker.com/compose/faq/
Could this be added, or is it expected to search for features within the changelogs?
I'd say a blurb / footnote under https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#network-configuration-reference is good enough
From changelog: Networks created by Compose are now always made attachable (Compose files v2.1 and up).
