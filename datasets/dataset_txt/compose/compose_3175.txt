Hi
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.9.0-rc2, build 60d36f7
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version: 1.5.0rc1
$ docker-compose up -d feTestsWatch
$ docker-compose logs feTestsWatch
(...)

It worked with docker 1.7 and docker-compose 1.4:
$ docker-compose up -d feTestsWatch
$ docker-compose logs feTestsWatch
(...)
feTestsWatch_1 | chrome 43 (1/0/0) 
feTestsWatch_1 | [16:26:33] Finished 'wct:local' after 29 s
feTestsWatch_1 | [16:26:33] Starting 'test:local'...
feTestsWatch_1 | [16:26:33] Finished 'test:local' after 36 μs
I think the problem is in the character μ:
feTestsWatch_1 | [16:26:33] Finished 'test:local' after 36 μs
Thanks
