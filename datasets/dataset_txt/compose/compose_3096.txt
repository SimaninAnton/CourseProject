Currently I can do interactive debugging with
docker-compose run --service-ports web
This is as described in issue #359 . But over time I end up with many containers, as run creates a new one each time.
I would like something like:
docker-compose start --bind web
Something to start all the containers, but be able to do interactive debugging of a specific one.
I'm using pry
