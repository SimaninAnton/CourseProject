Great experience on a mac running boot2docker and fig, managing my project docker containers! Experience on windows hasn't been great...can load boot2docker, run the different docker containers individually but havent found a solution to getting fig installed! Our project supports different OS and it would be nice to a nice windows experience for developers.
Any links or custom ISO's with fig installed would be great.
