Test:
# in terminal 1, run a service like a database
docker run --rm --name first postgres

# in terminal 2
cat <<EOF > docker-compose.yml
second:
  image: busybox
  external_links:
   - first:uno
EOF
docker-compose run --rm second /bin/sh
Which will give you a BusyBox shell, and env shows the UNO_* env vars.
However, change the YAML to the following VALID YAML (e.g. try this linter or this one), and it will not work with docker-compose 1.5.1 (via DockerToolbox-1.9.1a.pkg).
second:
  image: busybox
  external_links: {first: uno}
