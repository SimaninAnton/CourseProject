I get a circular reference when I use the pattern below, which I believe should work.
docker-compose.yml
one:
    extends:
        file: another.yml
        service: two
another.yml
two:
    image: ubuntu:latest
    extends:
        file: another.yml
        service: three

three:
    user: blah
May be the same root cause #1343, but the behaviour is slightly different.
