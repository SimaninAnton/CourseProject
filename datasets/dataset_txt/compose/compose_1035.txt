Some weird stuff is happening here. In my GitLab CI config file I have:
    - docker pull "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest" || true
    - docker build --cache-from "$BACKEND_IMAGE_LATEST" --pull -t "$BACKEND_IMAGE_LATEST" backend
    - docker push "$BACKEND_IMAGE_LATEST"
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml run backend flake8
And docker-compose.ci.yml states:
version: '3.2'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: backend
      cache_from:
        - ${BACKEND_IMAGE_LATEST}
Full log of the CI pipeline runner is here - https://pastebin.com/VYiWxrxa
Till line 89 it sets up the runner container
Till 167 - download BACKEND_IMAGE_LATEST layers
Till 263 does some other preparations
At 264 starts to build new docker image using downloaded cached layers
Interesting part here is lines 289-294:
Step 5/13 : WORKDIR /code
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 07b675dda7f7
Step 6/13 : COPY requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt /code/
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 2c9e98a4eefa
It uses the cached layer.
5. Then it proceeds with the next steps and uploads them to the remote registry till the line 365 where it first time calls docker-compose.
6. At first, docker-compose uses caches too, but from the sixth step - refuses to do so!
Step 5/13 : WORKDIR /code
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 07b675dda7f7
Step 6/13 : COPY requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt /code/
 ---> 6989f138d57f
Step 7/13 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt     && pip install -r dev-requirements.txt     && python -m nltk.downloader -d /usr/local/share/nltk_data punkt

Collecting git+https://github.com/rsennrich/Bleualign.git (from -r requirements.txt (line 22))
And spends the precious time to download and install everything from scratch.
Thanks for any info!
