It would have been a nice addition to the docker-compose port command if you would just get all exposed project ports without having to probe each individual service and "internal" port.
For the following docker-compose.yml file:
service1:
  ports:
    - "80"
    - "443"
service2:
  ports:
    - "1234"
The docker-compose port command with no arguments would return something like this:
service1:
  80:0.0.0.0:49201
  443:0.0.0.0:49202

service2:
  1234:0.0.0.0:49203
