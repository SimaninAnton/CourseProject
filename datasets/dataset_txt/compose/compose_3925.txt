Now that we have the possibility to run docker container on read-only filesystem with docker v1.5 It would be really cool to have it on docker-compose.yml format also.
That would be very useful in order to create immutable infrastructures.
compose.yml example format could follow the same format as privileged boolean flag:
nginx:
  image: nginx:1.7.9
  read_only: true
