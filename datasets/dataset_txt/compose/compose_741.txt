Description of the issue
docker-compose version 1.21.0 is not able to handle com.docker.compose.project labels set with an older version of docker-compose that contain - or _ in their container names.
Our deployment does the following:
// pull new images
$ docker-compose pull
// stop old containers
$ docker-compose rm -s -f
// replace docker-compose.yml
// start new containers
$ docker-compose up -d
Context
docker-compose version 1.21.0, build 5920eb0
Docker version 18.03.0-ce, build 0520e24
Steps to reproduce the issue
Deploy some containers with - or _ in their container names with docker-compose version 1.20
Change docker-compose to version 1.21
Try to restart the containers
Observed result
docker-compose does not recognize containers deployed with an older version.
It fails to stop already deployed containers and fails to start the new containers afterwards.
Expected result
docker-compose recognizes containers deployed with an old version and transparently rewrites existing com.docker.compose.project labels to the new format.
Stacktrace / full error message
$ docker-compose rm -s -f
No stopped containers
$ sudo -E docker-compose up -d

Creating container-name ... error

ERROR: for container-name  Cannot create container for service container-name: Conflict. The container name "/container-name" is already in use by container "e7dfd157fed12251ed21a70f8243d87baa6fb1e2768e872875c101d37cf99891". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
