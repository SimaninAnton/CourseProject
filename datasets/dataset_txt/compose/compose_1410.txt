Hi there! Ran into a bit of an issue with docker-compose 1.13.0, build 1719ceb. In my test the issue goes back to at least 1.11.0.
A script I'm running does docker-compose down, which results in an uncaught exception that ends with the line: "requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: Missing dependencies for SOCKS support.":
Traceback (most recent call last):

requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: Missing dependencies for SOCKS support.
I'm running through docker machine and nothing in the docker compose yaml even mentions socks.
The script that wraps the docker-compose does set ALL_PROXY, which I think may be causing requests or some other library to eagerly load socks support.
My recommendation would be to add requests[socks] to the setup.py and call it good.
