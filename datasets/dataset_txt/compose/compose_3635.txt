I found a problem with timezone when viewing logs with 'docker-compose logs'. I have added
volumes: - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
into docker-composy.yml as I found as best solution. This works. Date and time is right on both host and in the container. It's bad only when I am viewing logs with docker-compose logs and I didn't find anything to it on google. Just for timezone inside of containers which works fine for me.
