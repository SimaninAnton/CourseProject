The services defined in docker-compose.yml allow hyphens in their name, which means that the resulting containers can obtain the following names:
myproject_some-service_1
myproject_some-other-service_1
However, when it is attempted to use COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my-project instead of myproject, the names of the services do not change to the following:
my-project_some-service_1
my-project_some-other-service_1
The cause is this line in command.py:
 return re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]', '', name.lower())
I might be wrong, but there seems to be no reason for having inconsistent naming restrictions in different parts of the resulting container name. Could be go for this?
 return re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9-]', '', name.lower())
Some of my projects haveprettylongnamesanditbecomeshardtoreadthemwithouthyphens. this-could-be-improved.
