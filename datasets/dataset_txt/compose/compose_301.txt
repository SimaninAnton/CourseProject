Description of the issue
The progress percentage is going crazy, the numbers are increasing and nulled with absolutely no relation to the actual status, they are somehow also linked to one another.
Symptoms
(I could possibly attach a video that will show what happens, the download and extraction are working great, the progress display is the problematic part)
This is what happened several seconds after running the command:
Pulling basic_nfc          ... 
Pulling basic_hw           ... downloading (57.9%)
Pulling basic_bridge       ... downloading (57.9%)
Pulling basic_relays       ... 
Pulling basic_counters     ... waiting
Pulling basic_rfid         ... downloading (57.9%)
Pulling basic_zabbix-agent ... done
Pulling basic_mr           ... 
Pulling basic_ui           ... waiting
This was the status several minutes later:
Pulling basic_nfc          ... 
Pulling basic_hw           ... extracting (1.8%)
Pulling basic_bridge       ... extracting (1.8%)
Pulling basic_relays       ... 
Pulling basic_counters     ... done
Pulling basic_rfid         ... extracting (1.8%)
Pulling basic_zabbix-agent ... done
Pulling basic_mr           ... extracting (1.8%)
Pulling basic_ui           ... extracting (8.0%)
The numbers are just increasing and decreasing randomly and there's no progress bar.
Previously (Last time I remember) the numbers were meaningful and always increasing as it should be.
