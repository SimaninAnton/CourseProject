Hello guys,
I'm pretty new with Docker so, maybe I'm doing, something very basic, wrong here.
I'm executing
docker-compose up
over this compose file
services: db: image: postgres apache2: image: webdevops/apache:latest ports: - 8084:80 - 443:443 links: - db
The postgres image is the official and the composing process just get stuck, usually at this command:
AH00094: Command line: 'apache2 -D FOREGROUND -D APACHE_LOCK_DIR'
and never finish".
This is the output while it builds, from the start:
docker-compose up

There is any problem with my configuration? Or am I missing something?
