Reading the help by docker-compose -h will give us the option --project-directory PATH
docker-compose [-f ...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
--project-directory PATH Specify an alternate working directory
(default: the path of the compose file)
But I tried to call the below command and failed - I have ensured the file at ./mySubFolder/docker-compose.yml has already been created.
docker-compose --project-directory ./mySubFolder up
The error
Can't find a suitable configuration file in this directory or anyparent.
Are you in the right directory?
Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml
What I did wrong? How to pass the parameter properly?
