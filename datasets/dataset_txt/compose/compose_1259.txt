I want to create a data volumesrc to map to a directory /home/app in my container. The directory /home/app has data already and I should get a data volume src with same data as '/home/app'. But I was not lucky and I got an empty folder /home/app in my container. Below is volumes section in my docker-compose file:
volumes: - ./src:/home/app
Docker host is on MacOS and Docker version shows:

And I'm creating a Docker compose version 1
