Hello,
Here's a typical docker-compose file. I use is it both for building image (docker-compose build) and to run my tests (docker-compose run test ).
     version: '2'
     services:

       test : 
         links: 
           - web 

         cmd : "mvn clean verify"

      web: 
         image: my_repo/my_image:tag
         build: .
When I use the run command docker-compose try to build the image before running the test.
Is there anyway to force it to pull existing image instead of trying to build new one ?
