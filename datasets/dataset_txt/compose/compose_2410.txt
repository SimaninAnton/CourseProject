It is great to have variable substitution in compose file, but is that possible to have a pre-defined docker network as an variable in top level networks declaration?
e.g. this compose file doesn't work, this gives service using undefined network
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
     - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
     - .:/code
    networks:
      - ${front}

  redis:
    image: redis
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/var/lib/redis
    networks:
      - ${back}
volumes:
  redis-data:
    driver: local
networks:
  ${back}:
    driver: external
  ${front}:
    driver: external
