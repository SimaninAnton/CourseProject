Hello,
I found fig quite useful, however found a minor annoyance in the way it terminates the services.
Right now, doing fig stop <name> performs similar to docker kill and produces processes not to exit cleanly.
Short example:
memcached:
  image: luislavena/mini-memcached
  ports:
    - "11211"
Sending a simple fig stop memcached result in -1 as status:
$ fig ps
          Name               Command     State    Ports
-------------------------------------------------------
skeletonrails_memcached_1   /start.sh   Exit -1
Which is the same as plain docker kill.
Instead, if INT or TERM is issued, container stops gracefully (Exit 0):
$ docker kill --signal="INT" c935d8fe691a
c935d8fe691a

$ fig ps
          Name               Command     State    Ports
-------------------------------------------------------
skeletonrails_memcached_1   /start.sh   Exit 0
I'm worried that the forced termination might cause missing data due flushes or caching (not at least on the memcached container, but others)
Should this be tackled by fig or should I report this to Docker instead?
Thank you for your time and for creating such great utility!
