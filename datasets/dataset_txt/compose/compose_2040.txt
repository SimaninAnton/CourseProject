The following 4 entries in this issue are discussion about the essence of this issue.
The question then becomes: Should Compose perform a "rollback" when encountering that situation and remove the unstartable container immediately? And how do we detect / differentiate failing containers due to configuration errors versus containers failing for other reasons inherent to the application they are running?
Former title and description:
Failing to scale a service up results in stop/start actions failing
Given a simple compose file, with port forwarding, such as
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    image: qkrijger/hello-world-wiremock-server:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - 80:80
The port forwarding prohibits us from scaling the container.
We now have a happy flow:
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
But if we have tried to scale, this fails:
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose scale app=2 fails, as expected
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start fails, which is a bug
