my compose v2 file looks like this:
version: '2'
services:
 postgres:
  image: xxxx/postgres:9.4
  container_name: postgres_fullstack
  volumes:
   - ${POSTGRES_DATA_VOLUME}:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  ${POSTGRES_DATA_VOLUME}:
When executing compose up, i get the error below:
The Compose file '.\docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
volumes value Additional properties are not allowed ('${POSTGRES_DATA_VOLUME}' was unexpected)
What am i doing wrong? Is variable substitution in top level volumes not supported yet?
