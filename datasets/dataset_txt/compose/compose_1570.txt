I am using docker-compose like this:
version: "2"
services:
  3dominator:
    build: .
    image: 3dominator:0.1
    container_name: 3dominator
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
      DB_ENV: container
      DOCKERHOST: $${DOCKERHOST}
    ports:
      - "3004:3004"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
    links:
      - 3dominatordb
      - 3dominatores
     ...
     ...
I want to pass a variable DOCKERHOST from my linux environment to docker container environment.
How to do that?
