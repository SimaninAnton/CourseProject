Docker Engine is running in swarm mode. I manually created an overlay attachable network foo on the manager node:
> docker network create --driver overlay --attachable foo
> docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE

In the Docker Compose file I use:
networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: foo
Docker Compose services on the manager node start and attach to the network successfully.
Docker Compose services on the worker node cannot find the network:
> docker-compose up -d
WARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.

Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.

To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.

ERROR: Network foo declared as external, but could not be found. Please create the network manually using `docker network create foo` and try again.
Using docker run on the worker node, I can successfully attach a container to the overlay network:
> docker run --net foo bar
