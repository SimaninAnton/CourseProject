I made a terminal dashboard which is using docker-compose logs command to display logs of some services.
With the colorama.init() (compose/compose/cli/colors.py) introduced in version 1.10 for Windows terminal coloration, piped commands seem not being able to display colors.
NodeJS example
'use strict';
let spawn = require('child_process').spawn;

const CWD="YOUR_COMPOSE_PROJECT_DIR";

function appendToBox(data) {
  if (data instanceof Buffer) {
    data = data.toString();
  }
  data = data.replace(/\n$/, ''); // Avoid double new line
  console.log(data);
}


let tail = spawn(
  'docker-compose',
  ['logs', '--tail=1'],
  {cwd: CWD}
);

tail.stdout.on('data', appendToBox);
tail.stderr.on('data', appendToBox);
tail.on('exit', (code) => {
  appendToBox('child process exited with code ' + code);
});
Command line example
docker-compose logs --tail=1 | tee
Manual workaround
Comment the line colorama.init() in file /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/compose/cli/colors.py.
Tested on Archlinux, I suppose your install dir may eventually vary depending on your distribution.
Issue resolution
If colorama is for Windows only could it be possible to run the colorama.init() only with that OS context ?
