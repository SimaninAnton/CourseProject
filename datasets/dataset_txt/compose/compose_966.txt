I'm using the following config file (some parts were taken out for simplicity):
---
version: '2'
services:
  toolbox:
    environment:
      - "USER=${USER}"
    volumes:
      - "${HOME}/.toolbox:/home/${USER}/.toolbox"
I noticed this after updating docker-compose to 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
$ docker-compose config

services:
  toolbox:
    environment:
      USER: ''
    volumes:
    - /root/.toolbox:/home/.toolbox:rw
version: '2.0'
Previously, with version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb it was like expected:
$ docker-compose config
services:
  toolbox:
    environment:
      USER: myuser
    volumes:
    - /home/myuser/.toolbox:/home/myuser/.toolbox:rw
version: '2.0'
