Best iluustrated with a simple example:
My compose file docker-compose-test.yml:
---
version: '2'
networks:
  public:
services:
  test:
    image: alpine:3.3
    command: ["/bin/sleep", "60"]
    networks:
      public: {}
And then try to run create
% docker-compose -p test -f docker-compose-test.yml create test
Creating test_test_1
ERROR: network test_public not found
but a up works fine:
% docker-compose -p test -f docker-compose-test.yml up
Creating network "test_public" with the default driver
Creating test_test_1
Attaching to test_test_1
Version
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.7.0, build unknown
