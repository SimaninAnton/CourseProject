I used to run tests in docker by running one-off containers, but that is not possible in 1.3.
When i try i says
$ docker-compose run backend npm test
Conflict. The name "app_backend_run_1" is already in use by container e46cb8f520ad. You have to delete (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
Same commando that I used before.
I have tried running docker-compose up and also docker-compose migrate-to-labels
How do you run one-off containers, like the docs propose
