In ubuntu 16.04
Docker version 1.12.6, build 78d1802
Docker-compose version 1.11.1
I use the compose.yml file from https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/
$ docker exec -ti wordpress_wordpress_1 /bin/bash
$ ping db
It seems the wordpress can't not ping db.
But when I change the docker-compose version to 1.8, it works.
