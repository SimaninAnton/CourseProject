This is a terrible subject but I am not sure how to phrase it better.
I am using docker-compose, together with data-only containers.
This is my relevant part:
solr:
  image: some_solr
  volumes_from:
    - solr_data
solr_data:
  image: some_solr
  volumes:
    - /var/solr:/var/solr:z
My CI Server logs in, does a docker pull for all images, then runs docker-compose up.
I expected that all containers based on old images get deleted and recreated and everything is fine.
Instead I get a warning that now my external volumes aren't used any more.
I am now not sure,
Is the warning wrong?
Should this be better handled by docker-compose up so that masking won't happen
Should I declare some dependency between the two containers to avoid this
Should I rm the containers?
