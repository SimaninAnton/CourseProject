I'm not sure if this is possible, but I was trying to do something like the following:
app:
  image: nginx
  ports: 
    - "80:80"
  log_driver: "gelf"
  log_opt:
    gelf-address: "udp://logstash:12201"
  links:
    - logstash

logstash:
  image: logstash
  expose:
    - "12201/udp"  
Currently this won't work, I assume because the log driver tries to initialize before any linking is done?
