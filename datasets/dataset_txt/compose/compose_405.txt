I was playing with Docker Configs in docker-compose and was surprised that the file would not show up despite no display of any error. docker config ls helped find out what is going on:
# docker config ls
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Use "docker swarm init" or "docker swarm join" to connect this node to swarm and try again.
It would be nice, if docker-compose could detect lack of swarm mode and show a(n error or) warning that Docker Configs require swarm mode.
Thanks for your consideration!
