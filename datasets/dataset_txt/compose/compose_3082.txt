When you use docker-compose at swarm manager
The image is dynamic built like this
web:
  build: .
For the first time docker-compose up -d, it works fine, will schedule on one swarm node, but when you try to scale up to multiple nodes, it will fail due to can not find the dynamic image.
Here's the output
root@swarm-manager:/opt/compose#docker-compose scale web=2
Creating and starting 2 ... error

ERROR: for 2  Error: image library/tlccom_web:latest not found
