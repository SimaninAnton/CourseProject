dockerfile doc hasn't been updated with Compose File v2 format:
Using dockerfile together with image is not allowed. Attempting to do so results in an error.
This is wrong for v2 format, it does work:
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    image: redis
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: .
$ docker-compose config
networks: {}
services:
  test:
    build:
      context: /xxx
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: redis
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
