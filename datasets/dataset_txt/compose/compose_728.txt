I'm trying to run few projects that have services that expose same ports.
I have found the same unanswered question here.
When I try to run second project I get
Bind for 0.0.0.0:8000 failed: port is already allocated
First project is available at localhost and its subnet. I don't want it to be available on localhost.
How to do that?
$ docker -v
Docker version 18.03.0-ce, build 0520e24
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.17.0, build ac53b73
