Hi, I try to make compose file that deploy to swarm mode.
First, sorry for my English and
Second, my docker and compose versions are
docker : 1.3.0
docker-compose : 1.10.
I made a docker-compose file somthing like below.
version: "3"

services:
  redis:
    image: myrepo/redis:latest
    volumes:
      - /home/user/docker/discourse/redis:/var/lib/redis:Z

  web:
    image: myrepo/web:latest
    env_file: .env
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: test_overlay
I already make test_overlay network.
And after trying sudo docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.yml test I got Error response from daemon: network test_default not found
I think compose ignore the pre-exist network name and try to find {stack_name_default} network.
Am I missing something?
When I try to using bridge network and docker-compose up, it works fine.
