I'm using a docker-compose file containing this service definition:
  nginx:
    image: gitlab:4567/infradev/infradev-admin
    volumes:
      - "conf:/conf"
    environment:
      - INFRADEV_ADMIN_HOSTNAME=
    command: ["dockerize",
              "-timeout", "300s",
              "-wait", "http://webapp:8000",
              "-stdout", "/var/log/nginx/access.log", "-stderr", "/var/log/nginx/error.log",
              ".env/bin/python3.6", "manage.py", "docker-nginx-start"]
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
When I try to start it with docker-compose up, I get:
ERROR: for nginx  expected string or buffer
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())

    raise error_to_reraise
TypeError: expected string or buffer
No matter what I tried I couldn't get more details out of that traceback, or figure out how to get logs from the parallel execution or what it tried to do...
The thing is, I noticed that once I drop the ports section -- everything works just fine. Is this a known issue? How can I discover what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks in advance!
