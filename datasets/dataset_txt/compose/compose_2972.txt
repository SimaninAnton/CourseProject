Hello,
I have a simple docker-compose.yml
helloworld:
  build: .
I run
docker-compose run helloworld
The container run and exit, then I would like to delete this container.
I tried
docker-compose rm -f -v helloworld
but it's not working:
> docker-compose rm -f helloworld
No stopped containers
But the container is there:
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
a7776041eece        sample_helloworld   "/bin/sh -c 'echo \"He"   40 seconds ago      Exited (0) 40 seconds ago                       sample_helloworld_run_1
If I run the compose with docker-compose up, I can do docker-compose rm -f -v helloworld
I know I can do docker-compose run --rm helloworld but I would like to know if this behaviour is correct?
Thanks
