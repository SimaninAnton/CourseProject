Hi,
I just updated to docker 1.3 and fig 1.0 and one of my containers now fails to build with the following error:
Step 5 : ADD https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/serf/0.6.3_linux_amd64.zip serf.zip
Traceback (most recent call last):

The offending line on the Dockerfile is:
ADD https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/serf/0.6.3_linux_amd64.zip serf.zip
With docker 1.2 and fig 0.5.3 this was working perfectly and running a docker build with docker 1.3 also works.
