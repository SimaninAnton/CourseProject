I am using Docker 1.12 and Compose 1.8. I am trying to understand how to mount the volumes for an image to global volumes.
The purpose is to use Docker services and Docker bundle for deploying clusters.
This is the error that I got :
WARNING: Unsupported top level key 'volumes' - ignoring
WARNING: Unsupported key 'volumes' in services.momgodb - ignoring
