I've configured a syslog log driver for a container and now get an error whenever I try to run a command in that container:
$ cat docker-compose.yml 
foo:
    image: php:5.6.10-apache
    log_driver: "syslog"
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting test_foo_1
$ docker-compose run --rm foo ls
Error attaching: configured logging reader does not support reading
