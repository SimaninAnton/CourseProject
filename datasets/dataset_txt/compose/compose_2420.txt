Just noticed this today - external networks seem to add the invalid external_name key
source file:
version: '2'

networks:
  rabbitmq:
    external:
      name: rabbitmq_default

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '7000:8080'
    networks:
      - default
      - rabbitmq
result of docker-compose config
networks:
  rabbitmq:
    external:
      name: rabbitmq_default
    external_name: rabbitmq_default
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: /app
    networks:
      default: null
      rabbitmq: null
    ports:
    - 7000:8080
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
I also noticed the networks section of a service seems to be converted from an array to a dict. Dunno if thats bad or not - probably not great.
Ran this with the HEAD version (1.8.0dev) as well as 1.7.0
