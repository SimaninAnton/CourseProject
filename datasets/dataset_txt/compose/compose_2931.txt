I am trying to use docker-compose to control a remote docker host. I set the following environment variables on the client machine to use the docker remote-host:
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/vagrant/docker
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
export DOCKER_HOST=my-docker-vm.cloudapp.azure.com:2376
The docker CLI works just fine with the configuration & certificates, but the docker-compose CLI throws the following error:
vagrant@my-docker-vm:/vagrant$ docker-compose stop
