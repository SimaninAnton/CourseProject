I tried to use tty: true for an interactive container, but it simply doesn't work: it hangs. The ls is me trying to interact with the bash, but there's no reaction / response. I tried specifying stdin_open with both true and false in addition, neither changes anything.

I tried it on another machine with docker 17.12.0 (CE) and the same thing happens, it just gets stuck forever.
