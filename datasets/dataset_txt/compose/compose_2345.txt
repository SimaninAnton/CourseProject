This is close to issue 1012 and its likes.
I tried the below docker-compose.yml file
version: '2'
services:
  test_app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  mong\o:
    image: mongo
in which I intentionally had a slash in the mongo service name.
But the error message I got when I run docker-compose ps in the same directory was
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Invalid service name 'test_app' - only [a-zA-Z0-9\._\-] characters are allowed
wrongly referencing test_app instead of mong\o
My docker-compose version is: docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
