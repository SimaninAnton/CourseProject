Apparently there is no way to pull each configured image to update them to latest versions. I frequently do this because I deploy new versions of my apps by pushing new images to a private repository. Currently I have to run "docker pull" manually for each of them.
Could there be a command like:
fig pull [service]
(If there already is a command for this, I missed it while trying to grep the source code and read the docs.)
