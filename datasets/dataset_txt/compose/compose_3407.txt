I wanted to try out the log-driver and log-opt added in #1388 and #1665.
My docker-compose.yml looks like this:
web:
  image: flowerpot/goif
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  log_driver: "syslog"
  log_opt:
    address: "udp://syslog-server:514"
However, when I do docker-compose up I get the following error:
Failed to initialize logging driver: Unix syslog delivery error
Which is weird because this works:
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=udp://syslog-server:514 flowerpot/goif
Shouldn't that be equivalent?
