When updating a Docker service, the following option exists:
      --update-order string                Update order ("start-first"|"stop-first")
This can be used to create rolling update deployments, even if a service has just one replica.
I propose adding the following keys to the Docker Compose spec, which will allow for these updates to work with docker deploy -c.
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        order: start-first
I would be happy to contribute the needed code to docker/docker-ce if that's something we'd like to have in the spec.
