Hi,
It would be nice to have fig evaluate commands like this:
data:  
  volumes:
    - /var/logs/`hostname`:/logs
 environment:
   - json: `cat ~/docker/zookeeper/env.json`
PS: at the moment, i can't use fig as i run my container like this:
docker run -e json="$(cat ~/docker/zookeeper/env.json)"  -v /var/logs/`hostname`:/logs
