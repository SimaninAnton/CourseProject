When running multiple instances of service using docker-compose run in parallel, some containers fail to start started with an error:
ERROR: No such container: ebe351e9f48acc1cb4c58f16df3487294c0f7ee5e7632f846974e9197f864bdd
The repository with sample docker-compose.yml and reproduction steps is here: https://github.com/carbolymer/docker-compose-run-parallel-failure
Steps to reproduce
Clone the repository mentioned above
Start rsyslog service
docker-compose up -d rsyslog
Start stress test
./run.sh
Observe multiple error messages in the terminal. If the error messages are not present, try to increase I/O parameter of the stress application in docker-compose.yml.
File example_run.log contains example log from execution of run.sh where only 14 containers of 20 were started.
