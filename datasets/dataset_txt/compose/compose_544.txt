I'm new to this. Im using Ubuntu 16.04
When i run this command 'sudo sh run.sh kinetic' in /Autoware/docker/generic, after asking password Iam getting output like this
Use kinetic
Shared directory: /home/root/shared_dir
Unable to find image 'autoware-kinetic:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for autoware-kinetic, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
See 'docker run --help'.
What can be the possible reasons for this error and how can it be avoided? plz help me with this
