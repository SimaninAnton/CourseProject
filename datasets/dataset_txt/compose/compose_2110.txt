Docker version 1.12, Compose version 1.8.
See https://github.com/jmkgreen/docker-compose-test for simple test. Launch then exec into the running container.
Observe:
jamesg@virt-04:~/docker-compose-test$ docker exec -it dockercomposetest_debian_1 bash
root@b5ff7abaf0fd:/# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
192.168.0.2     bar
172.23.0.2      b5ff7abaf0fd
Notice how the host bar is added by the override file, however I expected to see both bar and foo as foo comes from the docker-compose.yml file. It appears that the override file for extra_hosts replaces the values already found at interpolation time rather than augments the values.
