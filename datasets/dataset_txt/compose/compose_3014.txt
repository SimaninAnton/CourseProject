Right now we have log_driver and log_opt. It'd be cleaner to have them both under a logging key:
logging:
  driver: syslog
  options:
    syslog-address: "tcp://192.168.0.42:123"
An additional advantage: overriding a service's logging option would be cleaner, as you only have to override a single key (you're never going to want to override log_driver but not log_opt, because options are driver-specific).
