Is there a reason that the docker/compose image on DockerHub does not have a latest tag?
I would love to be able to just do this:
$ docker run --rm -it docker/compose --version
Unable to find image 'docker/compose:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: manifest for docker/compose:latest not found.
See 'docker run --help'.
