For some reason I cannot forward port 25 when running container using Compose. I can forward all other ports in Compose. Forwarding port 25 works well in plain Docker.
yml:
mail:
    image: mymail
    ports:
        - 25:25
        - 465:465
        - 587:587
        - 993:993
        - 995:995
docker ps shows "25/tcp" when run using Compose and "0.0.0.0:25->25/tcp" when run using plain Docker.
