I use dockercloud-haproxy to load balance web (and db) and docker-compose version 1 as version 2 does not work.
Scaling is fine but does not work unless --force-recreate is used which recreates every service.
Recreation is not necessary except for the load balancer and wastes time, especially in the case of databases shutting down and restarting, linearly related to the number of scaled services.
Using docker-compose restart --force-recreate lb results in an error (unerstandably), while docker-compose restart lbpretends to restart the service but does not achieve the desired result. Why? It should resolve the problem hands down.
Of course, manipulating the dockercloud-haproxy-mechanisms (python code) will fix this, but the resolution should not be left to user code. docker-compose should resolve this issue.
Or am I overlooking something here?
