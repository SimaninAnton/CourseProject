Hey All,
Looking for some guidance now that I am attempting to remove links.
Trying to use compose to start both consul and vault. I am guessing the problem is my network configuration in the vault.hcl?
I am guessing I can get to consul with the address of vault_resource_consul_1:8500. Is that wrong?
My project is located in the vault_resource directory
Here's my compose file:
resource:
  build: .
  command: echo "foo"
  volumes:
    - .:/source
vault:
  build: ./vault
  ports:
    - 8200:8200
  volumes:
    - ./vault/config.hcl:/tmp/vault.hcl
  volumes_from:
    - consul
  command: "server -dev -config=/tmp/vault.hcl"
consul:
  image: voxxit/consul:latest
  ports:
    - 80:8500
  volumes:
    - ./consul/config.json:/tmp/consul.json
  command: "agent -config-file=/tmp/consul.json"
Dockerfile for vault:
FROM gliderlabs/alpine:3.2

ENV version 0.3.1

RUN apk --update add ca-certificates
RUN wget -P /tmp https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/${version}/vault_${version}_linux_amd64.zip
RUN cd /usr/local/bin && \
unzip /tmp/vault_${version}_linux_amd64.zip && \
chmod +x vault

EXPOSE 8200

ENTRYPOINT ["vault"]
CMD ["server", "-dev"]
config file for vault
backend "consul" {
  address = "vault_resource_consul_1:8500"
  advertise_addr = "http://vault_resource_consul_1:8300"
  scheme = "http"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}
