Hi there,
I am trying to link my app to a mongo db, this works fine if I mount the code however when building using the docker file they cannot talk to one another, here is my code, any help would be much appreciated:
version: '2'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:3.2
    container_name: mongodb

  app:
    build:
      context: .
    environment:
      - MONGODB_HOST=mongodb
      - MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongodb/db-test
      - PORT=80
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
I get an getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN mongodb:27017
Am I doing anything wrong?
