Trying to run compose on a fresh Windows 10 and Docker Toolbox install. Haven't customized or modified the environment, running in the msys based terminal that comes with toolbox.
I get the following error:
Warning: There is a boolean value, True in the 'environment' key.
Environment variables can only be strings.
Please add quotes to any boolean values to make them string (eg, 'True').
This warning will become an error in a future release.
My YAML files don't have booleans in them, so I'm not sure where it's finding this boolean value or where I should be changing it if it's something on my end.
