I'm trying to use the netshare volume plugin with a v2 docker compose file.
In netshare the volume name is the same as the network location to be mounted, e.g docker volume create -d cifs --name someserver.example.com/path/to/mount. When trying to set this name in compose using the following format I get an error message.
version: '2'

services:
  # Services are here

volumes:
  someserver.example.com/path/to/mount:
    driver: cifs
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
volumes value Additional properties are not allowed ('someserver.example.com/path/to/mount' was unexpected)
Am I doing something wrong?
