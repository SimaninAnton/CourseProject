Pull request #2204 documented the double-dollar sign ($$VARIABLE) escaping in the documentation, how about putting the same suggestion in the error message:
Change this:
WARNING: The VARIABLE variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
To this:
WARNING: The VARIALBE variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
         Did you forget to escape VARIABLE with two dollar signs like this: `$$VARIABLE`
         in your docker-compose.yml file?
Would make the error message much more useful and less misleading.
