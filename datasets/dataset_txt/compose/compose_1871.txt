Variable substitution doesn't seem to work correctly when there is a default value which itself contains curly braces. I saw the documentation stating that $$ can be used to escape $ but didn't see anything about escaping curly braces (doubling them up didn't seem to help). Steps to reproduce:
Create a docker-compose.yml with the following contents:
version: '2.1'

services:

  hello-world:
    image: hello-world:latest
    environment:
      - URL_TEMPLATE=${URL_TEMPLATE:-http://example.org/{urlTemplateVariable}/some-sub-directory}
docker-compose up then examine the environment variables of the container (e.g. docker inspect -f "{{ .Config.Env }}" test_hello-world_1).
Expected value of URL_TEMPLATE:
http://example.org/{urlTemplateVariable}/some-sub-directory
Actual value is:
http://example.org/{urlTemplateVariable/some-sub-directory}
This also seems to cause problems when trying to override the default value from a .env file. If you add a .env like so:
URL_TEMPLATE=http://example.net
The expected value of URL_TEMPLATE is:
http://example.net
Actual value is:
http://example.net/some-sub-directory}
