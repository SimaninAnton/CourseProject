I'm seeking a convenient workaround for #423 (comment) . I want to default to stdin_open and tty false so that I can use docker-compose logs, but I want and easy way to turn them for interactive debugging and to allow me to detach from containers.
$ docker-compose --version                   
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
# in .env
INTERACTIVE=false
# in docker-compose.yml
services:
  foo:
    stdin_open: ${INTERACTIVE}
    tty: ${INTERACTIVE}
$ INTERACTIVE=true docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file '/home/gabe/src/docker/docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.foo.stdin_open contains an invalid type, it should be a boolean
services.foo.tty contains an invalid type, it should be a boolean
