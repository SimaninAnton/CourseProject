I've noticed that docker-compose run seems to be significantly slower than plain docker run. Based on verbose logs it looks like it's slow due to docker resize command.
See example:

Additionally i'm not sure is that a problem with my specific terminal but i've noticed that docker-compose run does not start terminal prompt until I type something into it. In the gif you can see me typing pwd otherwise it just sits there without prompt forever.
