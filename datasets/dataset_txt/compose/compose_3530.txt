This one had me scratching my head for a bit. Apparently using --rm option for run commands will always return exit signal 1 even though the command did exit with 0.
To reproduce:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose 1.2.0
docker-compose.yml:
test:
    image: busybox
$ docker-compose run test true
$ echo $?
0
$ docker-compose run --rm test true
$ echo $?
1
Our build tools wrap docker-compose and rely on the exit signal to determine errors, so this is a bit of a show stopper.
