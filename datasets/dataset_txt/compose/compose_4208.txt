I'm trying to create a volume using an environment variable I previously set up in my Dockerfile. However when I ran the project, fig created a folder with the name of my environment variable, instead of assign its value. I put the code below:
web:
build: .
volumes:
- ${WORKSPACES_HOME}/logs:/webapp/myapp/logs/
I used to do it in docker with the next sintax:
docker run -v ${WORKSPACES_HOME}/logs:/webapp/myapp/logs
