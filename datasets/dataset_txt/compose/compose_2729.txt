I have a docker-compose.yml file with the following service defined:
version: "2.0"
services:
  database:
    image: oraclelinux:7
    command: /bin/bash
    shm_size: 1g
The service creation fails as the sum-size option is unavailable in docker compose. I use the following versions of the Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
Docker version 1.10.1, build 9e83765
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
