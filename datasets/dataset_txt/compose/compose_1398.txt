Currently, the download link is provided but the document doesn't mention any SHA sum. Could you please mention what the hash ought to be, going forward, so I have a frame of reference?
E.g., for https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.13.0/docker-compose-Linux-x86_64 I get 0d8af4d3336b0b41361c06ff213be5c42e2247beb746dbc597803e862af127e8, which appears to run.
