Description of the issue
Currently, the docker-compose -build command accumulates space on my computer's hard drive, in this case a MacBook Pro, causing Docker to take up a lot of space, leaving me quite frustrated. However, I know there are some commands for cleaning images, but it would be a lot easier if it were something automatic, something instant, when you stopped using Docker, so that it does not occupy the entire hard disk space.
Context information and solution alternative
The alternative I thought was to create a cronjob that every week, or every 3 days, the docker prune -a --volumes command is executed, causing the Docker image to be completely cleaned.
This can be extremely useful, taking into consideration that adding a cronjob to the docker could make the computer lighter and doesn't crash.
The alternative I thought was creating a cronjob that would make it easier to clean disk and Docker images, causing significant improvements in the software.
