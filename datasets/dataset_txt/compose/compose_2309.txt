It will be very useful to have a flag enabling setting hostname equal to container name.
Here is my case:
I am trying to launch rabbitmq cluster with scaling and overlay multihost network.
For successful cluster startup each node should be able to ping each other by hostname.
When I using compose scale - each node get id-based hostname, but this hostname is not resolvable by other nodes. And I can't find a way to get container name inside container, to set hostname during startup process.
something like
if ('hostname' not in container_options):
container_options['hostname'] = container_options['name']
in the _get_container_create_options helps me.
Or maybe any other, easier way?
