While performing
docker-compose ... build I was getting consistently errors:
chematica@deb01:/opt/sas/chematica/zmq$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.common.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml build
Building rabbitmq

IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device
docker-compose returned -1
On the root device indeed not much space was left but docker itself never complained for TMPDIR points to another device.
Turns out that docker-compose writes in my case a ~1GB tmp file to /tmp (ignoring TMPDIR variable) with filenames like:
tmpePRwRB
tmpjkvgDF
before proceeding with actual image building.
