When you set the port of a published port via an environment variable it is interpreted as a string.
Expected: The variable is interpreted as an integer.
# docker-compose build
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-stack.yml' is invalid because:
services.nginx.ports.published contains "8000", which is an invalid type, it should be an integer
# .env
PUBLIC_PORT=8080
DOCKER_REGISTRY=foobars
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.2"

services:
  nginx:
    image: '${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/nginx-proxy'
    ports:
      - target: 80
        published: ${PUBLIC_PORT}
        protocol: tcp
        mode: host
