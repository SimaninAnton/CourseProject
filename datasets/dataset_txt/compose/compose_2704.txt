build.args doc states:
Build arguments with only a key are resolved to their environment value on the machine Compose is running on.
It's the same feature as for environment.
However, it doesn't work with object syntax:
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        BLA:
$ BLA=foo docker-compose config
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s):
services.test.build.args contains null, which is an invalid type, it should be a string, or a number
It should work (and maybe it shouldn't not accept a number, I don't know).
Array syntax does work:
version: '2'
services:
  test2:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - BLA
$ BLA=foo docker-compose config
networks: {}
services:
  test2:
    build:
      args:
        BLA: foo
      context: /xxx
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
Also, build.args doc is missing example for these specific points. environment has nice examples for that.
