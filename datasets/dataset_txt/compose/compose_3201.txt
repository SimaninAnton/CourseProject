Let's say I have the following setup with the following links (excluding the rest of the keys for brevity):
something:
  links:
    - foobar:foobar

foobar:
  hostname: foobar
  domainname: foobar.example.com
On something, I can ping foobar as it's added to the hosts file, but foobar.example.com is not.
