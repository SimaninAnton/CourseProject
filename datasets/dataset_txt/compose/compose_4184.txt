Start Charles Proxy
Try to attach to a container
$ cat fig.yml
busybox:
image: busybox
$ fig run busybox /bin/sh
Fig then appears to freeze up, but attaching to the container with docker attach works fine, and any output generated as a result will appear in the fig output too. It looks like having Charles open is somehow causing fig to block stdin.
Here is a gist with the POST /containers/.../attach requests: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/acd7aa634ce668f1f93b
