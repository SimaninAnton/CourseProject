After I installed docker completely, then I tried to install docker-compose followed by the docs Install Docker Compose, after that when I run the command docker-compose , error:
docker@ubuntu:~$ docker-compose
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
My ubuntu's version info:
docker@ubuntu:~$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:51:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
I also tried on th CentOS 7 with the same error.
Any suggestions are appreciated.
I tried to use sudo pip install docker-compose and fixed.
