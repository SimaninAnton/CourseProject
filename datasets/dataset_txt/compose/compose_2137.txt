Hy,
I set SERVICE_NAME to "test".
Tried docker-compose up -d with the following compose file:
jenkins_${SERVICE_NAME}:
    image: jenkins
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
Following error appears:
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Invalid service name 'rbp_${USER}' - only [a-zA-Z0-9._-] characters are allowed
Is it possible to somehow create service dynamically, pass env_var to service name?
docker-compose version: docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 6c29830
Thanks in advance,
