my .env:
RETRIES=3
my docker-compose.yaml:
    healthcheck:
      test: nc -v -w 5 -z localhost ${AUTH_SERVER_PORT}
      interval: ${INTERVAL}
      timeout: ${TIMEOUT}
      retries: ${RETRIES}
when docker-compose config, it says:
retries contains an invalid type, it should be a number
how to solve this problem, thanks very much!
