Documentation states that from 2.1, start_period is supported in healthchecks, but it is not.
Source: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#healthcheck
This compose will fail with services.nginx.healthcheck value Additional properties are not allowed ('start_period' was unexpected):
version: '2.2'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "localhost"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 1
      start_period: 30s
Changing version to 2.1, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 yields the same error message.
