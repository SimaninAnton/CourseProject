Description of the issue
I got an error when trying to build my images using
docker-compose -f production.yml build
[20714] Failed to execute script docker-compose
I ran the build command on my machine several times today with success. I am not sure what has changed since the last successful build.
Restarting docker does not change anything. I found this issue: docker/docker-credential-helpers#82
A commenter suggested to uncheck and re-check the "Securely store Docker logins in macOS keychain" option in Docker -> Preferences -> General.
Doing this resolved the problem and allowed me to build my images. However this still seems to be a Bug so I am opening this Issue.
I was at no point prompted to enter a password or username. The Keychain has one docker-related entry for aws ecr access.
Here are two screenshots of the Keychain entry:

Please let me know if you need more information or if this should be addressed at a different location.
