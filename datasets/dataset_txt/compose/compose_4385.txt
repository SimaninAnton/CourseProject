If one scales down an app, containers will be stopped in order to achive that.
If one restarts everything, the app starts all existing containers, and therefore the downscaling has no effect. At least is doesn't survive a restart, whereas an upscaling a restart survives.
Suggestion:
The scaling function should not only stop the containers, but also remove them.
