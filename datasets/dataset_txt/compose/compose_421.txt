The default naming scheme for containers created by Compose in this version
has changed from <project>_<service>_<index> to
<project>_<service>_<index>_<slug>
Is there any way to disable this behavior apart from using container_name in yaml file?
We have many scripts that rely on container names and are not using swarm, just a single container stack. This change is very inconvenient for us.
