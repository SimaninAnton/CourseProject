I'm writing a tool that uses docker-compose and it needs to tell the user whether they need to 'up' a service. To do this, I have reproduced the config-hash so I can check if the config has been changed, but the method of doing this changes between docker-compose versions, so it would be handy to be able to ask docker-compose whether it thinks the config has changed directly, without performing any other actions.
