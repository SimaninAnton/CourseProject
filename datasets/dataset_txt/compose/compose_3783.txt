Hi,
I am trying to create a container using docker-compose 1.1.0 and this case looks like it is not using the environment variable:
File docker-compose-mysql.yml
mysql:
  image: mysql
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:password
Run it:
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yml up
Recreating compose_mysql_1...
Attaching to compose_mysql_1
mysql_1 | error: database is uninitialized and MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD not set
mysql_1 |   Did you forget to add -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=... ?
compose_mysql_1 exited with code 1
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Any ideas ?
