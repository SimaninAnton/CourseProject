If I create an empty docker-compose.override.yml in a project, docker-compose up throws the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
We should instead show the same Top level object needs to be a dictionary error that you get if your docker-compose.yml file is empty.
