I have one question regarding adding service to existing container. How can I add a new service to my existing container without having to kill the currently running services? Here is what I have in my yaml:
postgis_native:
  image: mdillon/postgis:9.4
  container_name: postgis_native
  restart: always
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1FMp0stg1s
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes:
    - /srv/postgis_native/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

postgis_eGDB_100:
  image: mdillon/postgis:9.4
  container_name: postgis_eGDB_100
  restart: always
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1FMp0stg1s
  ports:
    - "5433:5432"
  volumes:
    - /srv/postgis_eGDB_100/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
and I want to add a different service to this file and start up that service. When I issue the docker-compose up, I get an error saying
ERROR: Conflict. The name "postgis_native" is already in use by container 19c82d5ecbf7.
You have to delete (or rename) that container to be able to reuse
My problem is that I cannot stop any of my current services.
Thank you!
