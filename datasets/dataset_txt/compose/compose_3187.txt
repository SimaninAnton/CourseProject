EX: docker-compose up -var POSTGRES_VERSION=9.3
Because many people using docker-compose to setup many applications at the same server.
If there are two applications I have to using the same image with different tag. But variable only can read from shell environment. I cannot set POSTGRES_VERSION=9.3 and POSTGRES_VERSION=9.4 at the same time. If it can read from stdin will be more flexible.
Variable priority:
From stdin
From shell environment
Default value inside yaml file.
Default empty string value (empty string)
