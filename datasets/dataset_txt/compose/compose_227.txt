Description of the issue
Usually, every resource created by Docker Compose contains com.docker.compose.project label. But when compose creates a network, it is not labeled.
Context information (for bug reports)
Testcontainers' users report a lot of unused, prunnable networks:
testcontainers/testcontainers-java#955
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a Docker Compose file with a network
Start it
Inspect the created network, see "Labels": {}
Observed result
Networks are not labeled
Expected result
Networks (as well as any other Docker resource created by Docker Compose) should have a consistent com.docker.compose.project label set
