On docker-compose 1.19.0rc2, the DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY variable does not seem to be taken into account anymore.
Environment:
Docker 17.09.0-ce with TLS support enabled
docker-compose.yml as follows:
version: '2'

services:
  dev:
    image: "whatever-image-you-want"
And launch
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://x.x.x.x:2376
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certs
docker-compose up -d
With docker-compose 1.18.0, no warning and container is up
vagrant@stretch:~$ docker-compose --tlsverify up -d dev
Starting vagrant_dev_1 ... done
With docker-compose 1.19.0-rc2, a lot of warnings appears
vagrant@stretch:~$ docker-compose up -d dev

vagrant_dev_1 is up-to-date
But if I launch docker-compose --tls-verify up -d, no warning appears.
So maybe a glitch with DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable in 1.19?
