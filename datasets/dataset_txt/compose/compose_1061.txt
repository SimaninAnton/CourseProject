Hello,
I ahve the following yaml file:
version: "2"
services:
  db:
    image: oracle/database:11.2.0.2-xe
    volumes:
      - ./oraxe/customization:/u01/app/oracle/scripts/startup
    container_name: oraxe
    shm_size: 1g
    ports:
      - 1521:1521
      - 80:8080
    environment:
      ORACLE_PWD: California1

  wfy10:
    build:
      context: ./wfy10
    image: wfy10_oracle
    container_name: wfy10
    entrypoint: /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9990:9990
    links:
      - db:db
    depends_on:
     - "db"
It starts a container running an Oracle XE database image and then another one running a Wildfly appserver, dependent of the first one. The appserver needs customizations and, a part of these customizations, depend of the status of the first container. For example, defining JDBC connections to the database requires that the database container be started.
For some reason, the database container needs almost 3 minutes to start. My understanding was that the "links" and "depends_on" statements are used to synchronize the containers strat-up and I was expected that, given that the wildfly container depends on the oracle one, it doesn't execute its customizations until the oracle one is started. The customizations are executed as a script with RUN in the Dockerfile.
But what seems to happen is that the Dockerfile for the wildfly container executes the customization script before the oracle container completely started-up and, hence, this customization script fails. Currently, I'm running the "docker-compose -up" command and when it finishes, I have the wildfly container started and the oracle container in the "starting" status. Almost three minutes later, the oracle container is started as well and only then I could execute the customizations.
How could I do this ?
Many thanks in advance,
Nicolas DUMINIL
