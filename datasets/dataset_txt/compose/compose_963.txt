From the v1.10.1 release notes, one of the notes is "Fixed a bug where Compose would occasionally crash while streaming logs when containers would stop or restart".
Can you please post the initial issue that has more details about this bug, or elaborate on it here? Sorry if this is discoverable somewhere - I searched the past issues in this repo and looked at the code diff for that version before posting here.
I'm running docker-compose 1.9.0 and think that I may be seeing this issue. I get an exception with the below traceback unpredictably about once per day:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Thank you!
