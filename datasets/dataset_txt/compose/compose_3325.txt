There are added 3 dots after the container name when doing up
# docker-compose up
Starting dockercomposetest_helloworld_1...
Attaching to dockercomposetest_helloworld_1
which makes copy/pasing the name on Linux slow, as you can't just double click on the name without also getting the 3 dots. So one would have to drag the mouse cursor over the name and make sure not to get any of the dots included.
Proposal
Don't add the 3 dots.
