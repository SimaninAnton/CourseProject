Compose pull parallel limited to only 5 at a time
Version 1.23.0+
It use to be much faster but it looks like when you guys added that compose build to have a --parallel flag you also limited pull to 5 at a time as well. Can we remove that limit on pull to be what it was before or can we add a new flag to set how many can run in parallel?
