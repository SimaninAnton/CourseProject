I'm using docker from development to production and while developing I find annoying the need to prepend docker-compose run --rm SOME-CONTAINER PUT-YOU-FAVORITE-TOOL-HERE arg1 arg2.
For instance, image you're working in a ruby project, you'll run docker-compose run ruby-container --rm rake some-task at least a dozen times a day. The way I'm solving this right now is creating a binstub under ./bin/rake and adding .binto my PATH.
The binstub is a simple delegate to a new container run implemented like so: docker-compose run --rm ruby-container rake $@.
My proposal is to add a new key to docker-compose.yml, like so:
ruby:
  image: ruby
  binstubs:
    - rake
    - rails
    - some-other-random-executable
And then (maybe) in the build process actually generate these binstubs.
Let me know if this makes sense for you, of if you've solved this in any other way.
Thank you,
