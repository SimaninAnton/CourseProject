Hi,
I just discovered, that the URL stated in many installation instructions (https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/) is not available, a 404 Page not Found Error is returned.
This URL is mentioned on the following pages:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases
Regards
