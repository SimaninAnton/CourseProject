Description of the issue
There is an inconsistent behaviour between my current installed and a newer docker-compose version when using defined environment variables inside of an .env file.
Context information (for bug reports)
Here is the sample .env file i used.
SERVICE_NAME=foo
DOMAIN_NAME=docker.com
VIRTUAL_HOST=${SERVICE_NAME}.${DOMAIN_NAME}

Output of docker-compose config (current version)
    ...
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: ${SERVICE_NAME}.${DOMAIN_NAME}
    ...
Output of docker-compose config (new version)
    ...
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: $${SERVICE_NAME}.$${DOMAIN_NAME}
    ...
Steps to reproduce the issue
run docker-compose config with the .env file.
Observed result
run docker-compose config with the .env file.
The older docker-compose version creates a docker-compose.yml file with the following, desired content: VIRTUAL_HOST: foo.docker.com. The newer version instead outputs the following environment variable: VIRTUAL_HOST: $${SERVICE_NAME}.$${DOMAIN_NAME}
Expected result
docker-compose config should create resolve the variable.
