Description
The config command in Docker Compose 1.9.0 and 1.10.0-rc1 produces incorrect output for depends_on when the Compose file version is 3.0. In Compose file version 2.1, the depends_on property gained the ability to specify that dependencies wait on positive healthchecks. This feature is not part of file version 3.0.
However, when docker-compose config is called with version 3.0 files as input, it outputs version 2.1 style depends_on, which then doesn't work with docker stack deploy --compose-file in Docker 1.13.
I use docker-compose config to produce a single Docker Compose file from multiple files before passing it to docker stack deploy --compose-file.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Create a Docker Compose file with the version set to 3.0 and a service that has a depends_on with a list of other services that it depends on.
Run docker-compose config.
Describe the results you received:
In the output of the config command, depends_on should remain a list of services.
Describe the results you expected:
In the output of the config command, depends_on has been converted to version 2.1 format. It is now a mapping, with condition: service_started added to each service.
Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):
Tried with both Docker Compose 1.9.0 and 1.10.0-rc1. Same result.
Here's an example.
Input Docker Compose file:
version: '3'

services:
  converis:
    image: docker.ucalgary.ca/tr/converis
    depends_on:
      - converis-db

  converis-db:
    image: docker.ucalgary.ca/rms/converis-db-configs
Output of docker-compose config:
networks: {}
services:
  converis:
    depends_on:
      converis-db:
        condition: service_started
    image: docker.ucalgary.ca/tr/converis
  converis-db:
    image: docker.ucalgary.ca/rms/converis-db-configs
version: '3.0'
volumes: {}
