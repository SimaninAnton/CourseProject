When I tried running fig on start up using upstart on Ubuntu, I got some very cryptic error.
Here is my /etc/init/fig.conf:
description "fig"
start on filesystem and started docker
stop on runlevel [!2345]
respawn
chdir /opt/containers
script
    exec /usr/local/bin/fig up
end script
This is the error I got:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>

After hours of fiddling, I decided to re-installed fig using pip, and the error finally became clear:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/fig", line 9, in <module>

Basically, fig is expecting HOME environment variable to be set, and upstart does not have that. So adding export HOME=/root to the script section of the init config fixes this issue.
description "fig"
start on filesystem and started docker
stop on runlevel [!2345]
respawn
chdir /opt/containers
script
    export HOME="/root"
    exec /usr/local/bin/fig up
end script
This is not really a bug. I am simply putting it here to save other people's time.
