Description of the issue
The following configuration produces an error from docker-compose:
version: '3'
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
    - /tmp/foo:/tmp/foo
    - /tmp/foo:/tmp/foo
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.webserver.volumes value ['/tmp/foo:/tmp/foo', '/tmp/foo:/tmp/foo'] has non-unique elements
However, the following variants do not:
version: '3'
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
    - /tmp/foo:/tmp/foo
    - /tmp/foo:/tmp/foo:rw
version: '3'
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
    - /x:/y
    - /z:/y
Whilst it's easy to spot in simple cases like this, we've been tripped up by this in large configurations, where we assume docker-compose config would error on invalid configurations.
