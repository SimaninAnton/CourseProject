I am using docker-compose to start nanoserver dotnet core containers in Windows Server 2016. Not in swarm mode, as we don't have 1709 update yet. I need to read some passwords from environment variables in staging and production. One of them contains pound symbol "£". All other environment variables such as connection strings, etc. work fine, however, I am getting the "Invalid interpolation format for "environment" option" error. It works as intended when I delete that environment variable from the compose file, or change the variable, so I know this is the only one that causes problem.
I am assuming this is an encoding problem. Is there a way to change the encoding for docker compose or containers? Or should I devise a work around? Or do i somehow need to escape this?
Expected behavior
excerpt of compose file with the problems:
  emailservice:
    image: emailservice
    build:
      context: ./EmailService/EmailService
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      "SMTPSettings__Username": "$EmailService_SMTPSettings_Username"
      "SMTPSettings__Password": "$EmailService_SMTPSettings_Password"
      "ConnectionStrings__SqlDb": "$SqlConnectionStrings"`
where
$EmailService_SMTPSettings_Password = "some£password"
When i call
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
the containers should start
Actual behavior
Invalid interpolation format for "environment" option in docker-compose
