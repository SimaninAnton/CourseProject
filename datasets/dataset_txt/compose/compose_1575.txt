Having a docker-compose.yml file with volumes in it, when executing:
docker-compose config > updated-compose.yml
Then:
    volumes:
    - ./host_volume:/container_volume:rw
is converted into:
    volumes:
    - /Users/myuser/path/to/project/host_volume:/container_volume:rw
I'd expect preserving the relative paths in that case.
I believe the problem is here: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/config/config.py#L1032
Thanks!
