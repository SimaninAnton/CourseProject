please refer docker documentation here https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/
it says that
If you restart the source container, the linked containers /etc/hosts files will be automatically updated with the source container's new IP address, allowing linked communication to continue.
When I using fig links new IP address of source container is not reflecting in linked container.
$ sudo fig --version fig 1.0.1
$sudo docker --version Docker version 1.5.0, build a8a31ef
