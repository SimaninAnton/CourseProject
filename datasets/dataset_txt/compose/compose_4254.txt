If I've got a project that has many services, and then I log into one of them (using SSH or nsenter) and I kill the process specified in CMD, that server shuts down (I guess no way around that if the service is PID 1) but so do all the other services in the project.
It would be helpful during development and testing to be able to kill one servie and see how the other services cope with it (for example killing db_1 in order to see how web_1 deals with the failure of its database). Since docker makes modelling an entire staging/production infrastructure on your development machine so easy, the process of killing/restarting services to test things is now possible to do. And if fig would support this use case it would provide useful insight into the behaviour of the application as a whole.
Is there a way to stop one service's container but leave all the others running? It would be quite useful during development and testing. Because otherwise I think the only way to do this would be to start up the containers manually (outside of fig, using only docker commands). This would mean duplicating the entire fig.yml in command-line arguments to docker, which would be tedious and error-prone.
Maybe an argument like --no-auto-shutdown to fig up or something would help with this? Along with some kind of fig up db so that after shutting down db_1 we could start it back up again and see how web_1 deals with it becoming available again.
