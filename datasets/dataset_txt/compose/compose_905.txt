Hi there,
Since updating to 17.12.0-ce, on windows I am experiencing and issue with my host volumes where the do not get mounted to my container anymore, this issue is not present when i try 17.12.0 on ubuntu 16.04
running compose version: "2"
My volumes are defined as
volumes:
- ./:/var/www
- ./docker/logs:/var/log/apache2
- ./docker/shared:/shared
- ~/.composer:/home/coder/.composer
- /var/www/config/sync
- my-files-volume:/var/www/web/sites/default/files
- ./docker/provision/config/settings.local.php:/var/www/web/sites/default/settings.local.php
However since updating, the contents of my root directory, and others, is not mounted to my container, and 'settings.local.php' is created as a folder/directory within my container and not copied accross.
This issue does not happen when using 17.12 on Ubuntu.
Cheers
