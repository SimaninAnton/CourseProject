Good day.
Sample case:
docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
    echo:
        image: alpine
        entrypoint: [echo]
        command: ['Hello, world!']

   hello-world:
       extends:
           service: echo
docker-compose.prod.yml
version: '2'

services:
   echo:
      command: ['Not so friendly']
Outputs for hello-world:
docker-compose up hello-world
Hello, world!
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up hello-world
Hello, world! (Not so friendly was expected)
While outputs for docker-compose up echo are ok
