Setup:
serviceA:
image: serviceA:1.0.1
command: --switch-that-fails=1
serviceB:
image: serviceB:1.0.2
links:
- serviceA:serviceA
The way it is now (docker compose 1.4.2):
docker_compose up
the entrypoint script for serviceA image fails
serviceB container starts up anyway
the link hostname inside serviceB for "serviceA" is not set: "serviceA hostname not known"
serviceB container is up, but producing confusing errors
The way it should be:
docker_compose up
the entrypoint script for serviceA image fails
serviceB does not start, or immediately shuts down
