I am running Debian 9 host and using Docker version 17.09.1-ce, build 19e2cf6 and docker-compose version 1.17.0, build ac53b73. This is the content of my docker-compose.yml
 version: '3'

 services:
    product-service:
        build: ./product
        volumes:
            - ./product:/user/src/app
        ports:
            - 5001:80
And here is product/Dockerfile
FROM python:3-onbuild
COPY . /usr/src/app
CMD ["python", "api.py"]
I build and run this container with docker-compose up --build, when I change api.py (eg add content to array returned from get method) and save, docker-compose does not refresh the volume content on product-service container.
My text editor is sublime3 ( "atomic_save": false), I tried KWrite, same problem occurs.
I also connected to bash on running container using docker exec -it dockertests_product-service_1 /bin/bash and echoed api.py file - it didn't contain the change made on host.
I just recreate this short (12 minutes) tutorial about docker-compose https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9zlE3t8Ko , all this files are examples from tutorial.
Please provide some ideas how to debug this issue.
