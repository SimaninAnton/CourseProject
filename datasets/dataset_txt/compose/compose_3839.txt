Hey,
please, can you help me to find out what am I doing wrong.
This is my docker-compose.yml
myservice:
    hostname: myservice
    domainname: local
    image: localhost:5000/myservice
    ports:
     - "2222:22"
docker-compose up -d myservice works perfectly - my container is up and running. I can connect to it by ssh using IP , but I need to use constant hostname for this to be sure that i can connect to the right container each time I'm running my deployment script on ansible.
So after running this yml, my host machine does not have any new hosts in /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf so im not able to connect to container using myservice.local hostname.
What's wrong with it ? I wrote hostname just like it written in docker-compose documentation...
