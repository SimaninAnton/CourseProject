Step 1
State containers on host : API is ready
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                 COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                         NAMES         
9b463eaae4a6        cedvan/nginx-php-fpm:1.4.6-5.5.9  "/bin/sh -c 'php5-fp   7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp              project_api_1  
Step 2
docker-compose.yml on back project :
back:
    image: huttopia/nginx-php-fpm:1.4.6-5.5.9
    ...
    links:
        - project_api_1:api
Step 3
Result of fig up -d back :
Service "back" has a link to service "project_api_1" which does not exist.
Question
Is it possible to add support external links in docker-compose.yml ?
