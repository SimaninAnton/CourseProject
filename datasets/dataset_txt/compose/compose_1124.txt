Hi,
The docker-compose package on pypi gives a false implication that there is a python client library for docker-compose.
#4542 makes it clear that this isn't the case, and that the python library is just an internal piece of tooling.
Given this, it would be nicer from a community perspective if you remove this library from pypi, and just ship the code as part of your own distribution directly.
