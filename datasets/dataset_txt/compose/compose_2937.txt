## Service configuration reference I would most likely put under this heading a paragraph about the fact there are multiple versions. Then put a cross -reference to the version section to follow.
Then move ## Versioning to follow the main body of configuration material
This section would need to answer:
define whether the configuration version matches the product version
under what conditions can I use a different version; for example does the version of the configuration file match or differ from the Compose version
can I mix syntax in the same config file (prob not but should say)
can I use two config files that use differing versions of the syntax (I'm thinking also of how the override files interact with the main config under the version conditions)
provide some guidance to the reader under what circumstances this version mixing is useful
