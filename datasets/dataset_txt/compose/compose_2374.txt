I was trying to pull an image from a local repository and I am getting this error.
Snippet of my command and error:
linux-dwzm:/home/docker # docker pull 164.99.163.4/abhaysomani/sles12
Using default tag: latest
Pulling repository 164.99.163.4/abhaysomani/sles12
json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type string
and while searching, I get this error:
linux-dwzm:/home/docker # docker search 164.99.163.4/abhaysomani/sles12
Error response from daemon: Unexpected status code 404
However, if I try to search/pull hello-world image, it works perfectly.
docker version info :
linux-dwzm:~ # docker version
Client:
Version: 1.10.3
API version: 1.22
Go version: go1.5.3

My pull/search commands works perfectly with docker 1.6. I upgraded to the latest docker and started getting this error. If I downgrade and try again, everything works fine again.
I researched a bit and found that this thing got broken in version 1.8.1-43.3. It worked in version 1.7.1-40.1.
@dnephin : is this issue similar/side-effect to the issue #2515
