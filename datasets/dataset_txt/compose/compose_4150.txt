Hi everyone,
I have 4 different hosts, each of them running between 3 and 10 containers based on the same image. Each container is an agent for a Continuous Integration solution we use. That solution identify each agent to his hostname.
In order to troubleshoot easily when an issue occur, I want to define the domain name of my containers as bellow:
bambooAgent:
    domainname: ${HOSTNAME}
in order to have as final hostname something like:
c49d4b74cf30.mtl-myhost-vm1.
That way, I might be able to easily figure out on which host is running the guilty container and go inspect it.
Is there currently any way that I missed to use an host variable inside fig.yml?
