Hi,
I'm about to run docker-compose inside a container built with Dockerfile:
FROM alpine

RUN apk update && apk add curl
RUN curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.6.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/docker-compose"]
but then, running:
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock compose --help
leads to a no such file or directoryerror.
I read that this is due to docker-compose being binary compiled from python sources, using the glibc while alpine runs musl.
Would it be possible to get a docker-compose binary running on alpine?
