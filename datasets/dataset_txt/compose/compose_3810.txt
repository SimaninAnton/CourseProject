argparse is very powerful, supports sub-commands, and it's built-in Python. It's would be good to use it instead of the current solution because it would also make auto-completion free for Bash/ZSH/... using:
$ pip install argcomplete

# After initialiazing argparser:
import argcomplete
argcomplete.autocomplete(parser)

$ register-python-argcomplete docker-compose >_docker-compose
That generated script can be used in Bash and works in ZSH with bashcompinit.
