I'm having an issue with extra_hosts on compose.
$> docker -v               
Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
$> docker-compose -v 
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac219
The --add-host option works correctly with docker build but the extra_hosts of docker-compose doesn't.
I'm using a 3.3 version ok Compose file, here is a sample
version: '3.3'

services:
  my_service:
    build:
      context: ./some_folder
      args:
        ARG1: $ARG1
        ARG2: $ARG2
    extra_hosts:
      - "my.local.network.url:XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
    environment:
      SOME_VAR: $SOME_VAR
    volumes:
      - ./folder1:/folder1
My volumes are not interfering with /etc/hosts or anything like that.
Can anyone tell me if I'm doing anything wrong ?
