whenever i mount a directory to my local host filesystem and run fig up with watch command my CPU usage goes to 200%
config looks like:
volumes:
  - "./:/src"
command: /bin/sh -c "cd /src && ./watch_files"
however if i don't mount the directory and just copy files in there everything looks fine
i'm trying to use it for node applications development and basically watch all src files for changes and restart server / rebundle assets on every change
