Docker-Compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21.
In my docker-compose.yml I am using an environment variable, which, if unset, must default to an empty value:
version: '3.3'

services:
  test:
    image: alpine:latest
    command: echo "'${TEST:-}'"
Running this setup ends up with the following error:
$ TEST=test docker-compose up
ERROR: Invalid interpolation format for "command" option in service "test": "echo ${TEST:-}"
Adding a space after 'minus' works around this issue:
$ sed -e 's/:-/:- /' docker-compose.yml | TEST=test docker-compose -f - up
Recreating test_test_1 ...
Recreating test_test_1 ... done
Attaching to test_test_1
test_1  | 'test'
test_test_1 exited with code 0
But having an empty default should also work from my perspective.
