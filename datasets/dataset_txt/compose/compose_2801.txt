If you follow the logs in one window, and then kill and restart a container in another, then the first window will no longer get the logs of the (now running again) container. This is only an issue recently, since the addition of the (very useful) behaviour of not terminating the docker-compose logs command on termination of a single container. However, not re-following restarted containers means that a large number of people using this feature will run into the same thing that I did and be stumped for a while - probably blaming their own code. I think that this is the other half of that new behaviour, because without it you just have to kill and restart the docker-compose logs command anyways.
