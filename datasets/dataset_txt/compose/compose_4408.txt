On OS X with boot2docker 0.5.4:
$ docker version
Client version: 0.8.0
Go version (client): go1.2
Git commit (client): cc3a8c8
Server version: 0.8.0
Git commit (server): cc3a8c8
Go version (server): go1.2
$ ~/bin/boot2docker up
[2014-02-10 21:58:12] boot2docker-vm is already running.
$ echo $DOCKER_HOST
tcp://
$ fig --version
fig 0.2.1
$ fig up
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http:/ - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
docker build . worked fine for me, but fig seems unable to handle the tcp:// URL.
