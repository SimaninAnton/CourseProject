Before:
$ docker-compose build
Building frontend
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
Solution:
$ sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu .
After:
$ docker-compose build
Building frontend
Step 1/10 : FROM node:latest
latest: Pulling from library/node
As you can see - I did have directories utilized by the frontend service owned by root.
So I modified the owner of these directories and now the build is running - but the message is really, really confusing - can we add more meaningful message when there's a access issue?
