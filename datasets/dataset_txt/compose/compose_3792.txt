I would like to have a RUnit service to supervise a set of containers launched by docker-compose tool, here's my the runit script:
In /etc/sv/app/run
#!/bin/bash
exec 2>&1

APP_HOME=/home/myapp

source $APP_HOME/env.sh
exec docker-compose -f $APP_HOME/docker-compose.yml up
In docker-compose.yml
rabbitmq:
  build: ./rabbitmq/_image
  environment:
    - RABBITMQ_PASS
    - RABBITMQ_STOMP_CLIENT_NAME
    - RABBITMQ_STOMP_CLIENT_PASS
  ports:
    - "5672:5672"
 mysql:
   build: ./mysql/_image
   volumes_from:
     - mysql_data
  environment:
    - MYSQL_PASS
    - MYSQL_USER
    - MYSQL_DB
    - MYSQL_DB_TEST
  ports:
    - "3306:3306"
Here's what I have then:
sv start app - launches the docker-compose thing just fine
sv stop app - stops docker-compose process itself but for unknown reason it leaves the containers running
Is there any chance to have the stop command to stop containers as well? I thought that is what docker-compose should do when it gets stopped by RUnit.
