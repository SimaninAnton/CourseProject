Hi there,
I've got a little problem. I did this:
web:
  build: ./env/web/
  volumes:
    - ./env/web/:/var/www/html
cli:
  build: ./env/cli/
  volumes:
    - ./env/cli/:/app/
db:
  image: dockerfile/mariadb
  volumes:
    - ./data/db/mysql/:/var/lib/mysql/
Well, a fig build works nice, a fig up_ produces something like that:
Recreating exampletv_web_1...
Recreating exampletv_db_1...
Recreating exampletv_cli_1...
Attaching to exampletv_web_1, exampletv_cli_1
web_1 | AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.178. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

exampletv_cli_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping exampletv_web_1..
I think because of the cli container which is a run once container and does nothing by default. This is the desired behavior because fig run cli /bin/bash should be run manually.
Is there any way to disable this "dependency" behavior?
