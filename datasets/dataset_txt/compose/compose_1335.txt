Part of my docker-compose (Docker for Mac):
expose: 
  - "12201/udp"
  - "1514/udp"
ports:
  - "9000:9000"
  - "12201/udp:12201/udp"
  - "1514/udp:1514/udp"
When I run docker-compose up -d I get an console error: ERROR: Invalid published port: 12201/udp
It is greylog container so I do need to define and expose both 12201 and 1514 as "UDP"
When I do:
expose: 
  - "12201/udp"
  - "1514/udp"
ports:
  - "9000:9000"
  - "12201:12201/udp"
  - "1514:1514/udp"
Error disappear but the Greylog container does not work for me.
The weird thing is that the configuration I put at the top of this Issue works for some other people in my team but not me.
