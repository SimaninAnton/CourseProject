To run compose using only a pre-built image that does not match the projectName_service tag fails. However passing a project name in the -p flag that does not match the default name works.
Declaration in docker-compose.yml:
api:
  image: example/appname
 â€¦
Output when running docker-compose up
docker-compose up
Recreating appname_api_1...
No such image: appname_api:latest (tag: latest)
Works oddly when specifying -p flag with project name that does not match the default project name
docker-compose -p someothername up
Creating someothername_api_1...
Attaching to someothername_api_1
There should be no need to pass a project name to docker-compose up for this to work
