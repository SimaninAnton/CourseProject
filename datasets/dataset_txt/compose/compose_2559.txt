Currently, there appears to be no way to add a space character to an env_file entry.
Here are some of the combinations I have tried:
VAR=foo bar
VAR=foo\ bar
VAR='foo bar'
VAR="foo bar"
VAR='foo\ bar'
VAR={foo bar}
"VAR='foo bar'"
'VAR="foo bar"'
VAR=foo%20bar
VAR=foo&nbsp;bar
etc ...
I am using Docker 1.10.3 and Compose 1.7.0
This issue seems to be directly related to moby/moby#12997 which looked to be closed unsatisfactorily.
Another related issue may be: #2854
Any fix or work-around would be appreciated.
Thanks!
