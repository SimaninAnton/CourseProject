There are use-cases where you want to create base images ( which you'll use for creating other images ), but you don't need any containers from those images.
There are also use-cases where you want containers to be created, but purged once they ends ( like docker run --rm ... )
This could be configurable with the following syntax:
ubuntu:
  build: dockerfiles/ubuntu
  create_container: false # true is default
foobar:
  build: dockerfiles/foobar
  remove_container: true # false is default
