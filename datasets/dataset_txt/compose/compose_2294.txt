Hey,
It seems these two articles are duplicated:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/compose/yml/
One thing I noticed is that the compose-file docs have documentation around depends_on, while the yml file does not.
Should we just redirect to the compose-file docs and keep that as the canonical reference for what goes into docker-compose.yml?
