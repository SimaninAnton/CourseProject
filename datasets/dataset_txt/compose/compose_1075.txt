Hello docker-compose team,
I would be happy to have the docker run options "cpu-rt-period" and "cpu-rt-runtime" also available in docker-compose.
These options allow modification of the scheduling policy inside containers.
Based on my research these options are available in docker-py, but are not released yet.
Best regards
Sebastian
