How to reproduce
Using Docker For Windows (version 17.12.0-ce-rc3, build 80c8033) switch to LCOW mode and use some compose file like that:
version: '3'

services:
  wp:
    image: wordpress:4.9.1-apache
Then do a docker-compose up. And the following error is received:
Pulling wp (wordpress:4.9.1-apache)...
4.9.1-apache: Pulling from library/wordpress
ERROR: no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries
Expected behavior
Linux version of the image is pulled
Additional notes
Under LCOW using docker pull wordpress:4.9.1-apache pulls the correct version of the image.
Once the images are pulled docker-compose up works as expected.
