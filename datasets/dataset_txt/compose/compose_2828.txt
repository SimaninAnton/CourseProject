rm -v leaves data volumes in place and removes unnamed volumes (declared volumes from docker file).
down -v removes data volumes but leaves unnamed volumes, thus after down -v there are left over volumes.

So from what I understand the down command is supposed to cleanup everything, it should not leave the unnamed volumes.
Besides that, I think it is not intuitive for the -v switch to have different behavior on these commands.
I think -v should behave as it does now for rm -v and there should be an extra switch to remove data volumes.
