(NOTE, I have already installed sudo pip install --upgrade requests[security])
/usr/local/Cellar/fig/1.3.3/libexec/vendor/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:90: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.
