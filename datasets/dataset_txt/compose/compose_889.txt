With a docker-compose config like:
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx

  bash:
    image: ubuntu
    command: bash
    depends_on:
      - nginx
And an initial execution of
$ docker-compose up -d
With 1.19.0-rc3, build cdd0282 (macOS) is get
docker-compose up -d bash
Recreating dockerbug_nginx_1 ... done
Recreating dockerbug_bash_1 ... done
but with 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
docker-compose up -d bash
dockerbug_nginx_1 is up-to-date
Starting dockerbug_bash_1 ... done
as the nginx service didn't change I would expect 1.19 to also return up-to-date and to not restart the service.
