I really don't understand why this happens, but when building the "web" container based on the following docker-compose.yml file, my whole Internet connection is killed.
web:
  build: apps/web
  volumes:
    - /apps/web:/usr/src/app
  ports:
    - "80:3000"
  links:
    - db
  env_file: .env-production
Various software is complaining about timeouts, YT and other streams are stopped. The command line hangs with Building web.... Once compose proceeds with Step 0 : FROM ruby:2.2.1 everything goes back to normal. Btw this affects all other devices in my home network as well - my wife's Mac, our phones and so on.
