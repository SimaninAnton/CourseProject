I have the following compose file:
version: '2'
services:
  loadbalancer:
    image: some.registry/loadbalancer
    environment:
      - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:3375
      - constraint:node==epsilon
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:80:80"
      - "0.0.0.0:44304:44304"

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
Now I launch this one on my docker swarm:
root@epsilon:/home/vagrant# docker-compose -f /opt/compose/loadbalancer/docker-compose.yml up
Creating network "loadbalancer_default" with driver "bridge"
Creating loadbalancer_loadbalancer_1
ERROR: network loadbalancer_default not found
So I wondered why that might be. So i checked the networks
root@epsilon:/home/vagrant# docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                         DRIVER
195abbbe800c        epsilon/bridge               bridge              
d0ceb15f253c        alpha/none                   null                
5848b4344156        alpha/host                   host                
51b9fa03feeb        alpha/bridge                 bridge              
57dfc8f865f9        alpha/loadbalancer_default   bridge              
f4808456bc30        epsilon/host                 host                
72af6e4e6913        epsilon/docker_gwbridge      bridge              
175b77a7ce31        alpha/docker_gwbridge        bridge              
e29f50c47110        beta/bridge                  bridge              
9d4c94a8d7a8        epsilon/none                 null           
So even the composefile specifically said that the application must run on the epsilon node, the network was created on the alpha node. And that's why compose didn't find it.
I would expect that compose creates the network on the node that will actually run the container.
