This might be a new enhancement request not a bug
Support for specifying or passing docker-compose build options from docker-compose.yml
The build in docker-compose should support way to pass any build command arguments or options in the build section, similar to what we pass on command line
In general, It is super convenient if we can pass any build options we use on command line in docker-compose file itself
Also these options can be global and specific to each service
Consider this scenario
docker-compose has 5 services (or container definitions), each is built using its corresponding Dockerfile
One among those 5 services has to be built without caching (whatever may be the reason)
Currently to solve this we run command docker-compose --no-cache build
Problem with this is it rebuilds without cache all 5 services
Instead if the options can also be specified from docker-compose file and options can be global or specific service, only the specific service which needs to be built without cache can specify that option
Alternatively --no-cache can also take a comm separate string to avoid cache for specific service only
i.e., in docker-compose it can be like below
services:
  volatile-container
    build:
      context: ./
      target: sample
    options:
     - '--no-cache'
However if those options were specified form command line, they take the higher precedence
Can we please discuss this, may be I am not articulating clearly but I can see a scope and use
