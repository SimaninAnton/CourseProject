I have a use case where the images should not be pushed to a registry, but there is a high amount of duplication between the Dockerfiles for 2 or more services in my fig.yml.
Is it possible to have fig pre-parse the Dockerfiles it is about to use so that it can fix up references between images created for fig-defined services as in the below example?
fig.yml
a:
    build: ./a/

b:
    build ./b/
b/Dockerfile
FROM a
# OR
FROM fig://a
# OR
FROM project_a

# ...
