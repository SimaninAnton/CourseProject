According to the docs https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/,
--abort-on-container-exit should
Stop all containers if any container was stopped.
docker-compose.yml:
version: "2"

services:
    loop1:
        image: ubuntu:latest
        command: bash -c 'for i in {1..5}; do echo $$i && sleep 1; done'
        stop_signal: SIGKILL

    loop2:
        image: ubuntu:latest
        command: bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo $$i && sleep 1; done'
        stop_signal: SIGKILL
After docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit both containers start sending log messages.
When loop1 exits, documentation suggests that loop2 will also be stopped. This does not happen, which can be confirmed by executing docker-compose ps shortly after loop1 exits.
An other issue which may be related:
When hitting Ctrl-C after docker-compose up I would expect this:
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping dockercompose_loop1_1 ... done
Stopping dockercompose_loop2_1 ... done
This is only happening occasionally, most of the time I get this instead:
^CERROR: Aborting.
Also, the containers remain up.
