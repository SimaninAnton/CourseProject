Hi,
I'm trying to use docker-compose with docker 1.12 load balacing features.
I want to run more than one container and load balance them on port 8080 of the host.
This is my client and server versions:
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      1.12.0-rc5
...
Server:
 Version:      1.12.0-rc5
This is the compose file:
version: '2'                                                                                                                                                                 
services:

  example:
    image: xxx/yyy:latest
    hostname: example
    domainname: example.com
    port:
      - 8080:8080
I get an error publishing the same port when scaling:
$ docker-compose -f example.yml up -d
$ docker-compose -f example.yml scale example=2

are created on a single host, the port will clash.
Creating and starting user_example_1 ... error
Creating and starting user_example_2 ... error

ERROR: for user_example_1  Cannot start service example: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint user_example_1 (5d0c531d7dc6712e2351cb9138b525afebe6a8c4916afe9d5bd0eabebd371d73): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated

ERROR: for user_example_2  Cannot start service example: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint user_example_2 (c1e94bed968999fd5c8c24f4dfbc48b55e4aef5e4e4a3410bb48a4def71d4d1f): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated
I have no problems creating this service with the docker service command and load balance all containers on port 8080. I want to get the same results with docker compose.
Is there a way to define the load balancing on the compose file?
