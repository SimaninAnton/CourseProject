Various types of invalid configuration in override files (i.e. docker-compose.override.yml, or any file passed in via -f after the first one) result in stack traces, rather than validation errors.
Non-dictionary service entries:
$ cat docker-compose.override.yml
web: asdf

$ docker-compose up

Invalid option keys are ignored, rather than raising an error:
$ cat docker-compose.override.yml
web:
  nonsense: option

$ docker-compose up
...command runs as usual...
