init works fine in version 2.2:
cat > docker-compose.yml <<EOF
version: '2.2'
services:
  xyz:
    image: alpine
    command: sleep 5m
    init: true
EOF
docker-compose up -d
init fails in version 3.0:
cat > docker-compose.yml <<EOF
version: '3.0'
services:
  xyz:
    image: alpine
    command: sleep 5m
    init: true
EOF
docker-compose up -d
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for services.xyz: 'init'
This documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/
reports that init was introduced in version 2.2. There's no mention if it being removed.
Also tested with version 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3... init fails in all of them
