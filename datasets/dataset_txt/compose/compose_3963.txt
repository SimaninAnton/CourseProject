Hi,
This caused me much, much pain.
I'm using docker-compose with TLS enabled, however under the hood the tls library was using the environmental variables for proxy (which is fine) and I didn't have a no_proxy exemption for this host.
However the error you get back from docker doesn't make it clear:
$ docker-compose ps
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at https://localhost:2376 - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
So I spent hours trying to work out what's going on, before delving into the .py files and adding some "prints", to give me:
$ docker-compose ps
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=2376): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1.14/containers/json?all=1&limit=-1&trunc_cmd=1&size=0 (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', error('Tunnel connection failed: 503 Service Unavailable',)))
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at https://localhost:2376 - is it running?

If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
Therefore can I suggest that you output the HTTP Status code and a truncated message with this error?
