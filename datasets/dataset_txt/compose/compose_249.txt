Description of the issue
Image sizes in docker images output are formatted as decimal (KB, MB, GB). But image sizes in docker-compose images output are formatted as binary (KiB, MiB, GiB).
source where formatting sizes in docker images:
https://github.com/docker/go-units/blob/2fb04c6466a548a03cb009c5569ee1ab1e35398e/size.go#L59-L61
source where formatting sizes in docker-compose images:
compose/compose/cli/utils.py
Lines 141 to 143 in 8f86789
 def human_readable_file_size(size): 
     suffixes = ['B', 'kB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'PB', 'EB', ] 
     order = int(math.log(size, 2) / 10) if size else 0 
I'm not sure this issue is for docker/compose or docker/cli but output image sizes should be consistent.
