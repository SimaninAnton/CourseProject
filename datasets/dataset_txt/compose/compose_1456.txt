Hi,
It seem like there is a difference in the way docker-compose run ... populate DNS entries for the services in the compose file.
To reproduce, use a slightly modified version of the compose file from the dockercloud-hello-world repo:
version: '3.1'

services:
  helloworld:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - helloworld2
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  helloworld2:
    build: .
to just create one more service helloworld2 that helloworld depends on.
Now, if I bring up the composition with docker-compose up
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
50e974c34efb        dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld    "/bin/sh -c 'php-f..."   38 seconds ago      Up 37 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld_1
8794a0e04dba        dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld2   "/bin/sh -c 'php-f..."   38 seconds ago      Up 37 seconds       80/tcp               dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld2_1
I can then connect to both containers and ping from both to both, e.g.
docker exec -it 50e sh
/ # ping helloworld
PING helloworld (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.083 ms
^C
--- helloworld ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.083/0.083/0.085 ms
/ # ping helloworld2
PING helloworld2 (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.201 ms
64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.121 ms
^C
--- helloworld2 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.121/0.161/0.201 ms
/ #
But if I start the composition using docker-compose run --service-ports helloworld both services will be started since there is a dependency:
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
bc8ed7837923        dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld    "/bin/sh -c 'php-f..."   12 seconds ago      Up 11 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld_run_1
d69c037624eb        dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld2   "/bin/sh -c 'php-f..."   12 seconds ago      Up 11 seconds       80/tcp               dockercloudhelloworld_helloworld2_1
But connecting to each of them in the same way with docker exec, only the helloworld2 service have a DNS entry:
docker exec -it bc8 sh
/ # ping helloworld
ping: bad address 'helloworld'
/ # ping helloworld2
PING helloworld2 (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.196 ms
and
docker exec -it d69 sh
/ # ping helloworld
ping: bad address 'helloworld'
/ # ping helloworld2
PING helloworld2 (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes
I find this a bit peculiar and it would make sense to have all started services registered in the DNS just as they are with docker-compose up.
