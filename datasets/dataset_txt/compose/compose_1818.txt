When using the .dockerignore file, the warning when trying to use a file that matches this list is output as if the file doesn't exist at all, whereas it is actually just being ignored.
This took me some time to figure out, and should be made clearer.
The file does exist, it is just being ignored - the error message should say so.
.dockerignore

docker build . output:
