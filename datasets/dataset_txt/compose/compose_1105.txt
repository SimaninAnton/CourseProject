I just installed docker-compose today and found that the command on the release page did not work for me, but the commands in the Linux section in https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ did.
Output of the command from the release page:
$ sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-Linux-x86_64 > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

An error occurred while redirecting file '/usr/local/bin/docker-compose'
