I found this issue while working on a fix for issue #4337.
By running the following sequence of commands on this example repository:
git checkout tags/test2_run1
docker-compose build
docker rmi --force dctest_service1
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
Compose fails because the old image is never properly rebuilt from the old container:
WARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.

Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.

To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.
