I can see traces of it everywhere, e.g. in /etc/hosts:
172.17.0.198    848fdb642137
127.0.0.1   localhost
...
172.17.0.193    web_1
...
and
$ env | grep web
...
WEB_1_NAME=web_1
...
so fig has injected it in there somehow, but not in a very accessible way. It would be great to be able to discover that at runtime.
