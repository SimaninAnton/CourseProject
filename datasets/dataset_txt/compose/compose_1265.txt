Hi. A common pattern I use is like so:
[child.svc] inherits [parent.svc] inherits [parent.basesvc]
This equates to:
docker-compose.yml:web              # web (contains environment specifics for local dev)
  ^ extends compose/apps.yml:web    # base web service that is also inherited in other places, for say tests
    ^ extends compose/apps.yml:app  # base service that is inherited for all app containers
But this is broken with 1.15. For now I have downgraded to 1.14.
I haven't had much time to look into it yet, but it appears it may be an issue in dependency resolution?
Error below:
ERROR: Cannot extend service 'app' in PROJECT/compose/apps.yml: Service not found
I'm seeing this using version 2.1 of the compose file format, but it may affect others.
Ty!
