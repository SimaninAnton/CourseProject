My fig.yml:
mysql:
    image: orchardup/mysql
    ports:
        - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
        - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
        MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel
And this is what I get when running fig up:
$ fig up
Creating figmysqltest_mysql_1...

Note that I ran docker-osx destroy && docker-osx shell first.
The error isn't thrown when the volume to /var/lib/mysql isn't mounted.
Also running the container in the VM itself works perfectly fine, so it seems to be a bug in Fig.
Any idea what might cause this? I couldn't find the reason as to why the container tries to create the db table.
