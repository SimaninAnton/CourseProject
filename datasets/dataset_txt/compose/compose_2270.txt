Hi,
Could someone point me to instructions on using docker-compose to schedule services on the new docker-engine swarm mode cluster?
When I try to do a:
eval $(docker-machine env [swarm-master-hostname])
docker-compose up
All the services defined in my docker-compose.yaml file get started up as containers on the single host.
How can I get the services defined in my docker-compose file started up as "services" in swarm mode?
Thanks!
