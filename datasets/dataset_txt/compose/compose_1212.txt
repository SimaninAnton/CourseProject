I'm trying to override an ENTRYPOINT and CMD in a compose file. I've gotten a working solution, but I can't seem to reduce it.
Here is an example service container that launches a bash shell for me to work in with a virtual environment activated:
  # Ephemeral api service
  x-api:
    entrypoint: /bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -c \"$${@}\""
    command: |
      /bin/bash -c "
        set -e
        source ~/.env/api/bin/activate
        p-api config
        /bin/bash || exit 0
      "
    depends_on: *platform-depends_on
    environment: {<<: *platform-environment}
    image: *platform-image
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes: *platform-volumes
    working_dir: /srv/api
Three (or is it 4? or 5?) layers of bash shells seems to be over complicated. Is there a simpler solution?
