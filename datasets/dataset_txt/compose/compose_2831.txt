Abstract
docker-compose rm has a -v parameter to remove volumes associated with containers, but no -n(?) parameter to remove the network created by compose.
Steps to reproduce
docker network ls to list current networks
docker-compose up on a version 2 compose.yml
press CTRL-C to kill the containers
docker rm -rf
docker network ls
the created network is still there (compare to step 1)
Versions
Docker: 1.10.0
