Hi, getting this error in volume section of docker inspect command:
"Err": "create proxy_data: VolumeDriver.Create: {"Error":"googleapi: Error 400: Invalid value for field 'resource.name': 'proxy_data'. Must be a match of regex '(?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)', invalid"}\n",
using RexRay as volume driver in the following Docker Stack:
version: "3"

volumes: 
  data:
    driver: rexray
    driver_opts:
      size: "100"
      volumetype: "pd-ssd"

services:
  proxy:
    image: vfarcic/docker-flow-proxy
    volumes:
      - "data:/cfg/"
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
Expected behavior:
Volume creation in GCE ("disk") using RexRay.
Actual behavior:
Throws error for invalid naming, caused by the addition of underscore to the volume name. As stated in the docs this is the default behavior of Docker Compose.
In the example below, instead of attempting to create a volume called [projectname]_data, Compose will look for an existing volume simply called data and mount it into the db service’s containers.

Question/Request:
A way to alter Docker Compose default behavior of prefixing volume name when creating a new volume ?
Version & Info:
Using Google Cloud Platform to store volume (disk) data.
Local Host Docker version 1.13.1-rc1, build 2527cfc
Server Remote Docker version 1.13.0, build 49bf474
RexRay version 0.3.3
Temporary workaround:
Using external volume, with an already created volume in GCE with specific name. i.e. not using RexRay or docker volume create ...
