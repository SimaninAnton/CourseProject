Description of the issue
Looks like a regression to #1092. I found that when running a docker-compose command in a Git pre-commit hook the command would output nothing, but running the command in an interactive shell I would receive the expected output.
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa5906

Output of docker-compose config
Irrelevant, proprietary.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Set up any Linux container
Run docker-compose run --entrypoint=ls -T service-name <&- or docker-compose exec -T service-name ls <&-
Observed result
No output whatsoever.
Expected result
The output should list the files.
Additional information
Workaround: Make sure there is a TTY. In case of the Git hook, simply add exec < /dev/tty before the relevant command.
