When specifying a config file outside the current directory, docker-compose treats the directory containing the config file as the workdir, rather than the directory you're in:
$ tree
├── Dockerfile  # Contents: "CMD echo 'local'"
└── nested
    └── docker-compose.yml  # Contents: "echoer: {build: .}"
    └── Dockerfile  # Contents: "CMD echo 'nested'"
$ docker-compose -f nested/docker-compose.yml run echoer
nested  # I expected "local"
I think this is unintuitive and probably unintended behaviour. The location from which you're running docker-compose is almost certainly the intended work directory, rather than the directory containing the config file (it certainly is in my case).
