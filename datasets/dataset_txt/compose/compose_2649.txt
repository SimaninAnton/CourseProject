It is not possible to use network_mode to join the bridge network (as suggested in #3012)
in case the container needs to join both the bridge network and a custom network.
This use case was also discussed here #2701
I am using docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6 and Docker version 1.10.2, build c3959b1.
Example docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
  debian:
    image: debian:wheezy
    network_mode: "bridge"
    networks:
      - custom
networks:
  custom:
    external:
      name: customnetwork
Any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
