When COMPOSE_FILE directive is being used, docker-compose uses wrong relative path/build context for build instructions.
Demonstration.
Directory /Users/alexei.chekulaev/tmp/bug_demo
Structure:
bug_demo/
  conf/
    docker-compose.yml
  build/
    Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml contents:
version: "2.1"

services:
  test:
    build: build
Actual result when building in /Users/alexei.chekulaev/tmp/bug_demo:
$ pwd
/Users/alexei.chekulaev/tmp/bug_demo

$ COMPOSE_FILE="conf/docker-compose.yml" docker-compose config
ERROR: build path /Users/alexei.chekulaev/tmp/bug_demo/conf/build either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.
So docker-compose was looking for build dir in /Users/alexei.chekulaev/tmp/bug_demo/conf which is wrong.
Expected result: docker-compose should use CWD as current path, not the path where first config file was found.
