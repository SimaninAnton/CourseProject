Description of the issue
docker-compose up in container (jpetazzo/pseudo-dind) loses stdout if nothing is printed for a minute. Proposed labels: compose-in-a-container kind/bug
Context information (for bug reports)
docker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471
docker-py version: 3.3.0
CPython version: 2.7.12
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016
Steps to reproduce the issue
cat > Dockerfile -<<EOF
FROM bash
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "echo 1; sleep 63; echo 2" ]
EOF
docker build -t foo .
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti alpine:latest
The following commands occur within the alpine image
apk --update add py-pip && pip install docker-compose
cat > docker-compose.yml -<<EOF
version: "2"
services:
   foo:
     image: "foo"
EOF
docker-compose up 
Observed result
foo_1  | 1
default_foo_1 exited with code 0
Expected result
foo_1  | 1
foo_1  | 2
default_foo_1 exited with code 0
The expected result can be achieved by sleeping for less than 60 seconds in step 1, or by pip3 install docker-compose (instead of plain pip) in step 4 thereby getting a CPython version that is 3.x.
