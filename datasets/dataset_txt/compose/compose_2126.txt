Example:
version: '2'
services:
  some_service:
    build: ./something
    volumes: 
    - ~/somedir:/root/somedir
I use a remote docker daemon. I would expect ~ to resolute on the remote system rather than on the local system.
I run docker-compose on a Mac system, so the docker-compose client expands ~ to /Users/myuser. This path does not exist on the remote system, so it will actually create a /Users/myuser/something folder on my Linux system.
