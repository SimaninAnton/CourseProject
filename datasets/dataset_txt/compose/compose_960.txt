Docker Compose Version
docker-compose version 1.17.0, build ac53b73
docker-py version: 2.5.1
CPython version: 2.7.13
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016
I have tried setting
DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.23
I use the command
docker-compose pull --parallel
I use version 3 in compose.yaml
I get the error
client is newer than server (client API version: 1.25, server API version: 1.23).
The docker compose pull command does not give any way to set the client version internally. Also setting the DOCKER_API_VERSION environment variable is not helping. Can anybody please help?
