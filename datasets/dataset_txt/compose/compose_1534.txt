With docker-compose (version 1.11.2) one can set an environment variable inside the the docker-compose file like this:
redis:
  image: "registry.example.com/namespace/redis:{TAG}" 
as mentioned here https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/
Now if this TAG variable is empty a docker-compose pull redis does the following:
WARNING: The TAG variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Pulling redis (registry.example.com/namespace/redis:latest)...

So it seems to download the registry.example.com/namespace/redis:latest, which is in my opinion perfectly cool when it uses for default the latest tag on an empty ENV variable. However for starting/upping it tries to start this:
 registry.example.com/namespace/redis:
without the latest tag. It would be nice if also for start/up it would also use the latest tag per default if the TAG environment variable is empty!
thanks!
