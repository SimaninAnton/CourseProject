Right now, if a compose file references an undefined environment variable, docker-compose prints a warning and defaults it's value to an empty string, as described here.
This may not always be the desired approach and can mask a failure in continuous deployment environment.
I think there are 2 backward compatible ways to address this:
Add a option to enable strict config validation. E.g. docker-compose config --strict
Add support for ${VARIABLE?err_msg} and ${VARIABLE:?err_msg} substitution syntax.
