Description of the issue
I'd like to utilize runc's config.json support for hooks in order to leverage the oci-register-machine and oci-systemd-hook hooks for better management of logs and such.
Not sure if being able to specify config.json is the proper way of doing it, but it seems like it'd be able to work.
Expected result
Containers and logs should be available via machinectl and journalctl -M.
