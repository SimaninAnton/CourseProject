hi there i have a question:
Dockerfile (This is my base image for production ready env):
FROM ubuntu:trusty

# install system packages
RUN apt-get update -qq -y && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    && apt-get install -qq -y gettext git libffi-dev libpq-dev \
     python python-pip python-dev \
...
the resulted images must tagged as : web_base
Dockerfile (this is my dev image which is interdependent with the first dockerfile - see the FROM Part):
FROM web_base
USER root
# install system packages
RUN apt-get update -qq -y && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
        && apt-get install -qq -y git openssh-server vim wget
....
My docker-compose_dev.yml:
...
web_base:
    build: .
    image: web_base
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    security_opt:
      - apparmor=docker-default
      - no-new-privileges
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SYS_CHROOT
      - AUDIT_WRITE
    depends_on:
      - db
      - db_templates
      - redis
      - web_base
if i run docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev.yml up --build
the first dockerfile is builded. The seccond dockerfile which depends on the first dockerfile is builded and the web container starts. but also from the first dockerfile a container named "web_base" is created which stops.
I want to build the 1. Dockerfile and then the 2. Dockerfile and create only 1 Container named web, how could this be reached?
I know that i could run docker build . -t web_base and then run docker-compose without the "web_base" service.But than i have to execute 2 commands...
thanks
