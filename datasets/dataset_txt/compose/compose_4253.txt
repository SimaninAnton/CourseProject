requirements.txt with == operator is meant to be used when you need completely limit the versions of package. fig uses requirements.txt input in setup.py to fill install_requires. If any package installed after fig requires other version or updates the dependency things will break.
fig up -d

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: requests==2.2.1
The latest version of requests package available is 2.3.0 (which was installed in this case) and it's of course backward compatibile. You should either stop relaying on reading requirements.txt or start using >= operator.
