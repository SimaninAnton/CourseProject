We used to create big compose-file from small composes via config command, with some variable preserved so they can be defined later on.
a.yml
services:
  a:
    image: ${registry}/my:image
b.yml
services:
  a:
    environment:
      ENVIRONMENT: ${env}
We produced our final compose via
docker-compose -f a.yml -f b.yml config
with variables as
env=prod
registry="\${registry}"
so final compose looked like
services:
  a:
    environment: prod
    image: ${registry}
now the last line is
    image: $${registry}
is there some way to preserve old behavior? Or do we need to process compose file elsewhere after generating it?
