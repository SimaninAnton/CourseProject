Would it be possible to allow tmpfs volumes in top-level volumes configuration? Currently it's possible only with long syntax for single service.
Use case - multiple services using the same temporary volume, for cache for example, that would be cleared on containers stop / restart.
Current service volumes long syntax documentation:
type: the mount type volume, bind or tmpfs
source: the source of the mount, a path on the host for a bind mount, or the name of a volume defined in the top-level volumes key. Not applicable for a tmpfs mount.
