I have the following compose file:
mysql:
  image: mariadb:10
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: xxx

server:
  image: php:5.6-apache
  links:
    - mysql:mysql
Now when I run
docker-compose create && docker-compose start
And run
docker exec -it ..._server_1 ping mysql
it returns
ping: unknown host
(though docker exec -it ..._server_1 ping < IP-Address of container> works)
If I instead create the containers with docker-compose up command and ping the mysql-container, it works!
What is the difference between these commands?
