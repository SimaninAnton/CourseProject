Ok, trying to get a workaround of other issue (#1883) I've faced another.
New file structure:
project
|-environments
|-|-production-compose.yml
|-production.docker
production-compose.yml:
web:
  build: ../../
  dockerfile: production.docker
results in:
Cannot locate specified Dockerfile: production.docker
other variant:
web:
  build: ../../
  dockerfile: ../../production.docker
results in:
The Dockerfile (../../production.docker) must be within the build context
So, it looks for dockerfile relative to compose.yml, but it ignores specified build context. I understand that it will work if place all in root, but such polution of project root is not good. And it kills all advantages of -f option
