This is basically the same issue as #2866 (which was fixed in #2894). I was hoping that using volumes_from would allow the container to be successfully recreated, but that seems to not be the case.
What I Have
Full project is available on github: https://github.com/rmelick/docker-compose-up
Docker Versions
Docker version 1.11.1, build 5604cbe
docker-machine version 0.6.0, build e27fb87
docker-compose version 1.6.2, build 4d72027
Swarm Cluster
3 nodes in aws (1 running consul, 1 master, 1 node for deploying the app).
Created using docker-machine (swarm/swarm.sh create)
Docker images
I have two example images.
The data-container, which contains a volume that will be mounted by the app container using volumes_from
FROM alpine:3.3
RUN rm -f "/environment-conf"
RUN mkdir "/environment-conf"
COPY . /environment-conf
VOLUME ["/environment-conf"]
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
The app-container
FROM alpine:3.3
ENV cacheBust 2
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
What I Do
With the following docker-compose file (also available at https://github.com/rmelick/docker-compose-up/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    image: rmelick/docker-compose-up-app-container:latest
    hostname: app
    container_name: app
    ports:
     - "10080:10080"
    volumes_from:
      - appConfig:ro
    environment:
      - "constraint:node==docker-compose-up-node"
  appConfig:
    image: rmelick/docker-compose-up-data-container:latest
    environment:
      - "constraint:node==docker-compose-up-node"
I run the following
eval $(docker-machine env --swarm docker-compose-up-master)
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
What I Expected
I expected the app container to be recreated successfully
What Happened Instead
I saw the following error
rmelick@rmelick-ld:~/src/other/docker-compose-up$ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
Recreating dockercomposeup_appConfig_1
Recreating app
ERROR: Unable to find a node that satisfies the following conditions

Question
The comments in #2866 and #2894 implied this failure would happen if my app container had volumes that needed to be copied over to its replacement instance during the --force-recreate. But, the only volume it's using is the read only volume supplied by the data container. It would be totally ok to recreate my app container without copying any volumes, right?
