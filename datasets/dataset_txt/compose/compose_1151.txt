Docker version 1.12.3, build 6b644ec
Problem 1:
When we start "compose up", we found all the containers are in "created" status, from container log, we get "failed to set memory.kmem.limit_in_bytes, because either tasks have already joined this cgroup or it has children."
Problem 2:
All of our containers are start as "host" network mode, and when we start the "compose up", I find the compose will create a bridge interface (even though, there is no container really use "bridge") using IP "172.18.0.1", that is ok.
But when we found the "compose up" failed, and try to run "compose up" again, we don't know why the docker-compose create another "bridge" (IP 172.19.0.1), and not disable the privious "bridge" interface(172.18.0.1).
So, in our host, we found many bridge interfaces if we try many "compose up" and failed.
And idea about these 2 problems?
