When trying to use a docker-compose.yml file like this one:
version: "2"

services:
    foo:
        build:
            dockerfile: "Dockerfile.foo"
The failure mode from docker-compose 1.6.0 is an unhandled UnboundLocalError:

This makes it difficult to understand the problem - which seems to be that the context has not been specified.
