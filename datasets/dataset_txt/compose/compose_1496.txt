Say I have a master container dependent on a slave container. I may just run docker-compose up master to test something specific on the master container. Because the slave container is dependent, it is automatically brought up as well. When I exit the compose up command it only cleans up the master container, it doesn't touch the slave container.
Replicate:
docker-compose.yaml:
version: '2'
services:
    node1:
        image: centos:latest
        depends_on: [node2, node3]
        command: bash -c 'while true; do sleep 1; done'

    node2:
        image: centos:latest
        command: bash -c 'while true; do sleep 1; done'

    node3:
        image: centos:latest
        command: bash -c 'while true; do sleep 1; done'
Run: docker-compose up node
Then press Ctrl+C
Then docker ps, you'll see node2 and node3 are still there, even though node1 was cleaned up.
Versions:
docker-compose version 1.12.0, build unknown
Docker version 17.04.0-ce, build 4845c56
Seems tangentially related to issue #3397
