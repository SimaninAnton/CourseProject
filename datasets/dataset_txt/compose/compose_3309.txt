Hi! I have a web container where I run Nginx with upstream set to server app:8080;. app is a container running unicorn. When I up everything at the start it's all working fine but if I issue a docker-compose restart app then Nginx stops being able to route to the upstream server with the error:
connect() failed (113: No route to host) while connecting to upstream
I have to also restart the web container for it to start working again. I checked the hosts file but the IP of the app container remains the same after restarting the web container.
I'm I missing some detail about how docker-compose works?
My docker-composer-yml:
dbdata:
  image: postgres:9.4.4

db:
  image: postgres:9.4.4
  volumes_from:
    - dbdata
  env_file: .env

app:
  build: .
  links:
    - db
  volumes:
    - .:/app

web:
  image: nginx:1.9
  ports:
    - '3000:80'
    - '3443:443'
  links:
    - app
  volumes:
    - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  volumes_from:
    - app
