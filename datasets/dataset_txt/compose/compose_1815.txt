docker-compose 1.9.0 ignores volume from the symlink.
I have a symlinked path current in a /home/host/www/site.com/current which linked to a /home/host/www/site.com/releases/[timestamp], where [timestamp] is dynamic path created on each deployment.
I have the following docker-compose config:
  volumes:
    - ./data/elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
  image: elasticsearch:2.1.0
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:12001:9200"
  restart: always
Once I run docker-compose -p site up -d from the current path, docker inspect returns the following config data:
        "HostConfig": {
            "Binds": [
                "/home/host/www/site.com/releases/20170106124517/data/elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data:rw"
            ],
...
        "Mounts": [
            {
                "Source": "/home/host/www/site.com/releases/20170106124517/data/elasticsearch",
                "Destination": "/usr/share/elasticsearch/data",
                "Mode": "rw",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": "rprivate"
            }
        ],
Means instead of /home/host/www/site.com/current/data/elasticsearch path it use /home/host/www/site.com/releases/20170106124517/data/elasticsearch path.
Is there are a solution, that allows me to bind mounted volume to a symlink, instead of a real path behind the symlink?
