Builder

* Dockerfile to use for a given docker build can be specified with the -f flag
It's means that we can point our Dockerfile in diffrent place than context directory is, for example:
docker build -f ./backend/Dockerfile .
(Context is current directory, dockerfile is inside ./backend directory)
So, we need new yaml key to support this.
I propose left build key and simply add Dockerfile key, to support this flag.
