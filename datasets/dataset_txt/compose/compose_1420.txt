This is an issue if the value is a string 'Y', because the output Y is interpreted as a boolean. That fails validation in docker stack deploy.
Take this (partial) source file:
version: '3.2'
services:
  db:
    image: microsoft/mssql-server-windows-express
    environment: 
      ACCEPT_EULA: 'Y'
docker-compose config > docker-compose.stack.yml renders a new file with the quotes removed in the service definition:
services:
  db:
    environment:
      ACCEPT_EULA: Y
    image: microsoft/mssql-server-windows-express
version: '3.2'
If you try to deploy the generated file, you'll get an error:
services.db.environment.ACCEPT_EULA must be a string, number or null
There's no workaround that I can find using >, | or !!str.
