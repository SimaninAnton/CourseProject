Sorry, maybe it is answered in another place, but I didn't find the solution. So my problem is the following.
We use tomcat and we pass a lot of values to CATALINA_OPTS during image builds, but not all of them cause some of them determined when the container starts. I would like to extend the CATALINA_OPTS variable during service starting.
Here is an example image.
FROM alpine

ENV EXAMPLE_VARIABLE 42

ADD test_script.sh /

CMD ["/test_script.sh"]
The content of the test_script.sh is the following:
#!/bin/sh

echo $EXAMPLE_VARIABLE
The compose file is looks like this:
test:
    build: .
    environment:
        - EXAMPLE_VARIABLE=$$EXAMPLE_VARIABLE 56
So when I built the image and say docker-compose up.
Now i see: " $EXAMPLE_VARIABLE 56" in the output
Is it possible somehow to reach to see "42 56" in the console ?
