We expect docker-compose rm [-f] to completely remove the containers managed by docker-compose. For example, docker-compose rm -f && docker-compose up should be enough to completely wipe the containers and launch a new set. For example, when troubleshooting a Kafka cluster from zoidbergwill/docker-compose-kafka, users want a convenient way to wipe and recreate the entire stack in docker-compose, to eliminate any mistakes in the current configuration.
What actually happens, is that docker-compose rm only sees the containers that are currently running. As a workaround, users have to do a really awkward series of
$ docker-compose up
(Wait for containers to come up)
(Send docker-compose up a kill signal with Control+C)
(Wait for docker-compose up to die a certain way)

$ docker-compose rm -f
$ docker-compose up
This sucks, please fix.
