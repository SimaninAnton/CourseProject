My application was working fine but suddenly I start to get this message:
The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.
Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.
I am not using swarm in my application but I worked with it before this app.
