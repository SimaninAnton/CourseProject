Getting below failure when I try to run a service with an environment variable override. Also showed fig.yml let me know if you need more info. Using version 1.1.0.
$ docker-compose run -e FOO=bar test
fig.yml is deprecated and will not be supported in future. Please rename your config file to docker-compose.yml
