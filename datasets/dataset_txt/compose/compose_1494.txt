This is the same issue as #4348 and #3429, but for secrets.
Running docker-compose config with this yml:
version: "3.1"

services:
  s1:
    image: someimage
    secrets:
      - secret1
      - secret2

secrets:
  secret1:
    external: true
  secret2:
    external: true
produces this:
networks: {}
secrets:
  secret1:
    external: true
    external_name: secret1
  secret2:
    external: true
    external_name: secret2
services:
  s1:
    image: someimage
    secrets:
    - source: secret1
    - source: secret2
version: '3.1'
volumes: {}
Trying to use this with docker stack deploy then produces this error:
external_name Additional property external_name is not allowed
I tried this with docker 1.12.0 and 1.13.0-rc1 with the same result.
