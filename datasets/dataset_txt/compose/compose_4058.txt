I have the following fig.yml
nginx:
  image: anentropic/nginx
  links:
    - dpm
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "443:443"
  volumes_from:
    - nginxconf

nginxconf:
  image: anentropic/nginx_conf
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
  links:
    - uwsgi_app
nginxconf service CMD runs a script which queries the docker api in order to generate nginx conf for containers that need it, the script exits naturally with a code 0
problem I saw is the first time I fig up this happens:
anentropic_nginxconf_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping anentropic_nginx_1...
Stopping anentropic_dpm_1...
Stopping anentropic_postgres_1...
a bit annoying, but curiously if I do fig up again I see:
$ fig up
Recreating anentropic_postgresdata_1...
Recreating anentropic_postgres_1...
Recreating anentropic_uwsgi_app_1...
Recreating anentropic_nginxconf_1...
Recreating anentropic_nginx_1...
Attaching to anentropic_postgres_1, anentropic_uwsgi_app_1, anentropic_nginx_1
...
...this time everything stays up
Why is this?
Is there some way I should adapt either my nginx_conf image or my fig.yml to avoid needing to up twice?
