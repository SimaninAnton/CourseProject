I’m trying to create a network that will get an IP from a IPAM driver. The following docker command works great:
docker network create -d qnet --ipam-driver=qnet --ipam-opt=iface=eth1 qnet-dhcp-eth1
However, I’d like to have this work from my compose file. Here is what I have for the network section of the compose file:
networks:
  back:
    driver: customer-driver-1
  front:
    ipam:
      driver: qnet
      options:
        iface: eth1
When I try this, however, I get a weird error:
Creating network “mywordpress_front” with the default driver
ERROR: ipv4 pool is empty
DESKTOP-8O0TNFC
Do I have the syntax wrong in the compose file?
Or is it a bug? Or worse - not supported?
