It would be nice if docker-compose up|down|.. would look for custom scripts in the current directory, like:
docker-compose.before.up
docker-compose.after.up
I guess this is mostly helpful when docker-compose is used to run the development environment. These scripts should not be meant to configure containers.
My current use-cases include:
set up hostnames in /etc/hosts after container startup
run docker-rsync after container started
Eventually docker-compose should allow these scripts to run in the background and stream stdout/stderr to docker-compose logs.
