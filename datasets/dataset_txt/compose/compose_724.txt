Anybody can comment on my question here?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49973247/docker-compose-exit-code-from-is-ignored
Supposed I have multiple containers deployed
init
service1
service2
db
web
test
The init container runs into completion and then shutdowns by itself. That is his job, which is to do some pre-configuration stuffs then exit.
When running locally, I dont have any issues running this in my desktop work environment.
My issue is when it is deployed in my CI pipeline. When my init container finished up...it shutdowns the whole docker-compose network. Even if I explicitly set the --exit-code-from into my test container.
docker-compose up --exit-code-from test
The end result is that I am not able to run my test cases to its completion because everything is being shutdown by the init container that exits. Anybody has hints what can I do?
