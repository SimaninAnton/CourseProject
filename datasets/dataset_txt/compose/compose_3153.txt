Example:
web:
    image: "alpine:edge"
    name: "different name"
This config would be valid, but shouldn't be. I think name is included because we modify the config to move the name in as a field, but I think we should validate it separately as part of the "top level" validation instead.
The example config should raise an error about an unsupported key.
