In advance, sorry if this topic is already discussed somewhere else, I remember some comments here and there.
When I run docker-compose pull on against a swarm all images are pulled on all nodes - also if you have defined constraints.
It would be really helpful, if docker-compose would pull only on those node(s), which match the constraints, eg app==1.
