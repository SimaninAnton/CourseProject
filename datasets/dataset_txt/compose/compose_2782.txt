There's a bunch of history in #1040 and #2055.
We've tried multiple implementations of signal handlers, but each has their own set of issues, but ONLY when run from the frozen binary created by pyinstaller.
It looks like there is a very old issue in pyinstaller around this: pyinstaller/pyinstaller#208
These problems can manifest in three ways:
a thread.error when a signal interrupts a thread lock
the signal handlers being completely ignored and raising a KeynoardInterupt instead
the signal handlers being registered but the try/except to handle the except is skipped (this could be caused by the signal firing multiple times for a single ctrl-c, but I can't really verify that's what is happening)
