Can you please publish the binaries with Python 3 embedded somewhere?
I realize they are still in a bit of beta, so they could be marked as beta or put behind a link, or under some nightly/unstable builds area, or something.
I'm running into an issue with encodings that python 3 solves: #2775
Side benefit would be more people looking at and reporting any issues with the python 3 versions.
