Each time, I change even a single line in source code i need to close the current docker-compose run by pressing ctrl+c then start a new one using command docker-compose up.
Is their exist any command for docker-compose so that I donot need to restart docker-compose everytime and it automatically rebuilds using the changed and latest source code.
Thank you
