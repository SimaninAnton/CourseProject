I started playing with Fig yesterday and when I wanted to start fresh today on project, I cleaned all Docker images (using docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)). I thought Fig would rebuild as it did yesterday, but no. After that, Fig was looking for an image that didn't exist.
Then I uninstalled Fig, Docker and even cleaned Docker folder inside /var/lib/Docker. But without success... Now web and db services build but don't work. Is there any place Fig store this info?
