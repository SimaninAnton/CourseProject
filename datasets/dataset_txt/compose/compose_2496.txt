If I set up a network using the "docker network" cli command:
docker network create --subnet=192.168.2.0/24 --gateway=192.168.2.254 \
--ip-range=192.168.2.0/24 -o "com.docker.network.bridge.name"="house_lan" house_lan
I get a network called "house_lan".
If I try and simulate this command with docker-compose.yml entries:
networks:
  house_lan:
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:
       com.docker.network.bridge.name: "house_lan"
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 192.168.2.0/24
          iprange: 192.168.2.0/24
          gateway: 192.168.2.25
I get a network called "dockernetworking2_house_lan" which is to be expected given docker-composes scaling features. The directory in this instance is docker-networking-2.
How do I over ride this project naming feature to create a named network, is there a network_name item similar to the services container_name or some other way of ensuring the network name has no project attached to the front?
