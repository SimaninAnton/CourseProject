I have two docker-compose files, docker-compose.yml and production.yml.
docker-compose.yml uses development.env.
docker-compose.yml uses production.env
When building the image like so
$ docker-compose -f production.yml build
$ docker-compose -f production.yml up -d
My environment variables from production.env doesn't get picked up, the one in development.env get picked up.
