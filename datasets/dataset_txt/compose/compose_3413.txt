I have seen this issue for a while, across a few different docker-compose versions, and within multiple infrastructures.
Essentially, docker-compose fails when trying to pull an image from a private repository. It complains of the HTTPS endpoint on the registry being unresponsive, when in fact it is not.
Here is one actual case of this:
Registry is reachable on HTTPS with a valid cert, trusted by this client:
# curl https://registry.acme.private
"\"docker-registry server\""
Manual pull of the image works fine:
# docker pull registry.acme.private/tester
Pulling repository registry.acme.private/tester
8c2e06607696: Download complete 
cf2616975b4a: Download complete 
6ce2e90b0bc7: Download complete 
Status: Downloaded newer image for registry.acme.private/tester:latest
But, using this docker-compose.yml:
# cat docker-compose.yml 
Tester:
  image: registry.acme.private/tester
...docker-compose fails:
# docker-compose up
Pulling Tester (registry.acme.private/tester:latest)...
