Issue
docker-compose run doesn't respect the port mapping
Expected
docker-compose up and docker-compose run should behave similarly, except you only run 1 service instead of the entire stack.
Steps to reproduce
Create a docker-compose.yaml file a test folder:
redis:
  image: redis
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
Getting the container up and running with docker-compose up will create the proper container and will have the ports mapped (as expected)
$ docker port test_redis_1
6379/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:6739
Running the same file via docker-compose run redis will create a container without the ports mapped.
$ docker port test_redis_run_1
(empty)
