When I use docker-compose start before a docker-compose up I obtain the following result:
Starting mongo         ... done
Starting elasticsearch ... done
Starting transporter   ... done
Starting pdf           ... done
Starting back          ... done
Starting front         ... done
ERROR: No containers to start
This behaviour is pretty strange as the output is contradictory it says that it start all containers but the errors say the opposite.
