Hello,
I couldn't find a way to use the "nocopy" flag when using a named volume, as docker do in its "docker run" command :
-v, --volume=[host-src:]container-dest[:]: Bind mount a volume.
The comma-delimited options are [rw|ro], [z|Z],
[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private], and [nocopy].
The 'host-src' is an absolute path or a name value.
If neither 'rw' or 'ro' is specified then the volume is mounted in
read-write mode.
The nocopy modes is used to disable automatic copying requested volume
path in the container to the volume storage location.
For named volumes, copy is the default mode. Copy modes are not supported
for bind-mounted volumes.
--volumes-from="": Mount all volumes from the given container(s)
Is there a way to reproduce this behavior in the docker-compose file ?
If not, do you think that could be a feature to add ?
