Hello ,
I have installed docker on red het 7 and it's succeeded.
I tried to install the compose with this command: +1:
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.7.1/docker-compose-`uname -s-uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
When I run the command
docker-compose --version
And got
bash: docker-compose: command not found
How can I fix it?
