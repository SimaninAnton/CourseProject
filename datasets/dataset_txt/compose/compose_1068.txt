All of the above indicate that the minimum version for docker-compose file format version 3.4 is docker-compose 17.09.0+.
However, references in this repository, at
https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases
(Possibly others, I didn't look) say that the minimum Docker Engine version for compose file version 3.4 is 17.06.0+. One or the other is wrong. Please correct this to be consistent one way or the other.
