I'm encountering some odd situations where compose seems to hang any time it reaches the last container in my configuration:
$ docker-compose up
Creating project_data
Creating project_fpm
Creating project_nginx
Here's my .yml file for compose:
data:
  container_name: project_data
  image: ubuntu
  volumes:
    - /var/data/files

# HTTP

nginx:

  container_name: project_nginx
  build: .
  dockerfile: laravel/Dockerfile.nginx

  volumes_from:
    - data

  links:
    - fpm:fpm

  ports:
    - "80:80"

fpm:

  container_name: project_fpm
  build: .
  dockerfile: laravel/Dockerfile.fpm

  volumes_from:
    - data
What's odd is if I do a ctrl-c and then re-run docker-compose up, the behaviour is the same, but the last message is slightly different:
$ docker-compose up
Starting project_data
project_fpm is up-to-date
Starting project_nginx
Although unfortunately, even on the second run, my web service isn't running. As far as what the fpm and nginx containers are using for Dockerfiles, it's just the official ones for php and nginx from the docker hub.
If there's anything I can do to get better insights, let me know and I'll paste the output here. But I feel like something isn't quite right.
