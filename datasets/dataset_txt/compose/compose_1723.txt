docker-compose scale has no ability to specify variables
docker-compose version 1.7.0, build unknown
for example,
I have the following docker-compose.yaml. I want to pin each container to a separate core. Hopefully, I can run it like docker-compose scale up cassandra-node=3 $cpuset=id
networks: {}
services:
  cassandra-node:
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_SEEDS: seed1
    image: cassandra
    links:
    - 
    restart: always
    cpuset: "1"
 
  cassandra-seed1:
    container_name: cassandra-seed1
    hostname: cassandra-seed1
    image: cassandra
    ports:
    - 9042:9042
    restart: always
    cpuset: "0"
 
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
