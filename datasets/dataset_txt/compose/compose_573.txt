Docker compose up doesnt work when providing --scale flag anymore
I have 2 compose files that i'm trying to run using docker-compose up
The compose files require one service to start with 5 containers. So i'm using --scale flag
Without scale flag the build is successfull, with it docker-compose gives me up command info:
Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service etc....
The full command is as follows
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-common.yml -f docker/docker-compose-prod.yml -p sidprod up -d --scale adt=5
Just without the --scale flag at the end it builds containers as it should.
With it it throws that up command info.
The adt service is existing that's not the problem
docker version: 18.03 on ubuntu
docker-compose files version used: 2.0
Docker documentation still shows the --scale flag as being used in the system which is not helping me with this
