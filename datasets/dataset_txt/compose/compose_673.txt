Trying docker-compose up with the following:
version: "3"
services:
postgres-db :
image: postgres
ports:
"5432:5432"
networks:
backend
deploy:
replicas: 1
restart_policy:
condition: on-failure
environment:
POSTGRES_DB: "drizl"
POSTGRES_USER: "user"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "password"
Expected behavior
brings up postgres container
Actual behavior
Creating _config_postgres_1 ... error
ERROR: for _config_postgres_1 Cannot create container for service postgres: b'Invalid container name (config_postgres_1), only [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9.-] are allowed'
Information
The reason for the problem is that the containing directory was named "_Config". Changing the name to not start with an underscore fixed the issue. Apparently nobody names directories using leading underscore characters.
