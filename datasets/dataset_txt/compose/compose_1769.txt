first, I defined the healthcheck section in compose file like this:
healthcheck:
  test: ...
  interval: 1m30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
then I use docker-compose config > compose.yml to generate the whole compose file to be used by deploy. when I use docker stack deploy -c compose.yml srv to create the stack, error:
services.nginx.healthcheck.interval must be a string
maybe docker-compose config should parse the time into string?
