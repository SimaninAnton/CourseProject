Hello guys,
I got this error when trying to use my custom certs. It works fine with docker so I suppose it comes from docker-compose. I looked back at the older issues and I already tried many versions of openssl.
I don't use boot2docker but my own vm made with vagrant/vbox. Docker CLI on my host (OSX) can easily talks with docker daemon located on the guest OS (ubuntu/trusty64).
I generated the certs by following the docker documentation.
$ docker-compose up
SSL error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:581)
$ docker run hello-world
Hello from Docker.
