When running docker-compose with a /tmp filesystem that is set to noexec in fstab docker-compose fails with error message similar to: "error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1".
In earlier versions of docker-compose we have worked-around this by setting TMP environment-variable to point to some other directory where noexec is not set, but this doesn't work anymore in 1.6.2.
Is there a suggested workaround for this?
We also tried TMPDIR and TEMP but nothing works.
See also issue #2886, looks like a regression.
