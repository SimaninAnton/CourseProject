It seems that if one uses a folded-style (>) long string for an environment variable, a newline gets inserted at the end of the string. A trivial example:
version: '2'
services:
  foo:
    image: python:2.7
    environment:
      FOO: >
        This is
        a
        very long
        line
[I] /t/docker-compose-folded-line âˆ« dc run --rm foo /bin/bash                                                     [12:50:07]
