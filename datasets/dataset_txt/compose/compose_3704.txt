With the current version (1.2.0 with Docker 1.6.0 on ubuntu trusty ) when trying to run the image like:
docker-compose run application_name
I'm getting the following error.
HTTPS endpoint unresponsive and insecure mode isn't enabled
The SSL certificate however is valid and the URL is correct. This is my very basic configuration:
web:
   image: example.com/application_name:latest
With docker run it pulls the image just fine:
docker run example.com/application_name:latest
Any ideas what might be causing this?
