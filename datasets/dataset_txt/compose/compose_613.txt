I did that following commands in my debian stretch vm :
#git clone https://github.com/sipcapture/homer-docker
#cd heplify-server/hom5-hep-influx
#docker-compose --verbose up
I'm having a freeze after bootstrap-mysql exited with code 0. (while docker-compose --verbose up is running)
Any ideas ? Maybe that's a bug :)
