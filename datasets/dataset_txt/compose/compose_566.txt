Compose always starts containers in dependency order
Insofar as I can tell, this doesn't mean anything useful.
And I've noticed that depends_on still introduces some delay between dependent containers.
Given that "start in order" doesn't dependably mean anything, there should be no waiting or delay in starting dependent containers. There's no point to the delay.
All containers should be started as fast as possible without waiting for dependencies.
