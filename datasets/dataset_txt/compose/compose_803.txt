I have a node app that listens on port 8000, I containerized it using following Docker file
FROM node:carbon
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install -g nodemon
RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD [ "nodemon", "start" ]
My compose file looks like this:
version: '3'
services:
  node:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: node.dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    image: console:cp
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
I have ensured the node app listens on all interfaces i.e. 0.0.0.0. But still whenever I type http://localhost:8000 it says this site cannot be reached.
When I run following inspect command to list all port bindings it returns: 8000/tcp -> 8000
docker inspect --format='{{range $p, $conf := .NetworkSettings.Ports}} {{$p}} -> {{(index $conf 0).HostPort}} {{end}}' a5c17883fd5c
Any ideas? I am pulling my hairs at the moment.
I am using docker-compose up command.
