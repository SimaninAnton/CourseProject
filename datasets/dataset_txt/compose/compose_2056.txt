Docker networks support the ip-range setting so the network doesn't overlap already existing external networks:
$ docker network create --help

Usage:  docker network create [OPTIONS] NETWORK-NAME

Creates a new network with a name specified by the user

  --aux-address=map[]      auxiliary ipv4 or ipv6 addresses used by Network driver
  -d, --driver=bridge      Driver to manage the Network
  --gateway=[]             ipv4 or ipv6 Gateway for the master subnet
  --help                   Print usage
  --internal               restricts external access to the network
  --ip-range=[]            allocate container ip from a sub-range
  --ipam-driver=default    IP Address Management Driver
  --ipam-opt=map[]         set IPAM driver specific options
  -o, --opt=map[]          set driver specific options
  --subnet=[]              subnet in CIDR format that represents a network segment
But docker compose doesn't:
version '2'

networks:
  default:
      driver: overlay
      ip-range: 192.168.240.0/21

$ docker-compose create
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
networks.default value Additional properties are not allowed ('ip-range' was unexpected)
