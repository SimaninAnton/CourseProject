I would like to use multiple -f parameter for running multiple docker-compose in one.
Example:
Project A needs Project B. There are not in the same directory.
Project A docker-compose.yml:
app:
  image: some/image
  command: /project-A-start.sh
  working_dir: /app
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  ports:
    - "3001:3000"
  links:
    - api
Project B docker-compose.yml:
api:
  image: some/other/image
  command: /project-B-start.sh
  working_dir: /app
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
So I use the command in project A:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ../project-b/docker-compose.yml up
But api container from project B does not start because command /project-B-start.sh can not be found. It appears the volume/cwd used for ../project-b/docker-compose.yml is not ../project-b but the initial directory, the project A. (Hope it's clear)
Furthermore, it turns out that it is the first -f parameter that define the directory. If I inverse the two parameter, the directory used is now project-b and now it is /project-A-start.sh that can not be found.
Is this behavior by design ? In my case the perfect behavior would be to use a separate "cwd" for each docker-compose.
Thanks for your help.
