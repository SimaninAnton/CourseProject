Found what get error is here: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose%2Fservice.py#L418 , but in my version(1.2.0), the line number is 414.
How can I get more information about where is the wrong done?
Dockerfile:
FROM python:2.7
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code
ADD requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose.yml:
web:
  volumes:
    - .:/code
  command: python run.py
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
