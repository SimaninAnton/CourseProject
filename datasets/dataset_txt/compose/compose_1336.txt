Docker swarm service creation with --publish parameter fails to create containers.
It tries respawning containers but fails with following error:
CURRENT STATE ERROR
Rejected 4 seconds ago "HNS failed with error : Unspecified error "
{More data present in attached file}.
If I create the same service without using the --publish port parameter the service runs as expected with the desired no. of tasks (containers) up and running.

Service creation with --publish command included:
docker service create --name democsvc --publish 6000:80 demoimage1
Result of Docker service ps demosvc:

If same command is executed without --publish 6000:80 option, the service is able to create and run the containers and tasks.
docker service create --name democsvc demoimage1 {Works good}
One more issue:
Exposed ports by --publish command are not accessible (IPAddress:Port should allow to communicate with the tasks of the service) from other machines present in the same network.
Running single container (Not in swarm mode) with -p Port on Host: Exposed port of container is working in the same network.
