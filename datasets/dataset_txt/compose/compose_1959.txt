After some long lines of debug output from a java application running in one of the docker containers docker-compose terminated with an overflow error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 62, in main

  File "compose\cli\log_printer.py", line 229, in consume_queue
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
docker-compose returned -1
The docker containers started by docker-compose are still running, but docker-compose terminated with the error message above.
I am using docker toolbox 12.2 on windows 10 with virtualbox. Output of docker-compose version:
