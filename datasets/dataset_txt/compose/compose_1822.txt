Hi guys,
I just noticed one can specify a .env-file for services, but not under "networks".
Why is that? I have an .env file which includes the subnet for my application and would like to use it as a variable for a network.
Example:
networks:
  example:
    env_file:
      - ./docker/dev.env
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
      - subnet: ${PROJECT_NETWORK}
It works when using the default .env in the root folder of the project, though.
