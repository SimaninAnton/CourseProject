I have a service that I just need to run once (dc run createdbs):
createdbs:
  image: postgres:9.3
  links:
    - db
  command: >
    /bin/bash -c "
      psql --host=db --username=postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE testnet;';
      psql --host=db --username=postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE livenet;';
    "
Is it possible to not have it launched every time I run docker-compose up? I have looked at alternatives for creating the databases, but I'd rather not have separate file(s) just for this.
