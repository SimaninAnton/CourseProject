Feature Request: Build image if --build is passed, alternatively pull image from registry
I don't know if this is working yet, but it would be a great feature, if you could toggle between building a image and pulling it from the registry.
So what i mean is that if you provide the --build parameter, docker compose should build the image from a Dockerfile, and if no --build is passed, the registry image (image: registry.docker.com/bla) will be used.
So for example i would use this docker-compose.yml file:
version: '3.0'
services:
  devserver:
    image: registry.docker.com/superspecialdevserver
    build: docker/devserver
    restart: always
    container_name: devserver
And the Dockerfile would be sitting in docker/devserver
