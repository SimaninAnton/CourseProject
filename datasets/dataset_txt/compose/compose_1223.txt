I need to be able fork a process. As i understand it i need to set the security-opt. I have tried doing this with docker command and it works fine. However when i do this in a docker-compose file it seem to do nothing, maybe I'm not using compose right.
Docker
docker run --security-opt=seccomp:unconfined <id> dlv debug --listen=:2345 --headless --log ./cmd/main.go
Docker-compose
Setup
docker-compose.yml
networks:
  backend:

services:
  example:
    build: .
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    networks:
      - backend
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.8

RUN go get -u github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv
RUN dlv debug --listen=:2345 --headless --log ./cmd/main.go
command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
Result
2017/09/04 15:58:33 server.go:73: Using API v1
2017/09/04 15:58:33 debugger.go:97: launching process with args: [/go/src/debug]
