I am aware of ongoing discussion about "The project name should be configurable", #45"
However, I think it should be easy to simply name and tag images and containers explicitly, like this:
ubuntu:
  build: dockerfiles/ubuntu
  image_name: nickname/ubuntu:latest
web:
  image: nickname/ubuntu:latest
  image_name: nickname/apache:2.4
  container_name:web
