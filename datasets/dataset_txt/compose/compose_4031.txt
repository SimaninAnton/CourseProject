Hi,
I am trying to move my containers to Fig. NSQD requires passing some options to Docker run command.
http://nsq.io/deployment/docker.html
Basically i should be able to pass these two options to be passed to Docker run options,
--broadcast-address=172.17.42.1 --lookupd-tcp-address=172.17.42.1:4160
Complete command:
sudo docker run -d --name nsqd -p 4150:4150 -p 4151:4151 mindnuts/nsqd --broadcast-address=172.17.42.1 --lookupd-tcp-address=172.17.42.1:4160
I tried to pass them like so, but it is not working. The nsqd container is not able to talk to the other container.
nsqd:
    build: ./Docker/nsqd
    ports:
        - "4150:4150"
        - "4151:4151"
    environment:
        broadcast-address: "172.17.42.1"
        lookupd-tcp-address: "172.17.42.1:4160"
Any help would be appreciated. Cheers!
