Docker 1.13 on Mac Sierra, with latest Docker Compose (1.11.1)
If I have a file docker-compose.yml and use the command
$ docker-compose up -d
Then it immediately starts creating the containers (I see logs like 'Creating...) , which is what I expect.
However if I use a specific file with a different name then it hangs for at least 5s before starting to create the containers.
docker-compose -f test.yml up -d
I attempted to investigate with dtruss , but it does not report any obvious difference in the operations done (I am on Mac and not accustomed to using dtruss so I might have missed something)
Is that any expected behaviour and if yes then why ?
