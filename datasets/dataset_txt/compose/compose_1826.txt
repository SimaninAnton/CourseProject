Hello,
Given docker-compose 1.9.0 and the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
kafka:
image: wurstmeister/kafka
environment:
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: ${HOSTNAME}
When I execute the following command:
ssh foo@bar.mydomain.com "docker-compose up -d
Then the hostname environment variable is not recognized. I get the following message:
The HOSTNAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
If I execute the same command on the host "bar" with the user "foo" I don't get the error. Same if I first connect with ssh, and then execute the command.
This is a major issue for us. This workflow happens in our CI.
The only workaround we found is to write the following script:
#!/bin/bash
export HOSTNAME=${HOSTNAME}
docker-compose up -d
And execute it through ssh.. Which is not handsome..
