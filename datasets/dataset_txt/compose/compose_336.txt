hello!
I recently received this Github alert on a project because I'm using a pyyaml version <4.2b1:
CVE-2017-18342
high severity
Vulnerable versions: < 4.2b1
Patched version: 4.2b1
In PyYAML before 4.1, the yaml.load() API could execute arbitrary code. In other words, yaml.safe_load is not used.
After some research it seems that it's because docker-compose require PyYAML >= 3.10, < 4 in setup.py :
compose/setup.py
Line 35 in 64633a8
 'PyYAML >= 3.10, < 4', 
Is there any contraindication to not authorize version >4 ? Thanks.
