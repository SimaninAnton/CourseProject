Issue
The following fails in Cygwin/Babun on Windows
$ docker inspect $(docker-compose ps -q cli)
Error: No such image or container: 605e85cc3dd1d6312760411e1719000c26255e2f27047508aec05c3c48314972
[]
If the id is copied and manually passed to the docker command then everything works:
$ docker inspect 605e85cc3dd1d6312760411e1719000c26255e2f27047508aec05c3c48314972

...
Cause
On Windows docker-compose spits out CRLF for line breaks.
Unfortunately the Windows docker binary won't understand CRLF.
It's worth noting that when used in Powershell, the output from docker-compose still has the CRLF line ending, but is UTF-8 encoded. The docker binary reads the input correctly in this case.
Workaround
Trim the CR(\r) character:
$ docker inspect $(docker-compose ps -q cli | tr -d '\r')
