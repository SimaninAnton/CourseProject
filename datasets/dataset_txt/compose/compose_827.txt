In Windows there is no way to build a container that requires specification of the isolation option.
If the default isolation is process(which is the default for docker), and I want to build an image based on a downlevel container then the build needs to get passed isolation=hyperv .
I see two options.
Have build inherit the isolation setting from the service.
Add isolation into the build args.
