I'm trying to run a riak cluster using docker-compose. docker-compose scale riak=5 will bring up 5 nodes in 5 containers but the containers don't link to each other. This is a deal breaker and if we will have this feature in the future I suggest an intuitive syntax like this in docker-compose.yml:
web:
    build: .
    volumes:
        - .:/usr/src/app
    links:
        - riak
riak:
    build: ./riak
    links:
        - riak
Doing this currently just bring up this error message:
A service can not link to itself: riak
Docker version: 1.8.3
Docker compose version: 1.4.2
I'm sorry if doing this is already possible. Please let me know what you think.
Thanks
