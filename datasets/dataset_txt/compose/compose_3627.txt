Hi,
I tried running my container via docker-composer with a mem_limit: 2024m setting
[tomcat@app-02 11:09:12 0 int PlaylistServiceBuild]$ docker-compose up
Recreating playlistservicebuild_configServer_1...
Cannot start container b91d396ae3c3ec49934be7e52716f0cddf317e917feec108dcd13e49b47cfeb1:  (exit status 1)
It turns out that the box didn't have enough free memory, but there's nothing to indicate this in the error code (and no logs). Would be better to throw a more descriptive error.
