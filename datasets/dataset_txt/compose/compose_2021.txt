Hi, I have an issue while running docker-compose on Windows 10 with Russian language pack:
Creating network "docker_default" with the default driver
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "logging__init__.py", line 861, in emit
File "logging__init__.py", line 734, in format
File "compose\cli\formatter.py", line 48, in format
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 24: ordinal not in range(128)
Logged from file errors.py, line 71
I don't have any non-ascii characters on my docker-compose.yml, but suppose that something like network interface name may contain non-ascii characters.
docker-compose --version
