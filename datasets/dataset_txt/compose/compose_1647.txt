While starting and stopping around 100 containers seems relatively fast (around 30s), recreating containers is painfully slow (around 6m). Judging from the CLI output and a short look at the code, it seems as if the recreation process (running up multiple times) runs in sequence, and not in parallel, like start, stop and similar commands.
Could this be addressed, or are there any underlying issues? I'm more than happy to try and put a PR together, but I did not read the entire codebase, so I am not sure of the implications.
