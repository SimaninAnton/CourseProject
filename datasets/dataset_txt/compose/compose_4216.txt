fig newcomer here, trying to set up the WordPress example.
It's unclear to me what the directory structure is from the documentation. Is it:
wordpress/
  fig.yml
  wp-config.php
  router.php
or...
fig.yml
wordpress/
  wp-config.php
  router.php
or...
fig.yml
wordpress/
wp-config.php
router.php
Running the first example, fig up simply hangs.
edit: boot2docker wasn't running, that's why it was hanging
