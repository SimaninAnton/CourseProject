Ubuntu 14.04 (on vagrant)
Installing docker on the system, which brings in docker-compose 1.10.1 package
Try to do "docker-compose build", fails:

This is a known issue (docker/docker-py#1054), but was working fine with docker-compose 1.10.0.
But this change in docker-compose 1.10.1 is causing the above error:
5895d8b#diff-228ac110a2a9f4c594407b860e1b0ed0
Specifically:
pip = __import__('pip')
This line alters the sys.path. Before that line:
sys.path: ['/usr/local/bin', '/test', '/usr/lib/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages']
After that line:
sys.path: ['/usr/share/python-wheels/setuptools-3.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/urllib3-1.7.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/html5lib-0.999-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/pip-1.5.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/requests-2.2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/distlib-0.1.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/chardet-2.2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/six-1.5.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/share/python-wheels/colorama-0.2.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl', '/usr/local/bin', '/test', '/usr/lib/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages']
Notably, the "/usr/share/python-wheels/urllib3-1.7.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl" package is added to the top of the path, making it impossible to override with PYTHONPATH or anything else later. This means request will be forced to use the older ubuntu 14.04's urllib 1.7, which breaks everything.
Downgrading to docker-compose 1.10.0 fixes this, allowing the code to use a newer urllib3 version than what's installed in the system.
