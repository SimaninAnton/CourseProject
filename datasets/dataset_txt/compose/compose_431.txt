Description of the issue
I ran the official image of centos7 and installed ssh service with my every node for the cluster。
Below is part of the docker-compose file:
version: '3'
services:
  Master:
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
    ........
  Slave1:
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
    .....
  Slave2:
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
    .....
when I used ping Slave1 commend in Master container, I can get the normal IP. But when I use ssh Slave1, I can’t get the IP. It displays ssh: Could not resolve hostname Slave2: Name or service not known.
Even more strange is I add Mapping for 1.1.1.1 Slave2 In hosts file of my host machine. Then I use ssh Slave2 in Master container, The IP that got is 1.1.1.1. why the Master container don't use own hosts file？
Then I changed service name to Lowercase letter，look like this：
services:
  master:
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
     ........
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
    ..........
  slave2:
    image: gus/spark
    ports:
    ........
Everything is ok.
