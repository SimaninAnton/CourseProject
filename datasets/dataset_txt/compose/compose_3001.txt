I'm using docker-compose build <service> and during the build process I'm getting the following error:

It's happening consistently when a RUN npm install command in my Dockerfile is about to finish up. However, it only happens when certain npm modules are installed. When I remove certain modules it runs through fine. One module I've been able to reproduce the issue with consistently is babel-preset-es2015. Whenever I have that module in my package.json file the docker-compose build command fails with the above error.
Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be?
