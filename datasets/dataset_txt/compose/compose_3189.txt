Using docker-compose version 1.4.2 the execution of the build command fails if the underlying directory name contains non-ascii characters. In the example below I use the u-umlaut character, which is in extended ascii and is common in several European languages.
A minimal working example is below:
$ mkdir F端端
$ cd F端端/
$ touch docker-compose.yml
$ $ cat << EOF > docker-compose.yml
web:
  build: .
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"

EOF
$ touch Dockerfile
$ docker-compose build
Building web...
