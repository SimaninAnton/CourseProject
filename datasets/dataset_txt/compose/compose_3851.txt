Context
I have :
a local docker client setup to talk to my local swarm manager
a local swarm manager setup to talk to 2 remote nodes node1 and node2
the remote nodes runs a docker daemon binded on a specific ip:port.
What I do
When using my local docker client I can manage my remote containers via swarm without any problem.
But then I have started using compose...
What I get
Everything is fine at first docker-compose up -d run, but then almost every re-run I get this kind of error :
Cannot start container 340e6fb486471188187308b56b3122ec674f2dde8fad77c7f8532c096a074abb: container 1c90731f5d12ce0752e3e60a575e17259f46794fa88745eba65917eb2d7e32c2 not found, impossible to mount its volumes
Searching around it turns out the first sha1 "xxxxx" is on node1 while the sha1 "yyyyy" is on node2 (!)
What I expected
Well... I'd like every layer to be created on the same node.
What I think
I'll dig into it later but I think it's an issue with the constraint:key==value environment variable
