Given a setup like this:
% cat docker-compose.yml
test:
    extends:
        file: docker/common-compose.yml
        service: testapp
    env_file: docker/environment
    command: env
% cat docker/common-compose.yml
testapp:
    image: ubuntu:14.04
% cat docker/environment
TEST_ENVIRONMENT="This won't show up."
% docker-compose run --rm test
# No TEST_ENVIRONMENT.
%
If the env_file entry is moved to docker/common-compose.yml, then the environment variable is set properly. This sounds like a bug to me.
