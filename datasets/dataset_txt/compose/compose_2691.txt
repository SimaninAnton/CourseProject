maybe I'm tripping but I thought this docker/swarm#251 was going to/had been be fixed by the new overlay networking support
I've gone through a round of upgrading everything to the latest docker versions
the mem_limit in my compose yml works now, but as a result I can't start my entire set of containers... due to large amount being (correctly) allocated for one of them
$ docker info

nginx is up-to-date

oceania_elasticsearch_1 is up-to-date
Creating oceania_myapp_1
ERROR: no resources available to schedule container
there's a big allocation for the elasticsearch, then it gets stuck trying to start the next one instead of scheduling it to the empty node
I have:
version: 2

networks:
  oceania:
    driver: overlay

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    container_name: nginx
    networks:
      - oceania

  redis:
    image: redis
    networks:
      - oceania
    expose:
      - 6379
    restart: unless-stopped

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:1.7.4
    networks:
      - oceania
    expose:
      - 9200
      - 9300
    mem_limit: 1G
    restart: unless-stopped

etc
Am I trying to do something that's not possible yet? Or something is broken in my swarm?
