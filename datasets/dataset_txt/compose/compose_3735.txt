I have a docker-compose.yml file along the lines of:
analytics:
    build: .
    links:
    - mongo:mongo
    ports:
    - 80:80
mongo:
    build: docker_containers/mongo
    expose:
    - 27017
Running docker-compose up creates a link in /etc/hosts to the mongo service. However, running docker-compose run analytics bash does not create the link -- I checked the /etc/hosts file.
The docs of docker-compose do not mention anything about this, so I'm confused.
Why isn't the link set when using run?
How can I achieve this?
