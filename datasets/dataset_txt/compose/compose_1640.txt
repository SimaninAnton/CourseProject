docker-compose run:
Run a one-off command on a service.

For example:

    $ docker-compose run web python manage.py shell

By default, linked services will be started, unless they are already
running. If you do not want to start linked services, use
`docker-compose run --no-deps SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]`.

Usage: run [options] [-p PORT...] [-e KEY=VAL...] SERVICE [COMMAND] [ARGS...]

Options:
    -d                    Detached mode: Run container in the background, print
                          new container name.
    --name NAME           Assign a name to the container
    --entrypoint CMD      Override the entrypoint of the image.
    -e KEY=VAL            Set an environment variable (can be used multiple times)
    -u, --user=""         Run as specified username or uid
    --no-deps             Don't start linked services.
    --rm                  Remove container after run. Ignored in detached mode.
    -p, --publish=[]      Publish a container's port(s) to the host
    --service-ports       Run command with the service's ports enabled and mapped
                          to the host.
    -T                    Disable pseudo-tty allocation. By default `docker-compose run`
                          allocates a TTY.
    -w, --workdir=""      Working directory inside the container
docker-compose exec:
Execute a command in a running container

Usage: exec [options] SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]

Options:
    -d                Detached mode: Run command in the background.
    --privileged      Give extended privileges to the process.
    --user USER       Run the command as this user.
    -T                Disable pseudo-tty allocation. By default `docker-compose exec`
                      allocates a TTY.
    --index=index     index of the container if there are multiple
                      instances of a service [default: 1]
Why doesn't exec support environment command? Documentation for docker-compose exec reads "This is equivalent of docker exec." And documentation for docker exec DOES list --env parameter.
