I have a simple docker-compose.yml file
version: '2'

services:
  test:
     image: centos:6.7
     entrypoint: echo
     command: echo From compose
Now below is the command i execute
[root@localhost test-compose]# docker-compose run test
echo From compose
[root@localhost test-compose]# docker-compose run test this is best
this is best
[root@localhost test-compose]# docker-compose run --entrypoint "" test /bin/bash
/bin/bash
[root@localhost test-compose]# docker-compose run --entrypoint /bin/bash test
/bin/echo: /bin/echo: cannot execute binary file
[root@localhost test-compose]# docker-compose run --entrypoint /bin/bash test ""
/bin/echo: /bin/echo: cannot execute binary file
As you can see I am not able to get into bash any how. I am using Docker 1.11.1. If any more is needed please let me know
