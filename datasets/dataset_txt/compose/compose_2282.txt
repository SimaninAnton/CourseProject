Hello.
I am using the Docker and Docker Compose in OS X and need to use the SOCKS proxy to reach remote Docker Engines. And looks like Docker Compose doesn't support it despite Docker does.
My environment is the following:
bash-3.2$ uname -a
Darwin myhost 15.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 15.5.0: Tue Apr 19 18:36:36 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.50.21~8/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64


bash-3.2$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      1.11.2
 API version:  1.23
 Go version:   go1.5.4
 Git commit:   b9f10c9
 Built:        Wed Jun  1 21:20:08 2016
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      1.11.1
 API version:  1.23
 Go version:   go1.5.4
 Git commit:   5604cbe
 Built:        Wed Apr 27 00:34:42 2016
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64


bash-3.2$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
docker-py version: 1.8.1
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1j 15 Oct 2014
Please, consider the following actions:
Docker supports the ALL_PROXY environment variable:
bash-3.2$ ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:31457 docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
Docker Compose doesn't:
bash-3.2$ ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:31457 docker-compose ps
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
And in case of HTTPS_PROXY environment variable usage we get another error:
bash-3.2$ HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://localhost:31457 docker-compose ps
