I have config:
version: '2'
services:
    db: 
        image: "mysql/mysql-server:5.6"
        environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
    server:
        image: "php:5.6-apache"
        command: a2enmod vhost_alias 
        ports:
         - "80:80"
        links:
         - db:mysql
I want to enable vhost_alias for apache2, but command doesn't execute. I'm trying example from documentation, from stackoverflow: bash -c and e.t.c
Could you explain how it works and give me tip how to execute command like a2enmod vhost_alias without prepare dockerfile?
