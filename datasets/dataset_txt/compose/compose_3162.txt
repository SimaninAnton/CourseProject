Running through the same example in #2279 on Docker Swarm with --x-network-driver overlay
I have big problems after up -d && stop && rm
When I bring up my compose file again...
Instead of re-using the network (as happens in the single host use case), Compose creates a new network with the same name!
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                        DRIVER
bf7b620324cd        swl-demo0/bridge            bridge
c95de382559f        swl-demo0/none              null
6969ca97b168        swl-demo1/host              host
088077f4f115        counter                     overlay
1da7cb004cc3        swl-demo0/host              host
80b98c58f67d        swl-demo1/none              null
ad8432162868        swl-demo1/docker_gwbridge   bridge
1d63fedd167f        swl-demo1/bridge            bridge
2f0520ac885e        counter                     overlay
f8702a176805        swl-demo0/docker_gwbridge   bridge
I cannot do this manually with Swarm on the CLI as I get an error
$ docker network create -d overlay counter
Error response from daemon: 500 Internal Server Error: network with name counter already exists
Not sure if this is a Swarm issue, or a Compose one... but hoping we can figure it out soon!
