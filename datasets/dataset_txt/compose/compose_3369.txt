Hi,
I encountered an issue when using docker-compose version 1.4.0.
Let me try to explain it by describing the different steps I took.
Create a Dockerfile with the following content:
FROM debian

VOLUME /test

CMD ls -la /test
Create a docker-compose.yml file in the same directory with the following content:
test:
    build: .
Run the following commands:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
The ls command should return zero files which is correct
Now create a testsrc directory with a file in it and update the docker-compose.yml file to:
test:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./testsrc:/test
Run docker-compose up again and you will see that the test directory in the container is still empty. This behaviour is unexpected and in my opinion incorrect.
Run docker-compose rm and docker-compose up and the result is correct. One file available in the volume on the container.
Removing the volumes line from the docker-compose.yml file will still result in one file available in the container when you don't execute the docker-compose rm command.
If this is not a bug it think the behaviour should be clearly explained in the docs.
Regards,
Geert
