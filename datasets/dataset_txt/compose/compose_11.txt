Description of the issue
docker-compose run fails to run when non-empty ".env" file is present, printing TypeError: environment can only contain strings. docker-compose up works correctly.
This started happening when I upgraded today from older Docker Desktop release with docker-compose 1.24.0.

Output of docker-compose config
services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu:bionic
version: '2.1'
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create docker-compose.yml file:
version: '2.1'
services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu:bionic
Create .env file:
A=a
(I made sure that it contains only these three characters, i.e. 41 3D 61)
3. Run docker-compose run ubuntu - fails with "TypeError: environment can only contain strings". Removing/emptying this file letsdocker-compose to run correctly.
Observed result
Fails to start
Expected result
Runs container using environment variables from .env
