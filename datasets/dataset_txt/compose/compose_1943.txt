Hi I am beginner in elasticsearch, I am trying to run elasticsearch on ubuntu14.04 .
elasticsearch-docker.yml
`
  version "2"
  services:  
    els:
      image: elasticsearch:latest
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
      - "9300:9300"
    volumes:
      - "./config/elasticsearch.yml:/etc/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml"          
    #command: bash -c "service elasticsearch start" # Command is now working in version 2
    tty: true`
As per above yml file without 'command' this is working, means without command it is pulling elastic search image if it is not there. $ docker-compose up working fine.
$ docker pa -a
CONTAINER ID COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS b5cb2s34d elasticsearch:latest 10 sec up 0.0.0.0:9200-->9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300-->9300/tcp
It showing all port forwarding is working fine.
I didn't modified or made changes in /config/elasticsearch.yml
but while testing it not working:
http://localhost:9200 or using curl
Its not working because elasticsearch service is not running inside docker container but whenever I coment out command tag in docker-compose.yml file i.e. command: bash -c "service elasticsearch start" then its set all port forwarding and up the container but service inside container i.e 'elasticsearch service' is not running.
So how to Explicitly pass command i.e. command: bash -c "service elasticsearch start" in docker-compose.yml
so how to run only Elasticsearch by using docker-compose.yml using version 2**?**
Docker-compose version : 1.9
Docker version: 1.12
