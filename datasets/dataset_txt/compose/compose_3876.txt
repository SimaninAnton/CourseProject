I would like to target docker-compose to docker swarm host but looks like there is no -H option to specify with docker-compose.
If I could specify the docker host with docker-compose, I do not need to change the docker config file. Docker-compose may target swarm but other tools (say docker CLI itself) can use regular local unix socket.
