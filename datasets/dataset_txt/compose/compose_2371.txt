Hi,
I'm using docker toolbox for Windows (docker v1.11.1, compose v1.7.1).
My docker-compose.yml looks like this :
version: '2'

services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu
    networks:
      test:
        ipv4_address: 172.16.238.10
    command: sleep 1000

networks:
  test:
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade: "false"
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
      - subnet: 172.16.238.0/24
        gateway: 172.16.238.1
Then when I try to execute a command with docker-compose run, i get the next error :
$ docker-compose run -d ubuntu ls
Address already in use
I guess it is because I use a static IP for the container but we should be able to use docker-compose run anyway.
Is it a bug or is there a way to make it work ?
Thanks for your help !
