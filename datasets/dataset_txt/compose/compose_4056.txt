This may be a problem with my image but I wonder what to look for
I have these services defined:
postgres:
  image: kartoza/postgis
  volumes_from:
    - postgresdata
  expose:
    - 5432

postgresdata:
  image: dockerfile/ubuntu
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/postgresql
I fig up... all good
$ fig restart postgres
Restarting anentropic_postgres_1...
all good. nothing logged in the fig up window
$ fig restart postgres
Restarting anentropic_postgres_1...
this time in the other window I see:
anentropic_postgres_1 exited with code -1
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping anentropic_nginx_1...
Stopping anentropic_dpm_1...
Stopping anentropic_postgres_1...
happens repeatably if I fig up again
it seems to me if it was something going wrong in the CMD then it should happen the first time you restart as well
