Sometimes you deal with multipurpose monolithic applications that need multiple background processes to work (such as Django + Celery), and you should be able to start and stop those processes by calling docker-compose up and down, without having to run multiple services.
I see two ways of implement this:
Allow multiple commands per service
Allow build a service from another service
Particularly, I think that another service makes more sense:
version: "2"

base-service:
  build:
     dockerfile: MyDockerfile
     context: .
  # CMD is already set on MyDockerfile
  # Lots of env, ports, etc

support-service:
  build:
    service: base-service
  command: some command -D
