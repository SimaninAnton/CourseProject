I'm running docker-compose cli inside a Cygwin Terminal.
The logs produced after running docker-compose up as well as docker-compose logs -f do not stop after terminating the processes with Ctrl-C.
Things I noticed (they apply to both commands):
After running docker-compose up, ps in cygwin terminal shows 1 docker-compose command, while powershell shows 2 docker-compose commands.
Cygwin Terminal
PID PPID PGID WINPID TTY UID STIME COMMAND
2616 13476 2616 11436 pty0 197609 14:23:07 /usr/bin/docker-compose
Powershell
ProcessID ParentProcessID CommandLine
2616 13080 "C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe"
11436 2616 C:\cygwin64\bin\docker-compose up
408 11436 C:\cygwin64\bin\docker-compose up
Ctrl-C kills the Cygwin process, instantly releases the prompt, but won't actually stop the logs nor will kill the process. The signal appears to never propagate to docker-compose up as it continues normally, without ever attempting to stop gracefully. After Ctrl-C, Cygwin Terminal no longer sees a docker-compose process, while Powershell still has the following:
ProcessID ParentProcessID CommandLine
408 11436 C:\cygwin64\bin\docker-compose up
Why is this happening?
