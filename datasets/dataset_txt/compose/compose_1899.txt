Usually, if I launch docker-compose up -d, it will build all images, then create all of them in order mentioned in depends_on chain of docker-compose.yml.
What if approach with launching one by one will let remove "wait-for-it.sh" scripts. Time of start MySQL is near 5 minutes. Build of container usually takes even more.
Not important to know when container has been started.
Much more important to know when service become is up and ready to work.
Change order of build & create in docker-compose. Allow order, not only build 1, build 2, build 3, create 1, create2, create3, but build1&create1, build3&create3, build2&create2.
Upgrade depends_on for waiting opening port (this data exists in docker-compose.yml)
while ! curl --output /dev/null --silent --head --fail http://172.25.0.1:3306; do sleep 1 && echo -n .; done;
Finally we have time economy, cause while one container is building, previous already start to initialize.
It allow put logic of Symfony project with Fixtures loading after MySQL is up.
