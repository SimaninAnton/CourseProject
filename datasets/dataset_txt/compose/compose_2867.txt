I am pretty sure this is related to #622, and you were asking for a use-case for it, and I think I've got one.
The issue here is that new volumes aren't being properly attached to containers if the containers were already running.
Reduced test case
Gists don't allow subdirectories, but the --SLASH-- represents... well, a / (a subdirectory division).

Anyway, have the above files in this structure:
├── data
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── index.html
├── docker-compose.yml
└── server
    └── Dockerfile
Steps to reproduce
Step 1: Run:
docker-compose up -d
Step 2: Visit http://localhost:8080/ (don't forget to replace localhost with your Docker Machine's IP if you need to) and you should see Hello World!
Step 3: Change the contents of data/index.html to Hello Compose! then run:
Step 4: Rebuild data:
docker-compose build data
Step 5: Start up data?
docker-compose up data
Step 6: Refresh http://localhost:8080/.
Results
Expected: Hello Compose!
Actual: Hello World!
Addendum
You can replace Step 5 with any of these and you get the same result:
Step 5 alt (a)
docker-compose up -d
Step 5 alt (b)
docker-compose restart
Step 5 alt (c)
docker-compose rm -f data
docker-compose up data
Step 5 alt (d)
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
Workaround
The following does work, but it will restart server, and the goal here would be to not have any down time:
Step 5 alt (e)
docker-compose rm -f data
docker-compose up -d
