➜  projectname docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9
Having a strange problem when simply changing a volume's mount name.
My configuration looks like this:
version: '3.4'
services:
  cygnetise:
    image: someorg/projectname
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: projectname_client
        target: /app
  nginx:
    image: someorg/projectname-nginx
    ports:
      - target: 80
        published: 8080
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: projectname_client
        target: /mnt/projectname_client
        read_only: true
volumes:
  projectname_client:
  projectname_admin:
If I change the nginx application's target location to /home/app/projectname_client I get the following error:
➜  projectname docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
Recreating 12396073747d_projectname_nginx_1 ...

Not sure why this would happen, and the error message doesn't really provide any useful pointers unfortunately.
