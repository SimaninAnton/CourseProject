Description of the issue
When running docker-compose up, the Compose file is falsely flagged as invalid when using ip_range in ipam.config with this error:
networks.default.ipam.config value Additional properties are not allowed ('ip_range' was unexpected)
Despite being documented as a valid option: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#ipam
