I'm trying to use fig to assemble our application and have run into a use case that I don't see supported at the moment: I need to have a service that has 2 links to the same container, like so:
links:
  - db:db
  - db:legacydb
The reason is that in some environments those are 2 different containers but in a dev environment they're set up as one.
Is this something that is coming down the road for fig?
