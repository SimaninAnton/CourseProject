I have been trying to run simple container with adding dns servers like
     dns: 172.17.0.1
and also
     dns: 
       - 172.17.0.1
       - 8.8.8.8
In both cases I get the output from compose like
ERROR: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type []string
Docker engine is
Containers: 6
Images: 180
Server Version: 1.9.1
Storage Driver: aufs
 Root Dir: /var/lib/docker/aufs
 Backing Filesystem: extfs
 Dirs: 192
 Dirperm1 Supported: true
Execution Driver: native-0.2
Logging Driver: json-file
Kernel Version: 3.19.0-30-generic
Operating System: Ubuntu 15.04
CPUs: 2
Total Memory: 3.36 GiB
and compose is just downloaded.
Has anyone seen this before ?
