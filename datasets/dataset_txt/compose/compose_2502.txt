If NetworkSettings.Networks is None when trying to run a container, this fails because in compose/service.py:453, connected_network may be None(or does it?) when assigned. Because connected_network is used in an __contains__ check later on, a TypeError is raised.
This happens using docker-compose v. 1.6.2dev as well as a cloned version using commit:f10bc8072ed9e2b043cf3dae602a03143858b712
Used .yml: https://github.com/lukasjuhrich/sipa/blob/docker_compose_failure/testing.yml
Used Dockerfile: https://github.com/lukasjuhrich/sipa/blob/docker_compose_failure/Dockerfile
It seems suspicious to me that there don't exist any Networks in the NetworkSettings. If I can debug things further, please guide me concerning how to debug this, since I do not know a lot about docker{,compose} internals (I know some things about python though).

I hope I did provide enough information. I could open up a PR with an if-none-return check once it is confirmed this is a bug. For including a test I might need some guidance.
