Hi
I noticed that the pid option in version 3 of compose file has only one allowed value "host":
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#pid
In ver2 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#pid) it is possibile to use "container" and "service" as well.
I created ver3 compose file and I see that it's still possible to use "pid: "service:foobar"" - it works exactly the same as in ver2.
The question is: are the "container" and "service" keywords still supported and this is just a problem with the documentation or is this functionality deprecated?
