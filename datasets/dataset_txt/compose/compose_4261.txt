For some services I'm running from containers I need to set a listen-address to something other than localhost. Unfortunately it doesn't let me set a wildcard IP address to listen on all interfaces. And it's in a configuration plaintext file, so environment variables won't help me here.
There should be some way to set the IP address of the generated container, either from the command line or from fig.yml.
