Problem. docker-compose logs doesnt work for services started with docker-compose run
Docker version 18.09.6, build 481bc77
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880f
Reproduce:
Start a service with detached mode
docker-compose run -d service1
Now try to view the logs
docker-compose logs service1_generated_name
Results in ERROR: No such service:
How do we get logs for this kind of service?
