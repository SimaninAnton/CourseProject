When using the link option in docker compose (either in V1.9 or V2), the linking seems not set on build time.
I'm using the database host in installation script executed by myapp entrypoint. Thus I set up the installation to point on jdbc:mysql://database:3306/DEMO.
When executing the dockerfile of myapp, the /etc/hosts does not contain the entry for database.
After installation (failed) when running the container, the /etc/hosts is properly set.
Is this the regular behavior ?
Can I achieve using the virtual hostname ?
It would be nice to allow such linking at build time.
e.g. with V1.9
database:
  image: mariadb:latest
  container_name: mycontainer
  ports:
    - "3306:3306"
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_ROOT_PASS}
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=DEMO
    - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USER}
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASS}

myapp
  # here on build time I cannot access database server via "database". I'm forced to use the internal ip.
  build: .
  container_name: myapp
  links:
      - database:database
In addition, ENV listing on build time does not contains values set by the linking.
Note: for V2 I tried replacing links by depends_on but without better result.
