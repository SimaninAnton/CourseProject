The official docs show docker network is capable of specifying the subnet, gateway, and a few other things.
network supports subnet, gateway, and a few other other things.
The schema only defines subnet and explicitly states there are no additionalProperties.
This docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  illustrate_network_issue:
    image: alpine:latest
    networks:
      broken_config:

networks:
  broken_config:
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: '10.47.0.0/24'
          gateway: '10.47.0.254'
leads to this error:
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
networks.broken_config.ipam.config value Additional properties are not allowed ('gateway' was unexpected)
