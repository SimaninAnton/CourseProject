Given the following docker-compose
db:
  image: mysql:latest
  ports: 
   - "3306:3306"
  environment:
   - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=docker

wheelmap:
  build: .
  links:
   - db
   - db:db
I'd expect the wheelmap container to have an /etc/hosts entry like
172.17.0.26    db
However, I get
172.17.0.26     wheelmap_db_1
172.17.0.26     wheelmap_db_1.bridge
172.17.0.46     condescending_swartz
172.17.0.46     condescending_swartz.bridge
instead. These names don't look like they're going to be stable, and they don't match the documentation, which says:
links
Link to containers in another service. Either specify both the service name and the link alias (SERVICE:ALIAS), or just the service name (which will also be used for the alias).

links:
 - db
 - db:database
 - redis
An entry with the aliasâ€™ name will be created in /etc/hosts inside containers for this service, e.g:

172.17.2.186  db
172.17.2.186  database
172.17.2.187  redis
