If I have a basic docker compose compose config as follows, and run docker-compose up -d db, then later run docker-compose up -d --no-recreate api, the api container does not appear to actually be linked to the db, and none of the expected environment variables are present in the api instance.
data:
  build: docker/api-data/
db:
  build: docker/db/
  volumes_from:
    - data
api:
  build: .
  links:
    - db:db
  volumes:
    - ./:/app
  volumes_from:
    - data
