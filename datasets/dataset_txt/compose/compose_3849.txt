We hit this issue when using docker-compose run on Jenkins to run integration tests.
echo -e "main:\n  image: hello-world" > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose run main < /dev/null
produces no output at all. Adding -T makes no difference.
A hack to work around the issue (on OSX), sometimes prints only a character "H", sometimes the proper output:
echo -e "main:\n  image: hello-world" > docker-compose.yml
script -q /dev/null docker-compose run main < /dev/null
The same on Linux:
echo -e "main:\n  image: hello-world" > docker-compose.yml
script -q -c "docker-compose run main" /dev/null < /dev/null
