Installing docker-compose through pip will sometimes(?) not upgrade websocket to required version. This means:
User uses pip install docker-compose.
User tries to use it. This error appears:

3 . User needs to google around and dig for this error to find out that this is required to make things work: sudo pip install -U websocket
This is not exactly how the install experience is supposed to be. Why does this not work properly per default? Also check out #1288 to see that it's a quite a large amount of people affected.
Please figure out why pip isn't properly installing the required websocket dependency, and make it work per default for all users.
