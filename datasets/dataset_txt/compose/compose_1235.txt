Hello guys,
I've been reading at several places that the push/pull from docker-compose to private repositories has been implemented but I cannot make it work.
Some reproducible steps:
$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.15.0, build e12f3b9
docker-py version: 2.4.2
CPython version: 2.7.12
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j  26 Sep 2016
$ docker login registry.company.com
Username (company):

$ docker pull registry.company.com/documentation
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from documentation

If there is some special steps to have this working, I think having it on an issue/documentation would help next users to find the solution. If there is some additions to make it work, could you point to relevant starting points?
