Hi guys!
I'm working on CentOS 6.7 and want to install docker-engine and docker-compose just for some small tests. I installed docker-engine 1.7.1 and the version of docker-compose is 1.6.2
The point is after installing docker-compose using pip, i couln't check the version or using it.
Here's the output:
[root@ip-10-0-7-77 ~]# docker-compose --version Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/bin/docker-compose", line 5, in <module> from pkg_resources import load_entry_point File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 2655, in <module> working_set.require(__requires__) File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 648, in require needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements)) File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 546, in resolve raise DistributionNotFound(req) pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: jsonschema>=2.5.1,<3
