I have docker-compose.yml file in folder nowsd:
version: 2
volumes:
  data:
    driver: local
  ugc:
    driver: local
services:
  web:
    image: busybox
    volumes:
      - data:/var/log
      - ugc:/var/ugc
$ docker-compose up
Starting nowsd_web_1
Attaching to nowsd_web_1
nowsd_web_1 exited with code 0
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               nowsd_data
local               data
local               ugc
local               nowsd_ugc
You can see that two extra unscoped volumes has been created. When I inspect container nowsd_web_1 i can see that volumes data and ugc are attached to container instead of nowsd_data and nowsd_ugc respectively.
