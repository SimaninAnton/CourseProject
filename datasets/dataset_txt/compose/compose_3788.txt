Hi there,
I recently installed the version 1.2.0rc1. I have a nodejs application that will poll an API every five minutes.
The docker-compose.yml is the following
publibike:
  image: softengheigvd/iflux-publibike-event-source:v0.1.0
  env_file: ./.env
This is something really light and working well with 1.1.0.
But with the version 1.2.0rc1, I was not able to make the network working. I mean the polling process cannot reach the Internet from the container. I tried to run my image manually with Docker and it works. I tried to use net: bridge in the docker-compose file without effect.
Then I also tried to use net: host, with this config, it worked.
Do I miss something in the configuration somewhere ? At the moment, I reinstalled Compose version 1.1.0 and it works like a charm for what I need.
Thanks
