I'm running Docker 1.13.0-rc4 and current master (545153f) of Compose.
I tried to deploy a stack using following docker-compose.yml file:
version: "3"
services:
  base:
    image: hello-world
  extending:
    extends: base
    labels:
      - "label=test"
Got following in response:
$ docker stack deploy --compose-file ./docker-compose.yml test
Compose file contains unsupported options:

extends: Support for `extends` is not implemented yet. Use `docker-compose config` to generate a configuration with all `extends` options resolved, and deploy from that.
I found an issue about it in Docker's repo (moby/moby#29304) and attempted to run the command given by the error message, which resulted in:
$ docker-compose config
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for services.extending: 'extends'
