Description of the issue
We have a docker-compose.yml which is used to build many images. Some of those images also use a disposable but cacheable "builder" image.
We want to push some of those images to AWS ECR.
The only images are the non builder ones.
For example
  nginx-base:
    image: XXX.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-base:release-production

  ms-builder:
    build:
      [...]
    image: ms-builder:release-${id}
The idea is to use
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.base-images.yml push
and only push the ones tagged with ECR
But by default, docker will assume docker.io as the default registry, and prepend that to the images name, trying to push the builders to docker.io, leading to a fail
We have been fallbacking to --ignore-push-failures but that will not makes aware if a valid image fails to push.
Would it be possible to tag images with some prefix that would make docker push skip them?
something like local/ms-builder:release-${id}
