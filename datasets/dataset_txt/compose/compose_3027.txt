I'm running docker-compose up using the configuration:
couchbase-syncgateway:
  image: couchbase/sync-gateway
  command: /usr/local/bin/sync_gateway /config/config.json
  volumes:
  - ~/sync-gateway:/config
  expose:
  - "4984"
  - "4985"
  ports:
  - "4984:4984"
  - "4985:4985"
I need to override the default command of the sync-gateway image because I need to provide a different config.json file, so I've put the file on a folder in my host and tried to override this default command pointing to the file using volumes, but when I execute docker-compose up, It fails with the mentioned error.
What I'm missing? Thanks!
