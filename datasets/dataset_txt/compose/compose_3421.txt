My docker-compose.yml :
www:
  build: .
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  command: /app/docker-entrypoint.sh
After renaming a parent directory from "/home/samber/projects/XXX/scope" to "/home/samber/projects/YYY/scope", every docker-compose up was broken :
$ docker-compose logs www
Attaching to scope_www_1
www_1 | /bin/sh: 1: /app/docker-entrypoint.sh: not found
Compose seems to put in a cache the volume path ("." = pwd) :
$ docker inspect scope_www_1
[...]
"Volumes": {
        "/app": "/home/samber/projects/XXX/scope"
    },
[...]
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version: 1.3.3
CPython version: 2.7.8
$ docker -v
Docker version 1.6.2.fc21, build c3ca5bb/1.6.2
IMO compose should read the docker-compose.yml at each command.
