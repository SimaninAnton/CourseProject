I was checking my config, when I noticed that my service
  sftp:
    container_name: sftp
    build: ./compose/sftp
    image: mp5/sftp
    ports:
      - 2122:22
    volumes:
      - af_www_htdocs:/htdocs/af_www
turns into
  sftp:
    build:
      context: /home/user/server/compose/sftp
    container_name: sftp
    image: mp5/sftp
    ports:
    - 127342
    volumes:
    - af_www_htdocs:/htdocs/af_www:rw
when going through docker-compose config. This is the only publishing that maps two different ports on host and container, and all the others (say, 22:22, 80:80, 443:443) go through unchanged. Am I missing something?
