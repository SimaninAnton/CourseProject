After updating docker compose from version 1.17.1 to version 1.18.0-rc1 has been appeared error:
ERROR: for php_php72_1  Cannot create container for service php72: invalid mount config for type "bind": invalid mount path: 'web' mount path must be absolute

ERROR: for php72  Cannot create container for service php72: invalid mount config for type "bind": invalid mount path: 'web' mount path must be absolute
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
I use long syntax for bind mounts. If this change to short syntax everything works well
My docker-compose.yml file contents:
version: '3.4'

services:
  php72:
    image: php:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./web
        target: /var/www/html/
    command: ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:8080", "-t", "/var/www/html"]
