I have installed the Docker 1.13.1 stable version for windows 10 Pro.
Docker version details :
Version 1.13.1 (10072)
Channel: Stable
94675c5
When I tried to copy the docker-stack.yml to VM that I have created for voting app below is the docker document url.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted-voting-app/deploy-app/
I wrote the below command to copy from my host to VM machine but it gives error
"You must have a copy of the scp binary locally to use the scp feature".
C:\Windows\system32>docker-machine scp ~/sandbox/voting-app/docker-stack.yml manager:/home/docker/.
You must have a copy of the scp binary locally to use the scp feature
I checked docker-machine --help and able to find this command but still it is not working.
below is the output for docker-machine help from command prompt of windows 10.
