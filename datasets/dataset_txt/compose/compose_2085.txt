We can try and detect the type of daemon compose is connected to and normalize paths accordingly. I don't know if this is even possible, and it creates additional network roundtrips that will make Compose feel slower in some environments.
We do not normalize by default, and create additional documentation to inform non-native users of the format they should employ. This would be a breaking change, but is much simpler to implement.
