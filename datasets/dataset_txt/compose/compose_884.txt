If I run docker run -td --rm --name mycontainer myimage bash it boots up, daemonizes the container and return the container id. No problem.
Running docker ps confirms it's up and running.
If I run docker-compose run -d --rm --name mycontainer myservice bash it boots up, daemonizes the container and returns the container name. No problem.
Running docker ps confirms it's not up and running at all, but exited immediately.
Why is this?
