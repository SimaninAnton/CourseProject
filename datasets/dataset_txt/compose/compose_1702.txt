Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs.
docker-compose is very particular about the ordering of arguments and parameters. It would be nicer if it was more flexible, like most *NIX commands are.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Run any command against a service that takes arguments (e.g. tailing logs), but place the arguments after the service name
docker-compose logs mycontainer -f
Describe the results you received:
> docker-compose logs mycontainer -f
ERROR: No such service: -f
Describe the results you expected:
Argument position should be irrelevant to running a command. In the example above, I would expect compose to tail/follow the logs for the container mycontainer.
