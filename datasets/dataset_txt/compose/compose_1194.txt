I have both docker-compose.yml and its override file. The essential part of the content is:
docker-compose.yml:
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - "../app:/var/www/drupal:ro"
docker-compose.override.yml:
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - "../app:/var/www/drupal:rw"
      - "./environments/local/data/composer:/home/developer/.composer:rw"
For some reason the override for ../app doesn't work - it is mounted in ro mode. But if comment out the second line (- "./environments/local/data/composer:/home/developer/.composer:rw") all of a sudden it starts seeing the override and works correctly. I don't see any logic in this behavior. Any ideas?
