I created Dockerfile and fig.yml and executed "sudo fig up" but it is throwing this error. I have a simple django app ending with.
CMD python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Here's my fig file.
web:
  build: .
  volumes:
    - .:/opt/myapp
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
I tested sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 myapp_web_1 and it is working but fig is not working.
