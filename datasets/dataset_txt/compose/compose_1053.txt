Today I can't see a way to externalize the name of a secret referenced in a compose file. It must be statically declared in the compose file. Instead I should be able to do the below (same as w/ external network names)
EXISTING BEHAVIOR
services:
  app:
      secrets:
        - my_hardwired_secret_name

...

secrets:
  my_hardwired_secret_name:
    external: true
DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
services:
  app:
      secrets:
        - some_secret_alias

...

secrets:
  some_secret_alias:
    external: 
       name: ${SECRET_NAME_1}
