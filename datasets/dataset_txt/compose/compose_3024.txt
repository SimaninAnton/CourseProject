If you have a base configuration like this one ...
baseservice:
  build: path/to/compose/file
  command: /bin/false
  environment:
    AN_ENVIRONMENT_VAR: 1234

service1:
  extends:
    file: docker-compose.yml
    service: baseservice
  command: some command
  environment:
    PULL_FROM_HOST:
And service1 has the environment var AN_ENVIRONMENT_VAR set but PULL_FROM_HOST will always come back as None no matter if it's set in the host. If you remove the extends part of service1 then the PULL_FROM_HOST environment variable works. It's like the dictionary merging process broke.
