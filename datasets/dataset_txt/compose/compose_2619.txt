In a swarm environment, volumes_from fails to see a container or service not listed in the compose file itself.
It's best explained with a simple example. I start with two swarm nodes (node01, node02). Consul is used for service disco.
docker network create -d overlay backbone
docker run --name vault --net backbone -v data:/stuff alpine:3.3 /bin/true
docker-compose up -d with the following file
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    image: alpine:3.3
    volumes_from:
      - vault
    networks:
      - backbone
    command: /bin/true

networks:
  backbone:
    external: true
This results in
ERROR: Service "app" mounts volumes from "vault", which is not the name of a service or container.
I get the same result if I create a second compose file to define a vault service and backbone networks before executing the above compose file.
I've also toyed with external_links without success.
A similar but simpler issue was explained here #1972. In that case, the service referenced by volumes_from is defined in the same compose file.
