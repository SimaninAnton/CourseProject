docker run has the flag --cidfile <file> that writes the container id to the specefied file so that it is possible to read it for other purposes.
It should be a option in the config for one image
web:
  image: mysql:latest
  cidfile: /tmp/mysql.cid
...
Supporting this might be a simpler solution to build before exec command is supported (as discussed in #593)
