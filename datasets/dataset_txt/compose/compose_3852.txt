A fairly common use case on our team is to keep docker-compose.yml in source control, but custom dev setups require overriding some configuration variables set in docker-compose.yml. The only way for that to work is to use a variable with no value, so it gets pulled from the environment.
It'd be nice to provide a default value for it, however. Something akin to SOMEVAR ||= defaultvalue.
