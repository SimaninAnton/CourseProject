I tried the docker-compose example shown here https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ on my Ubuntu laptop and all works well. I then tried the same thing from my Windows laptop (Docker Toolbox) with a HyperV created machine (docker-machine); I keep getting the same error

web_1 | python: can't open file 'app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
see that last line? The app.py is there in the rood directory.
