We have a v1 docker-compose.yml file, which we used so far with the x-networking flag:
web:
    build: images/web
    hostname: web
    container_name: project1_web

cli:
    build: images/cli
    hostname: web
    container_name: project1_cli
In the containers, we used so far the container name to refer to each other - the declared hostname not being added to each other's host file (see discussion issue #2925).
Now, some devs have updated their posts to docker-compose 1.6. The x-networking flag is gone, which is okish, but the problem is that the containers do not have any more a fixed hostname to refer to each other.
I might switch to a v2 compose file, but that will not do, as we have some developers on compose 1.5.
So far, the only workaround we found is to add everywhere 'links' tagss in the compose config, but that is not a perfect solution, as it only allows one-direction linking, whereas before we had circular references.
Am I missing something, or is this a bug ?
