Let me know if this isnt the way i should be doing this, but i have the following config:
version: '2'
services:
    webserver:
        image: abiosoft/caddy
        ports:
            - 80:80
        // ... Some other stuff
     api:
         // ... Normal stuff
     www:
         // ... Normal stuff
         extra_hosts:
             - "dev.api.example.com:webserver"
The webserver has multiple vhosts in it, and nothing defaulted, so i can't use webserver. I cant expose the port on the api container, as its not a webserver.
