Description of the issue
docker-compose run -d myservice
docker attach myservice
results in no colors in output
However,
docker-compose run myservice results in colorful output.
So, the -d somehow stops the colors from work, because colors work fine in foreground mode.
Also, if I try
docker-compose up           // <--- colors work here
then detach without stopping the containers
then reconnect with
docker-compose up         // <-- no colors
it will reconnect but with no colors
Context information (for bug reports)
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880fe
Output of docker version
Docker version 18.09.6, build 481bc77
Question
How do I get colors when "attaching" to existing docker-compose services started through run or up?
