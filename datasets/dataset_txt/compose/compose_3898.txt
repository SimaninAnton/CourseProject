I keep getting errors such as Invalid repository name (Docker_app), only [a-z0-9-_.] are allowed
Here's my fig.yml:
app:
  build: app/
  links:
    - redis
    - mysql
  volumes:
    - ./app/project:/var/www

nginx:
  build: nginx/
  ports:
    - 8080:80
  links:
    - fpm
  volumes_from:
    - app
  environment:
    <APP_SERVER_NAME>: dev-machine

fpm:
  build: fpm/
  links:
    - redis
  volumes_from:
    - app
  environment:
    APP_SERVER_NAME: dev-machine

mysql:
  image: mysql:latest
  ports:
    - 3363

redis:
  image: redis:latest
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
Cheers!
