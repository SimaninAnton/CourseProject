Hi,
I have come across a minor issue. The command option does not seem to use the latest environment variables, as specified in the config file.
If I have the following:
#.env
APP_PORT=123
#docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    environment:
      APP_PORT: 1234
    command: "program ${APP_PORT}"
The final command is program 123 not program 1234. This is preventing me from conveniently setting up different environments.
However, if I create a debug.env file and add all my environment variables in there, and load it using env_file: [debug.env], command will use the latest env vars as specified in debug.env.
P.S. I'm open to any suggestions of better ways to share environemnt variables.
