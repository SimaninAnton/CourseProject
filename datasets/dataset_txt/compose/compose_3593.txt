I am struggling with the proper use, when I include a data volume to a host directory mariadb fails. How do I use a host folder with docker-compose and with the correct permissions. In my docker-compose.yml I have:
expressionengine:
  image: mariadb
  expose: 
   - "3306"
  volumes:
   - ../containers/expressionengine/var-lib-mysql/:/var/lib/mysql
  environment:
   - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
   - MYSQL_DATABASE=expressionengine
But something is off:

Im sure its permissions given that the dir is written with my host user ownership:
bash-3.2$ cd containers/expressionengine/var-lib-mysql/
bash-3.2$ ls -l
