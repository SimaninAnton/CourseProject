$ docker-compose ps 
      Name                    Command               State             Ports          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
myapp_web_1        /bin/sh -c tail -f /dev/null     Up       0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp  
myapp_web_run_53   bundle exec rails s -b0.0. ...   Up       3000/tcp
[not working] Ports column has a different values, thus a page is not available on http://localhost:3000 when running $ docker-compose run web rails server -b '0.0.0.0'
[working] But if run docker-compose up with config line command: bundle exec rails server -b '0.0.0.0' in docker-compose.yml the page is available.
Probably if Ports will have the same values we will able to get page through running $ docker-compose run web rails server -b '0.0.0.0'
And localhost:3000 will be able to visit.
P.S.
my Docker & docker-compose.yml
I run on Ubuntu and do not have boot2docker
In first case I am able to visit page just through http://172.17.0.156:3000/
