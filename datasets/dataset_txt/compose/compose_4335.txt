After running my app and syncing the database all works fine, however after fig stop and then fig up the data is lost. This was working before the update. Any ideas?

  build: .
  volumes:
    - .:/code
  links:
   - db
   - redis
  ports:
   - 5000:5000
  command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000

db:
