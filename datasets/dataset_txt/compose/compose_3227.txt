I have the following docker-compose.yaml file:
data:
  container_name: project_dev_data
  image: busybox
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/mysql
    - ./storage:/var/www/storage

mysql:
  container_name: project_dev_mysql
  image: mariadb

  ports:
    - "3306:3306"

  volumes_from:
    - data

  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:
    MYSQL_DATABASE: project
    MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: "yes"

web:

  container_name: project_dev_web
  build: .

  volumes_from:
    - data

  links:
    - mysql:mysql

  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
    - "8080:8080"

  volumes:
    - .:/var/www
    - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh

  volumes_from:
    - data
During development, the container uses the bind mount .:/var/www to gain live access to my source. Unfortunately, this appears to be failing as my source contains a startup script and my entrypoint barfs when I try to start the container.
