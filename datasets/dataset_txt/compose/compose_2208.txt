I am gettig this error after I upgrading composer to latest beta because recently i faced this problem
AttributeError: 'ProjectError' object has no attribute 'msg' in 1.7.1 and found in here that , this issue has been solved and merged to master. Now in the same project i get the following error when i try to execure docker-compose via bash
ERROR: for test-db  Cannot start service test-db: Container command '/w/w' not found or does not exist.

ERROR: for test-token  Cannot start service test-token: Container command '/w/w' not found or does not exist.
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
Strange, however if I open terminal then cd to that directory and run docker-compose build then no error occurs
