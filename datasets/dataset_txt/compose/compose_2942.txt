Hi guys,
I have been using the -link option without any problems, until I got the time to carefully read the docs and realized that this a deprecated solution. So a decided to update one of my apps to the new networking system. My compose file contains 1 nginx and 2 webapp containers (alfa and beta that I use to deploy with minimum downtime using Ansible).
alfa:
  build: .
  net: "portifoliocesco"
  volumes:
    - ${PWD}/webapp:/srv/app
    - ${PWD}/supervisor/:/etc/supervisor/

beta:
  build: .
  net: "portifoliocesco"
  volumes:
    - ${PWD}/webapp:/srv/app
    - ${PWD}/supervisor/:/etc/supervisor/


nginx:
  image: nginx
  container_name: portifoliocesco_nginx
  net: "portifoliocesco"
  ports:
    - "9000:80"
  volumes:
    - ${PWD}/nginx/:/etc/nginx/
    - ${PWD}/webapp/app/static/:/var/www/static/
  environment:
    - VIRTUAL_HOST=www.cescoferraro.xyz
But when I run docker-compose up, NGINX thorows:
nginx_1 | 2016/01/06 22:53:48 [emerg] 1#1: host not found in upstream "portifoliocesco_alfa_1:9999" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:21
nginx_1 | nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream "portifoliocesco_alfa_1:9999" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:21
But if I run afterwards
docker run -it --rm --net=portifoliocesco busybox wget -qO- http://portifoliocesco_alfa_1:9999  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
....
</html>
and I can also up the NGINX container separately later too
docker-compose up nginx                          
Starting portifoliocesco_nginx
