I use docker-compose up -d to bring up my dev environment in a vagrant vm. At the end of the day I vagrant halt. The next day, I repeat the process. docker-compose begins pulling layers again. My understanding is it is only supposed to do a pull when the image isn't found locally or when I run docker-compose pull.
