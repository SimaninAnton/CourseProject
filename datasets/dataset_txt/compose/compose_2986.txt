Hi,
I encountered an issue when trying to run multiple images with docker-compose up. When I run the images separately, everything is fine. But if I try to run an image which links to another one and that one has a volume, it does not mount it.

docker-compose.yml of the application I run:
dev:
  build: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-dev
  container_name: frontend_toolbox_container
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - ./src:/var/www
  links:
    - rating
    - redis:db
  tty: true

rating:
  image: servicerating_dev

redis:
  image: redis
docker-compose.yml of service_rating:
dev:
  build: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-dev
  container_name: service_rating_container
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - ./src:/var/www
  tty: true
Result: 3 containers are running, the frontend_toolbox has a mount in /var/www, service_rating has no mounted files in /var/www.
I think this is a bug, but maybe I'm just doing something wrong?
