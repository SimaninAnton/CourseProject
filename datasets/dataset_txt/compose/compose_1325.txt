Hi Folks ,
I'm new with laradock and after installing i'm having an error after running this command
sudo docker-compose up -d mysql
and the error is
Service 'mysql' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone' returned a non-zero code: 1
What could the problem with the Time zone setting ?
I have checked everywhere and changed the TZ to my Time zone but still having the same issue
