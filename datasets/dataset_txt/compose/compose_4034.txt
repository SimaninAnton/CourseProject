I might be missing something obvious, but sometimes I want to be able to extract files from a container being run using docker cp.
But to do this I need to know the container ID or name. There is fig ps which gives this output:
$ fig ps
Name         Command       State    Ports
-------------------------------------------
api_api_1   ./run_tests.sh   Exit 0
There is also
$ fig ps -q
919df97040951615bc2c3f1e0835a1ab46dad764c84f20e4dd9ca6ba1abe60fe
The latter would be useful, but if there are multiple containers there is no way to differentiate between the ids.
The problem with the former is that that name api_api_1 will change container id when fig runs.
Is there a way to just get a mapping from service name to container id? I imagine one could extract this if the ordering of IDs in fig ps -q matches fig ps but I don't like having to rely on non-atomic operations where state could change in between calls, and there is no documentation to suggest the ordering is consistent.
