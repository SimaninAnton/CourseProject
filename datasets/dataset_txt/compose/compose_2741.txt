The difference between version 1 and version 2 is rather apparent for human readers, but a future version 3 might not be that easily recognised. Therefore the "version" key and its value should
be on the first line. The documentation now only specifies that it is in the root of the document.
The position can be checked with PyYAML by reading the first non-comment line of the file (assuming key and value are on the same line). With ruamel.yaml (PR 2959 you can use something like:
data = config.load_yaml(.....)
for k1 in data:
    version = data['version']  if k1 == 'version' else 1
    break  # only consider first data key-value pair
if version != data.get('version', 1):
    Warning('version specified but not on line 1')
If you use ruamel.yaml and with a bit of extra code
you can indicate where the version key was found instead of giving feedback that it is not there.
