fig.yml:
database:
    image: ...

tester:
    build: .
Commands:
fig run tester bash something.sh  # starts database and runs ok
fig ps # Shows database is still Up, nothing else

fig run tester bash something.sh # Still runs ok

fig stop # Now stop the database
fig ps  # Shows the database as exit 0

fig run tester bash something.sh # Starts tester, but NOT the database, links are missing from the container
fig ps # still shows database as exit 0
fig rm will clean out the state and it will start working again. I believe there is a check somewhere to see if the container exists, that maybe should be checking if the container is Up, not just if it exists.
I haven't looked into it much beyond this yet, but I wanted to write down the steps while I was hitting it.
