Hey. I'm having an issue when restarting Docker and consistently getting exceptions thrown. I'm using OS X Yosemite (v10.10.5). I've recently switched over to the stable version from the beta where I don't remember this happening.
The same kind of trace also seems to sporadically happen of its own accord but I can reliably reproduce the error by restarting using the OS X Menu icon.
Trace copied below:
