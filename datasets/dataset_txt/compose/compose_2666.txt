I have this in my Dockerfile:
...
CMD bash on-start.sh
I can run it using this and I get an interactive shell as desired.
$ docker run -it imagename
$ _
But it does not work when doing this:
$ docker-compose up
...
exited with code 0
If I do this, it works as well, but dependent services are not started.
$ docker-compose run myservice 
$ _
My versions:
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.10.0, build 590d5108
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
