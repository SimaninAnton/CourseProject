This breaks url builds. Eg. if you want to build from a github repo in docker compose on windows.
A fix would be to change the if check to check for urls:
if IS_WINDOWS_PLATFORM and not path.startswith(WINDOWS_LONGPATH_PREFIX) and not "://" in path:
     path = WINDOWS_LONGPATH_PREFIX + os.path.normpath(path)
A more sophisticated way of checking for urls would perhaps be needed.
