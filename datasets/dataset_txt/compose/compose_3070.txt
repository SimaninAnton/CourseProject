It would be very useful if there was a way to find out the container name (like, projectname_webserver_1) from inside of it, to use it as some kind of an id (like for kafka, or in the logs).
The only way to get it which I could find is by parsing it out from some *_NAME environment variable, which requires the container to have links, and feels bad.
