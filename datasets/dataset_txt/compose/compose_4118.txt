I'm starting to see this:
Invalid registry endpoint https://---REDACTED---/v1/: Get https://---REDACTED---/v1/_ping: EOF. If this
private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-
registry ---REDACTED---` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if you have access to
the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/
---REDACTED---/ca.crt
I'm sad to see the efforts of #573 and #490 stumble here.
