Depending wether I use docker-compose run with or without --rm, the exit status code is ignored.
Using docker-compose exec returns me a exit status code 129, while the same command with docker exec returns the correct status code.
I tried to understand what's happening under the hood, but I can't make sense of it, so I'll paste my results here.
 % $(docker exec qspot_php_1 php -r"exit(2);"); echo $?
2
 % $(docker-compose exec php php -r"exit(2);"); echo $?
129
 % $(docker-compose exec php sh -c "exit 2;"); echo $?
2
 % $(docker-compose run php php -r"exit(2);"); echo $? 
0
 % $(docker-compose run --rm php php -r"exit(2);"); echo $?
2
As you can see, there are quite a few differences :)
Is it a normal behavior?
What command should I use if I care about the exit status code?
PS: I'd like to be able to use the docker-compose exec version.
