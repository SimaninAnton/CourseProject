.env:
HOME_DIR=/home/user
DOCKER_DIR="${HOME_DIR}/docker"
PROJECTS_DIR="${DOCKER_DIR}/projects"
docker-compose.yml:
version: "2.2"

volumes:
    projects:
        external:
            name: "${PROJECTS_DIR}"
   webapp1:
        external:
            name: "${PROJECTS_DIR}/webapp1"
services:
    ...
    webapp2:
    ...
        volumes:
            - "${PROJECTS_DIR}/webapp2:/var/www/html/webapp"
    ...
I get the following:
ERROR: Named volume ""${DOCKER_DIR}/projects"/webapp2:/var/www/html/webapp:rw" is used in service "webapp2" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.
Is this a proper bevahiour? Shouldn't compose substitute the env within the env? Am I forced to use named volumes for each service?
