I have a repository with several projects inside. Sometimes there's some code sharing and I have to set up the context to be a common root. Troubles arise when there are several images that use the same context, but require different sets of files.
This takes away the simplicity of maintaining a small context and using a straightforward COPY to preserve structure. What would really help is if I could specify something akin to:
x-foo: &foo
  build:
     context: .
     dockerfile: ./foo/Dockerfile
     dockerignore: ./foo/.dockerignore
x-bar: &bar
  build:
     context: .
     dockerfile: ./bar/Dockerfile
     dockerignore: ./bar/.dockerignore
