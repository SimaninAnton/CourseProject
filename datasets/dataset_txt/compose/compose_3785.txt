Hi,
Is there a way to manually recreate containers (without running up)?
I find that I often run into the following situation:
$ docker-compose up
# Oh no there are errors in one of my containers, I want to rebuild it.
^C # shut down everything
$ # Change Dockerfile
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
I believe this is the recommended way of using compose, and I think it's a good interface for normal development, but I think that when I'm settings up my Dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml, I would much rather this sort of interface:
$ docker-compose start
# Oh no there are in my web container, I need to rebuild it.
$ docker-compose stop web # leaves the other non-dependent services running
$ # fix the web container Dockerfile
$ docker-compose build web
$ docker-compose start web
This doesn't work though, because the containers haven't been recreated. This has bitten me and my colleagues several times, but running docker-compose up just to have one of the containers recreated, is quite slow.
Thanks,
