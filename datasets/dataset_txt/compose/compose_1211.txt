Consider the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2.1'
services:
  labels_as_array:
    build:
      context: .
      labels:
        - "com.example.description=Description"
        - "com.example.department=Department"
        - "com.example.label-with-empty-value"
which is canonical sample from reference v2
The Dockerfile for the sample is irrelevalt and is simply FROM busybox
However, running docker-compose up, produces:
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.16.0-rc1, build 9bea70a
$ docker-compose up
Building labels_as_array
ERROR: json: cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type map[string]string
Note that the same sample is also listed for v3 here, but changing the version to '3.3' in the sample above does not help.
