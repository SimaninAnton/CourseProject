hello, i'm using fig in project with the following configuration :
web:
  build: images/node
  links:
    - db
  ports:
   - 3000:3000
  volumes:
   - www:/www
i've got Dockerfile files in images/image_name/ folders.
But running fig up web i've got the following error : Service 'web' failed to build: www: no such file or directory.
But when i move the Dockerfile to project root, adjusting the build parameter, it just works.
It makes me think that the context is where the Dockerfile is not where fig command is executed.
Is it the standard behaviour or not ? Issue #488 makes think it is not.
