Description of the issue
When using the gcloud credential helper on Docker for Windows, docker pull commands authenticate and succeed without problems. However, docker-compose pull or similar commands that trigger a pull will fail with file not found errors related to docker-credential-gcloud. This has been replicated across several systems.

Steps to reproduce the issue
Install Google Cloud SDK and authenticate
Run gcloud auth configure-docker to setup the helpers in config.json (per https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/configure-docker)
Run docker-compose pull using a docker-compose.yaml that pulls from a private GCR registry
Observed result
Pulling images from GCR fails with a low-level exception. However, docker pull commands work fine.
Expected result
Authentication using docker-credential-gcloud should succeed.

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update 1709 or Version Next 1803, running Docker for Windows 18.03 (no special installation steps)
We also tried downloading the latest docker-compose, 1.21.0, and overwriting the installed version. Same results.
