This is a distillation of #4181. When running docker-compose build if the underlying build command fails with an error, that error is not printed and instead the following completely unrelated error is:
$ docker-compose build web
Building web
ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
Is docker running?
$ docker info
Containers: 15
Running: 0
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 72
Server Version: 17.09.0-ce
It is.
Can we build the container using docker build?
$ docker build --no-cache -t api_web_1 ../../ -f web/Dockerfile
error checking context: 'no permission to read from '/home/ubuntu/koowalla-backend/deploy/letsencrypt/keys/0001_key-certbot.pem''.
A ha! We have a file permissions issue.
docker-compose should not display a misleading error message. It should (a) display no message at all, or more ideally (b) pass through the underlying error message from the docker build command.
If someone can give me a little guidance to where in the code this error originates I can take a crack at a PR for this.
