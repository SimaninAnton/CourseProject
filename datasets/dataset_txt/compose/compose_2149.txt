docker-compose.override.yml (used for development overrides)
version: '2'
services:
  base:
    environment:
      - EXTRA_DEBUG=1
      - CACHING=0
    volumes:
      - .:/app:ro
      - ./build:/app/build
The extra configuration for the "base" service in docker-compose.override.yml is applied to the phony "base" service itself, but not to services extending it.
