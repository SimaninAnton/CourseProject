In our projects, we need structure configuration format(eg json) more than flatten(env), but edit a compose file to include json string in environment is painful: quotes, comma, script indention...
Since yaml format can simply convert to json, why not just do it automated.
When use this compose file:
  apline:
    image: "alpine"
    entrypoint:
      - "/bin/sh"
      - "-c"
      - "export"
    environment:
        service_config:
          name: "name"
          node: "node"
docker-compose just gives me an error:
ERROR: Validation failed in file './apline.yaml', reason(s):
apline.environment.service_config contains {"node": "node", "name": "name"}, which is an invalid type, it should be a string, number, boolean, or a null
An environment item's value must be a string, number, boolean, or a null, so can we convert the value to json string when it is a map or array?
Is there any problem I didn't see? Anyone think this is useful?
If it's permitted, I'll make the changes and PR.
Thanks.
