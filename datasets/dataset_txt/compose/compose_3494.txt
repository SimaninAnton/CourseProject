As a user of compose (formally fig), I would like to be able to specify the number of nodes started for any given definition (a.k.a scale) from inside the manifest (yaml configuration file), so that I can ship my cluster definition with my service orchestration.
E.g. syntax:
worker:
    build: rqworker
    scale: 5
    links:
       - redis
    command: rqworker -u tcp://redis
