In the doc, there is very little explanation for the named volumes. It should be at least said that using one implies also having a top-level volumes key. Nevermind, running docker-compose build gives an explicit message about this.
So I added a top-level volumes key like this:
version: '2'
services:
    app:
        volumes:
            - db:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
    - db
But the docker-compose build failed miserably with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'
Instead, the expected syntax is (at least that's what's working for me):
version: '2'
services:
    app:
        volumes:
            - db:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
    db:
        driver: local
It would be nice to at least add an example in the docs. And maybe give a less cryptic error message.
Anyway, thanks for the great work, docker-compose is awesome!
