test.yml
web:
  image: bfirsh/compose-mongodb-demo
  environment:
    - "MONGO_HOST=counter_mongo_1"
    - "constraint:node==pc3"
  ports:
    - "80:5000"

mongo:
  image: mongo
$ DOCKER_HOST=pc0:2376 docker-compose -p counter -f test.yml --x-networking --x-network-driver overlay up 
Works fine first time. However, when I change contraint:node==pc3 to some other node, it fails:
$ DOCKER_HOST=pc0:2376 docker-compose -p counter -f test.yml --x-networking --x-network-driver overlay up
Recreating counter_web_1
ERROR: unable to find a node that satisfies container==36fddea9aa8601763b4c1e42ea8db924e4444c185e4d0b3bbd63e4e698fb300b
I need to delete the container on my own since I changed the host constraint, docker-compose rm does not delete the web container gracefully.
