for a service with more then one network, the networks are created in a strange way:
eth0 / eth1 order is ok, BUT
eth0 is eth0@ifxxx and eth1 is eth1@ifyyy where yyy < xxx, so f.e. "ip addr" command displays the network interfaces like:
eth1
eth0
which is strange, but I guess doesn't harm at all.
Unfortunately /etc/hosts contains "hostname" twice with the addresses of the host in net1 and net2 accordingly AND the order of these lines in /etc/hosts is not fixed, for some services the order is
hostname eth1-IP
hostname eth0-IP
and vice versa for some services. I think it should be deterministic.
