I haven't found a way to use fig to specify the hostname of a Docker container. I think this would be useful to have. Configuring could be something like this:
test:
  image: busybox
  hostname: mycomputer.somewhere.com
  run: hostname
Output would be something like this:
> fig up test
test_1 | mycomputer
fig_test_1 exited with code 0
