I'm seeing two test failures on master locally:
test_kill_interrupted_service (tests.integration.cli_test.CLITestCase)
test_kill_signal_sigint (tests.integration.cli_test.CLITestCase)
These were added recently #611 (9abdd33). For some reason they aren't failing in wercker.
I'm not sure how these tests pass. From what I can see the SIGINT should actually shutdown the container, but the tests expect the container to be running after a SIGINT.
Am I missing something?
