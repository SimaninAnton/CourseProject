I want to change the port of a service from. On 1.3.0 RC1
elasticsearch:
  image: elasticsearch:1.5.2
  ports:
    - 9200:9200
    - 9300:9300
into
elasticsearch:
  image: elasticsearch:1.5.2
  ports:
    - 9200:9200
I run docker-compose up and it did not update to the new configuration. After that, I tried to rebuilt by docker-compose build then docker-compose up, but it still the previous container. Any idea? Is it a bug?
