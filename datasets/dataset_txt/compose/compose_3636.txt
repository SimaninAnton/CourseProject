docker-compose 1.2.0
Docker version 1.6.2, build 7c8fca2
docker-compose.yml
service:
build: .
command: echo "Test"
Command: sudo docker-compose run --rm service
After that i did: sudo docker ps -a
And...
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
39c586829ab1 mega_service:latest "echo Test" 4 seconds ago Exited (0) 3 seconds ago mega_service_run_2
No log.info("Removing %s..." % container.name) was in the console. It fell into
dockerpty.start(project.client, container.id, interactive=not options['-T'])
and didn't reach next line.
