I noticed a problem with the output docker compose config.
If you put one or multiple files with a version: '3.1' spec in its output for the ports section looks like this:
 ports:
    - published: '443'
      target: '443'
    - published: '80'
      target: '80'
    - published: '8080'
      target: '8080'
The version stays on version: 3.1. As a result, the config fails to deploy as this is invalid in 3.1.
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.12.0, build b31ff33
