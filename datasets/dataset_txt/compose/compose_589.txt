Description of the issue
Running docker-compose with mounted volumes on Fedora/CentOS gives permission denied errors, because docker-compose doesn't set SELinux permissions unless explicit :z :Z flags are given from the command line.
Also moby/moby#30934 states that :z :Z are not default, because using it outside of project directory will relabel files and directories, breaking permissions if somebody mounts some home or system directory as container volume.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Run docker-compose on Fedora with SELinux
Observed result
Permission denied errors from apps inside container.
Proposal
For development docker-compose never leaves the scope of single directory with project sources. I believe that 80% of cases can be covered if docker-compose automatically labels files in project directory and gives warnings with no action for all mounts outside.
