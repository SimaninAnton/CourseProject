Consider that i have service with maven container
container_name: mvn
image: maven:3.3-jdk-8
#services will wait for mvn container to complete build
healthcheck:
  test: "exit 1"
  interval: 2s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 30
...
Now when I do 'up' or 'up -d', console hangs until maven container completes, and only then logs are attached
I can run 'docker-compose logs - f -t', but in new console instance. I wonder how can I avoid this ?
