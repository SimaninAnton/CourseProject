Hello guys,
I'm running tests in jenkins and I'm launching containers with docker-compose. So basically I'm running 8 tests at time (concurrently) and each one launches 6 containers. Sometimes tests pass with success other times it fails to start the containers.
So I managed to see using docker-compose logs that they are not starting because of this errors below:
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?
If it's at a non-standard location, specify the URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.
What could be causing this issue? Most of builds run all tests with success, but sometimes they fail because of one or two tests that have this error.
Thanks
