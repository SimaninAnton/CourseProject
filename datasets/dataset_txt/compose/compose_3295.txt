I have a Ruby on Rails application which I try to run it from docker with the help of docker-compose.
I can run docker-compose build and then docker-compose up which work fine.
In my settings of my app I configured the access to postgres with the env variables APP_DB_1_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR and APP_DB_1_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT
However my app is unable to connect to postgres. The error:
could not connect to server: No route to host
Is the server running on host "postgres" (172.17.0.32) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
From the host machine, I'm able to acces to postgres
Here my docker-compose.yml:
db:
  image: postgres:9.4.4
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
web:
  build: .
  command: bin/rails server --port 3000 --binding 0.0.0.0
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  links:
    - db:postgres
  volumes:
    - .:/myapp:z
Note: I'm running on Fedora 22
