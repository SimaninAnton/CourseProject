A feature I've thought would be useful since originally using Fig, and now Compose would be the ability to clear the log history for Composed-managed containers. Long-running or "chatty" containers can end up with a lot of log noise that may not be wanted.
I'd expect a command like the following would solve the problem:
$ docker-compose logs --clear [service]
