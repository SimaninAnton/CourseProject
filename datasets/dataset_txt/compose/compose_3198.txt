In my opinion it would be great to enable docker-compose to send some container information to an etcd store like forrest does (https://github.com/avgp/forrest).
This is a docker-compose.yml example file:
web:
build: ./webapp
etcd-hosts:
- 10.0.0.1
- 10.0.0.2
In this case when docker-compose creates and run new containers, they must register the container name, ip and ports in the etcd store at 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2.
When the containers are destroyed or stopped, docker-compose must erase their entry in the etcd store.
I this way, with the help of confd I can instruct my haproxy (by a manual configuration file reload) where the web containers are located within my swarm cluster and achieve a quite automated balancing process.
Maybe there are other useful situations where the etcd registrations come in handy.
I don't know if this is the right place to ask, maybe this feature should be built within docker itself.
What do you think?
