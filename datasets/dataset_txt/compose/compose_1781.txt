We're using CircleCI and after the latest release of docker-compose
After the command is run
sudo pip install docker-compose
Downloading/unpacking docker-compose
  Downloading docker_compose-1.10.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (81kB): 81kB downloaded
we get an error when running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml pull
ERROR: In file './docker-compose.ci.yml' service 'version' doesn't have any configuration options. All top level keys in your docker-compose.yml must map to a dictionary of configuration options.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml pull returned exit code 1

Action failed: docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml pull
docker-compose.yml is version 2.0 and it is working properly when using docker-compose 1.9.0
Running on Alpine 3.4
