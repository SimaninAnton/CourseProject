Hi folks, I've been thinking about allowing empty project names (-p '') to compose. I simply want to have containers named blog_1, cache_1, db_1; not dirname_blog_1, dirname_cache_1, dirname_db_1.
This can be done by allowing empty string value to --project/-p flag. If the flag is not specified at all, it can look at the dirname for the value; otherwise it would just omit it. It would look like this:
docker-compose -p "" up -d
WDYT?
