I am using docker-engine 1.7 in El6.
# docker version
Client version: 1.7.0
Client API version: 1.19
Go version (client): go1.4.2
Git commit (client): 0baf609

Installed docker-compose with
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
compose details:
# docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
docker-py version: 2.5.1
CPython version: 2.7.13
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016
docker-engine details
# rpm -qa |grep -i docker
docker-engine-1.7.0-1.el6.x86_64
Getting this error while using docker-compose:
# docker-compose up
ERROR: client and server don't have same version (client API version: 1.22, server API version: 1.19)
When I tried to use the workaround:
export COMPOSE_API_VERSION=1.19
Getting the error
# docker-compose up
/tmp/_MEIWqVCub/docker/api/client.py:161: UserWarning: The minimum API version supported is 1.21, but you are using version 1.19. It is recommended you either upgrade Docker Engine or use an older version of Docker SDK for Python.

No idea how to proceed further as this is the latest version available for el6.
