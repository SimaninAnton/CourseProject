Hi,
I try to run a PHP application in various containers with this docker compose configuration :
application:
    build: ./docker/application/
    volumes:
        - ./cityfid:/var/www/cityfid
        - ./logs/cityfid:/var/www/cityfid/var/log
    tty: true

mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
        - 27017:27017
    volumes:
        - /data/db:/data/db

engine:
    build: ./docker/engine/
    links:
        - application
        - mongo
    volumes_from:
        - application
    volumes:
        - ./logs/apache2/:/var/logs/apache2/
    expose:
        - 80
        - 443
When I run docker-compose up, all images are built correctly but after MongoDB started, the timeout error occurs. Here is the last output lines:
root@vps441711:~/cityfid# docker-compose up

If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
