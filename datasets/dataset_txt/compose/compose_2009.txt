version: '2'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    privileged: $PRIVILEGED
But I got this error output:
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.mongo.privileged contains an invalid type, it should be a boolean
Might be accept the value "true" will make sense..
Thanks
