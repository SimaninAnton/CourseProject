I have the following setup:
db:
  image: postgres:latest

app:
  ...
  links:
    - db
When I try to run docker-compose run app testcommand twice, it reuses the db container. Is it possible to make app create another db container?
What I'm after is:
app_run_1 ---> db_1
app_run_2 ---> db_2
I'm trying to isolate the services in order to run tests concurrently.
