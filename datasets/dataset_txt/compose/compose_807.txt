Multiple services can refer to a volume under the volumes section in the docker-compose file. When the volume does not exist the volume will be created by docker-compose, and data will be copied in from the container(s).
To make this process deterministic, how is it determined which container will be used to copy the data to the volume?
Do I need to use the depends_on key?
Can you add this information to the documentation?
