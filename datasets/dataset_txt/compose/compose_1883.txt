Currently when we pull a service, we get ~250 lines of output from all of those docker pulls, e.g. for one:
latest: Pulling from <image>

We have 20+ services, so this becomes an awful lot of output, even in the case where all of these are no-ops. It adds a considerable amount of noise to our logs, which can make debugging harder.
Would it be possible to add an option to be quiet on pulls (maybe only printing output when there is a failure)?
