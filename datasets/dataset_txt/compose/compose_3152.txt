Trying to run docker-compose up, my first container with a bind mount seems to be failing:
compose.cli.main.main: Cannot start container b097f0e6f952c1b40fd25f98f64ec27babe9efbfeabf224be939f07c87a9cd35: [8] System error: no such file or directory
Here's the relevant portion of my docker-compose.yaml:
search:

  container_name: dev_search
  image: elasticsearch

  volumes:
    - ./elasticsearch/docker-entrypoint.sh:/docker-entrypoint.sh
    - ./elasticsearch/config:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config
    - ./elasticsearch/data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
    - "9300:9300"
Docker Compose version:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version: 1.5.0rc3
Docker version:
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7
Docker Machine version:
$ docker-machine --version
C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker-machine.exe version 0.4.1 (e2c88d6)
Other fun facts:
Windows 10
Project runs fine on OSX and Linux
docker-machine ssh default and it looks like all the vboxsf mounts are good
Containers seem to be building fine, phewf!

Apologies if it seems like this is a duplicate, I haven't seen any momentum on getting this resolved and hopefully I'm not being dramatic when I say: This is quite a blocker and I'd love to be able to continue helping with testing my real project on Windows.
