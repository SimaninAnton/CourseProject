It would be awesome to have "optional: true" in fig.yml,
so container is not starting with when "fig up" / "fig up -d" is executed.
but only when you do "fig up " / "fig up -d "
It sould not affect current config so default is "optional: false"
Then you can have multiple versions / alternative solutions /
some specific containers for specific purposes, that are not starting by default.
