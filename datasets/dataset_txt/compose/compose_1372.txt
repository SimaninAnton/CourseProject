Summary
I am using the AWS ECR credential helper to manage logging in to my ECR Docker repositories. I have specified the ecr credential helper as a credHelper with my repo hostname. docker pull 12345.../my-app:latest for the image hosted there works, but docker-compose pull doesn't.
$ docker pull 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
latest: Pulling from my-app

Status: Image is up to date for 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
$ docker-compose pull
Pulling rethink-proxy (123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest)...
ERROR: repository 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest not found: does not exist or no pull access
Workaround
If I change credsStore from osxkeychain to ecr-login, then docker-compose pull works as expected. This is not a great option though, as it means I can't use the osxkeychain to store credentials for other repositories.

This looks similar to #4924, but I'm running the version that fixed that bug.
