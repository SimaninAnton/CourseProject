I was using docker-compose 1.11.1 and have now upgraded to 1.12.0.
My docker-compose file is version '2'.
The new version exits with an error:
ERROR: for elastic5  Cannot create container for service elastic5: invalid port specification: "127.0.0.1"
The port specification of elastic5 is:
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1::9200'
AFAICS, this should work fine (as it did before upgrading) since it uses the ip::containerPort format of the publish option to docker run.
