Using the following docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'
services:
    sandy:
        image: ubuntu:15.10
Executing docker-compose run sandy drops you into the container with the /bin/bash command (presumably).
However, trying to detach from the container with Ctrl-p Ctrl-q causes the following panic.

On a related note, running docker run -it --rm ubuntu:15.10 then trying to detach with Ctrl-p Ctrl-q consistently causes the terminal to lock up. A panic isn't even thrown. Detaching works fine without the --rm flag though.
I installed docker-compose via the Docker Toolbox for Mac OS X (version 1.10.1).
