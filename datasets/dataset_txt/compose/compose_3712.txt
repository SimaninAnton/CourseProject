If i have a docker-compose.yml file where i extend a service with another from a file for an example called config/development.yml.
It works fine after the first docker-compose up, if i then change a value, an enviroment variable in this case
common:
  environment:
    - DB_HOST=docker.dev:27017
to
common:
  environment:
    - DB_HOST=docker.dev:9000
and do a docker-compose restart backend, then DB_HOST will still be the old value before the edit, but if I do a docker-compose stop - docker-compose start, then DB_HOST is the correct value.
