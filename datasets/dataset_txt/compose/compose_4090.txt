I'm just starting with fig so it may just be a case of not reading properly the docs, but I haven't found out how to just build an image with fig. I'm trying to replace a make-based approach after someone told me a couple months ago that I was basically doing what fig does. I was also waiting for fig 1.0 to land in Fedora, which is almost there.
But I have a base image, which is basically based on centos:centos6, installs and enables EPEL, and a private YUM repository. I use this image as a base for all the containers, and incidentally benefit from caching and DRY.
Conceptually, it looks a bit like this:
find . -name Dockerfile
./base/Dockerfile
./db/Dockerfile
./front/Dockerfile
Now I can create and run db and front containers, and link them together, but I have built the base image separately. There is no base container.
Did I miss something?
