Right now extra_hosts and labels use "one of: object or array", but no validation is done on the contents of the object.
I think this can be improved by creating a schema for the object that uses patternProperties, so that it will fail if someone uses nested objects, or arrays within the object.
{
  "type": "object",
  "patternProperties": {"type": "string"},
}
