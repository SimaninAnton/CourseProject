I have a .env file that defines all my variables and when I run docker-compose scale thing=X the container is scaled, but it's not using the correct environment variables. It just reads the .env file and ignores any variables I have set in my shell.
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.11.1, build 7c5d5e4
So if I have a .env file that looks like this:
FOO=BAR
and then in my shell I set it to:
FOO=BAZ
and run the scale command - the containers receive FOO=BAR instead of FOO=BAZ.
