I have 2 docker containers, Jenkins master and Jenkins slave. I am using docker compose to start them
docker-compose up master worker
When the worker container stops either because the slave Jenkins crashed or because i manually stopped the container, the master also stops which is really unexpected with the following message( with --verbose flag) :
docker wait -> 137
eeadockerjenkins_worker_1 exited with code 137
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
docker containers <- (all=False)
docker containers -> (list with 2 items)
docker containers <- (all=False)
docker containers -> (list with 2 items)
Stopping eeadockerjenkins_master_1...
docker stop <- (u'013f5f6dec6a4d8d5c828fe05f762cff3802eb2c85827e6e7afb4d791905a78b')
docker wait <- (u'013f5f6dec6a4d8d5c828fe05f762cff3802eb2c85827e6e7afb4d791905a78b')
docker stop -> None
docker wait -> 143
If i start my container in detached mode using:
docker-compose up -d master worker
it's working fine, the master keeps running after the worker has stopped (or crashed). Any ideas why this is happening? Is this an expected behavior?
