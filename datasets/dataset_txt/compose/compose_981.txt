Hi,
I have a Jenkins project called "Hello-World" and it executes echo PWD && cd docker && docker-compose --verbose up -d shell command as part of "Build Step" but the build fails (see error below). However, when I SSH into Jenkins server and run the command myself, it works fine. I am not even sure if the error is related to Jenkins or Compose. Any solution to this?
Note: There is no such folder called /var/lib/jenkins/.docker though. Not sure if this is needed as the command runs fine manually.
Regards
