I've private docker registry hosted on a HTTP endpoint. While trying to pull image from the registry, it gives below errors -
docker.errors.DockerException: HTTPS endpoint unresponsive and insecure mode isn't enabled
Is there any way to specify insecure registry for docker-compose?
I've set --isecure-registry in docker conf and docker CLI works well with the registry URL.
