Assuming that
build:
    args:
        - key=token
is analogous to --build-arg <varname>=<value> command line option and it's realtion opt the ARG command in a Dockerfile, should the documentation not include the same warning about not using this to pass secrets as seen in the Dockerfile documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/arg

That the example uses password:secret seems particularly egregious if my assumption is correct.
If somebody can clarify my assumption in the affirmative I'll open a PR to update the examples and add the same wording as a warning from PR linked above.
