I've read through #942 but I think that thread primarily focuses on the automatic running of a container. I think there are more states, actually, and for my use case, being able to build an image without creating and/or running a container would be very useful.
I think what makes the most sense is to have 3 flags (defaulted to true):
build: true
create: true
start: true
or perhaps an array of options could open up the choices for later distinctions:
process:
  - build
  - create
  - start
as context, I want to be able to build an image along with all my other stuff, but the creation of containers is delegated to a user-driven process and thus docker-compose should not create the container for me
