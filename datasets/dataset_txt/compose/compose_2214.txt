Hi there.
I vaguely recall reading that this is possible somewhere, but I can't seem to find it now that I'm looking for it again.
The gist is: How do I prevent myself and others on my team from accidentally running docker-compose down? We use a cloud provider with Docker Machine and it's not uncommon for any of us to simply forget we're still connected to our production machine.
Thanks in advance.
