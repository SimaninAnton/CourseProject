I noticed the output from commands (set either in a Dockerfile, or in fig.yml) does not currentlf log out.
Here is a simple example that might demonstrate what I mean more clearly.
For a simple fig.yml file
echo:
    image: ubuntu
    command: echo hello
The result from running fig up is
Creating FigExperiment_echo_1...
Attaching to FigExperiment_echo_1
But I think it would be incredibly useful if the command from the container is also outputted, e.g.
Creating FigExperiment_echo_1...
Attaching to FigExperiment_echo_1
hello 
I noticed that docker-py's client start and create_container don't support the attach option currently, so I'm not to sure how involved a fix this might be.
