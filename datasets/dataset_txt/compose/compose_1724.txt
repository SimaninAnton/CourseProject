A few days ago requests 2.13 has been released. Unfortunately, docker-compose still enforces requests < 2.12:
'requests >= 2.6.1, != 2.11.0, < 2.12',
Is there a reason for this? Changes are mostly bugfixes.
It seems like some distributions already ship docker-compose with newer versions of requests without any issues.
