During debugging docker performance, I noticed that docker-compose add extra unnecessary load on docker while running docker-compose down.
Seems that instead of filtering the containers that are specified in the compose file, docker compose inspects each and every container on the host and only then performs the filtering.
In a scenarios where are many containers and many docker-compose instances are executing, it adds very high api load on docker daemon.
This is the code that does this flow: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/project.py#L702
when executed in the following flow: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/project.py#L324
Any specific reason for this implementation?
Thanks
