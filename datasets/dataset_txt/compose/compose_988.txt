According to the doc, the following parameters were added in v2.2. The corresponding PR appears to be #4835
However, I couldn't find any explanation whatsoever of what these parameters do. Doc says:
analogous to its docker run counterpart
But, docker run doesn't have these parameters. Neither does this.
So I'm looking at cpu_count: 2 and wondering how in the world is it different from cpus: 2. What does the word cpu_count mean to anyone who speaks English? Two counts of cpu. Well, that's exactly what cpus is supposed to be.
Can we stop this guessing game and clearly document the parameters?
