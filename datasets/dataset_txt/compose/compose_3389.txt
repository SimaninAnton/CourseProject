is it possible to support yaml merge keys in the compose file?
http://yaml.org/type/merge.html
this would allow to shorten files having similar values except for a few exceptions, e.g.
one: &base
  build: folder1
  volumes_from:
    - container
  restart: always

# same as one except for the base image
two:
  <<: *base
  build: folder2
with compose 1.4.0rc3 this throws a type error
