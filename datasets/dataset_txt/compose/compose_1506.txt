Hello.
Sorry for this issue (and for my english) but i don't understand how to manage users and permissions.
Example docker-compose.yml:
version: '3'
services:
  php:
    image: php:7.1.4-fpm-alpine
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
    user: www-data

 # ... and other services
If i run docker-compose up on my mac : inside the container, if i do a ls -la, the user and the group of the mounted files is www-data. php and me can read and write files.
If i run docker-compose up on my debian : inside the container, if i do a ls -la, the user and the group of the mounted files is 1000. php and me can't read and write files.
Can you explain me how can i have both php and me the permission to write files in the container on Debian ?
