I am running into an issue with docker-compose RC2 where it's referencing Docker images that don't exist.
it seems that it's trying to reference a name that doesn't exist, and is not in the usual compose_module_1 variety.
Seems to be referencing some-sha_compose_module_1 instead:
docker-compose up -d

No such image: 5370e5230ea776103dbd683e2fc4a51387860607e5f44024c5a10b2a8deb7094
Version check:

docker-compose version: 1.4.0rc2
docker-py version: 1.3.1
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1j 15 Oct 2014
This is reproducible, has happened multiple times when i blow all the containers/images away and try again.
