Hi,
my goal is to have a container that has two static IP addresses:
one static IP address assigned in the "backend" network defined in the compose file itself (easy to do with compose 1.7.0);
another static IP address, assigned in the same yml file but belonging to the same subnet of the host (and then belonging to a "network" not defined in the compose file).
in example (here below the solution for point 1):
services:
    forwarder_public:
        container_name: cforwarder_public
        hostname: Forwarder_public
        image: ubuntu
        tty: true
        privileged: true
        networks:
            1back:
                ipv4_address: 170.20.0.1
networks:
    1back:
        driver: bridge
        ipam:
          driver: default
          config:
          - subnet: 170.20.0.0/24
            gateway: 170.20.0.254
then now, in order to solve point 2, I'd like to assign a new IP interface of that service (ref. "forwarder_public") and assign a specific static and public IP address to it. That static and public IP address belongs to the same subnet of the host ip addresses (static in this case too).
Many Thanks in advance for your precious support.
