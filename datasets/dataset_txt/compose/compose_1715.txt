Nobody wants to run systemd in a container, but it's necessary because not all software is docker-ready, or docker is being used to simulate a production system.
It's great that docker 1.13 can now deploy a docker-compose.yml to swarm, but the limited configuration support means systemd containers will not run. docker stack deploy reports:
Ignoring unsupported options: cap_add, devices, privileged, security_opt, tmpfs
When will stack/bundle/dab/whatever support systemd containers, which require cap_add and tmpfs?
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    tmpfs: /run
    volumes:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro
    environment:
      - container=docker

PS: devices would also be very useful especially if the value could somehow be made different on different swarm nodes.
