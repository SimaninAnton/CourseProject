I've an issue with the latest rc2 release and the depends_on feature. My config looks like this:
docker-compose.yml
Getting error:
front.example.org | Message from VCC-compiler:
front.example.org | Backend host '"www.development.example.org"' could not be resolved to an IP address:
front.example.org | Name or service not known
So apparently the front.development.example.org container starts before it's able to resolve the host www.development.example.org to an IP address.
(I've attempted to manually sleep for two secs before starting front main application, and then it works fine.)
