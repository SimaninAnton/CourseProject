I am unsure if I am missing this in the docs or not, but I'm not seeing any way in Compose 1.6.0 that implements the new --net-alias support in Docker-Engine.
Here's the relevant add from the Docker Engine release notes: moby/moby#19242

    example

services:
    www:
        image: apache:2.4.18
        networks:
            example:
                aliases:
                    - localweb
                    - www.localaddress.com
