Hello,
Thanks for your hard work on this.
Just as an FYI, in Arch distros /usr/bin/env python is python 3. This is causing some build issues (which, I assume is related to compose's partial python 3 support).
Is there any possibility of changing the shebang line in the binary to explicitly call #!/usr/bin/env python2?
