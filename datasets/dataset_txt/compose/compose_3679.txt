I have the following docker-compose.yml:
nginx:
  build: .
  ports:
   - "80:80"
.. along with this Dockerfile in the same directory:
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y nginx

CMD nginx && tail -f /dev/null
Now if I do "docker-compose up", I get the following image entry:
jonas@cyberman#11: docker images
REPOSITORY                         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE

"nginx_nginx"? Really? You couldn't just use "nginx" as I named it?
If you really want to have such weird naming schemes, at least let me override it with a proper name.
