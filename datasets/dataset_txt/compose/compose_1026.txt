According to the Docker-Compose documentation listed here, using pre-existing networks is super simple:
networks:
default:
external:
name: my-pre-existing-network
^ think of this in YAML formatting
But in my version (1.16.1 on Fedora 27), this syntax does not work. I get this error:services.my_container.networks.default contains unsupported option: 'external' Either the documentation is incorrect/misleading, or the version of Docker-Compose I am running is broken.
