Description of the issue
So many times I must run docker-compose from a specific place.
.env file
docker-compose.yml(and relative path start point for -f),
-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-2.yml
default value of -p
etc.
But I wish run it from any location. Ordinary -f is solution, but in this case I cant use .env file.
How about option, who change workdir before run command and restore it after.
BASEDIR=$(pwd)
targetdir = parse options to find -w or --workdir
cd targetdir
command = original command w/o option -w 
exec command 
cd BASEDIR
if someone already use this way - please show me a bash alias / script
