I'm currently trying to use the new "multiple files" (#2051) feature and got stuck on extends not working anymore when used together.
Example:
# common.yml
baseservice:
  labels:
    - "my.label=my-value"
  environment:
    MY_ENV: "MY_VALUE"

# base.yml
service1:
  extends:
    file: common.yml
    service: baseservice
...more stuff...

# dev.yml
service2:
  extends:
    file: common.yml
    service: baseservice
...more stuff...
When started with:
docker-compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml up
the services do not include the labels and env vars from "baseservice".
Just for testing purposes, I tried to use a random name for the extends/file field in dev.yml and it did not complain about not found files, which looks like it doesn't even try to open the file.
