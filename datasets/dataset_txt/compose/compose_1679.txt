I am new to docker and not have much experience with windows commands too.
I tried to access the directory of my new created VM(worker) but it gives me permission error.
C:\Windows\system32>docker-machine ssh worker /home/docker
sh: /home/docker: Permission denied
Could anyone please suggest why I am getting this error ?
Docker installed details:
Version 1.13.1 (10072)
Channel: Stable

Windows 10 Pro
