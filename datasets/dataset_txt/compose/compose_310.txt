Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
docker-compose build does not output the first line of docker build output, which is "Sending build context to Docker daemon ... kB". This part sometimes takes too much time since .dockerignore is not well-configured.
In the case of me, I could not know why docker-compose build took so much time (in fact, there were huge files in the context directory) until I tried to docker build manually.
Describe the solution you'd like
Output "Sending build context to Docker daemon" would help to diagnose the problem of .dockerignore.
Thank you.
