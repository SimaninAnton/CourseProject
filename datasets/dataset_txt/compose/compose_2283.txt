Hello,
I'm trying to use external_links to link to a container outside of the compose network. However it does not work. One solution is to add network_mode: "bridge" to all services.
Is there a way to except that external_links automatically links to the bridge network?
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    depends_on: [mongo]
    external_links: ["grafana_graphite_statsd:statsd"]
  mongo:
    image: mongo
