Hello, guys, I'm kind of new to this.
I've created a Docker File
FROM node:7
# Working directory for application
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Binds to port 7777
EXPOSE 7777
# Creates a mount point
VOLUME [ "/usr/src/app" ]
and this is my docker-compose.yml file
version: "2"
services:
  redis:
    image: "redis"
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:9.4"  
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
     - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
     - .:/usr/src/app
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    command: ["npm", "start"]
Now I ran docker-compose up -d and I'm not getting any error. But the problem is when I try to access it using this url 0.0.0.0:4000 it throws me this error "this site can't be reached"
Can you guys help me out thanks
