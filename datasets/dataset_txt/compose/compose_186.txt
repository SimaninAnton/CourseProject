Hi Team:
I am using bitbucket+docker-compose+shell script to deploy services.
my work way is docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d.
what I expect :
the above process is exited once some errors(abnormal) show s.
what it is actually:
I have some bad configuration to cause image built with error.I can see the errors explicit there.but the build show itself successful and continue to docker-compose up -d.
I hope it exited as actually errors are present.as it is a part of my deploying service on prod environment.I hope everything goes well and exit once any errors are born.
please help me.thanks.
