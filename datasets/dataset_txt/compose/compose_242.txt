I want to keep launching the server using docker-compose.
but I want to use command | entrypoint when I launched the server.
I wrote docker-compose.yml as follows.
version: '3'
services:
  db: ##pass##

  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    command: echo "entry!!"  # this is dummy command
    depends_on:
      - db
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
However, the server stopped if it was up.
Please help me.
Can anyone teach me about how to solve this problem?
