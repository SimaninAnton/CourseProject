I create a lot of compose file that I hope are useful for the community.
I'd like to find a way for docker to officially ship these compose files.
There is one issue that IMHO is blocking us of doing so, is the ability to ship a file in docker-compose.
Indeed, what distinguish a piwik from an ownCloud from a WordPress compose file is only the nginx configuration.
There are 3 way that I know to ship this configuration:
The first option: a file on the host:
  volumes:
    - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
The second option: the current inline way:
web:
  image: nginx
  volumes:
    - ./data:/var/www/html
  command: |
    bash -c 'bash -s <<EOF
      cat > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf <<EON
        daemon off;
        user www-data;
        events {
          worker_connections 768;
        }
        http {
          gzip on;
          gzip_disable "msie6";
          include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
          server {
            listen 80;
            root /var/www/html;
            index index.html;
          }
        }
    EON
    nginx
    EOF'
A bit dirty
The 3rd way: inline file
web:
  image: nginx
  volumes:
    - ./data:/var/www/html
  files:
    -   owner: root:root
        path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        permissions: '0644'
        content: |
         user www-data;
          events {
            worker_connections 768;
          }
          http {
            gzip on;
            gzip_disable "msie6";
            include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
            server {
              listen 80;
              root /var/www/html;
              index index.html;
            }
          }
And so, I'm sure you see the value to have a proper way to add inline file.
The syntax could be similar to what cloudinit does.
With this, it would become easier to ship one compose file with everything included to get started an app!
