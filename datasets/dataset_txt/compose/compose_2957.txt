Hi,
I have a use-case where I'm starting to develop a docker-compose.yml configuration of 20+ services. I'd like to start grouping similar services together so that I can run docker-compose up on a select group, instead of listing the individual services. What are your thoughts about supporting a groups attribute that supports an array of tags, like:
myservice:
  container_name: myservice
  build: services/myservice
  groups:
    - core
    - web

mydatabase:
  container_name: mydatabase
  build: services/mydatabase
  groups:
    - core
    - web

something_else:
  container_name: somethingelse
  build: services/something_else
  groups:
    - misc
To start myservice and mydatabase, I could run docker-compose up --groups=core, docker-compose up --groups=core,web, etc.
Thanks!
