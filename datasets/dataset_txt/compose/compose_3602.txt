I have a system that execs the composecommand and that logs the output (stderr/stdout output streams redirected) to a log file.
Apparently the docker up -d is showing some image pull animations (obviously contains ANSI escape sequences to clear lines or delete chars) and when those get logged to the log file, I just see bunch of empty lines.
Not a big deal, mostly a cosmetics issue but wanted to bring up if it's easy to fix.
