The following command fails, trying to pull image from the Docker Hub:
$ docker-compose up -d
Pulling web-server (web-server:staging)...
ERROR: repository web-server not found: does not exist or no pull access
But I just want to use a local version of the image, which exists:
$ docker images
REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
web-server           staging             b94573990687        7 hours ago         365MB
Why Docker doesn't search among locally stored images?
