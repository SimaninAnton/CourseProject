Hi.
I'm not sure whether this is a bug in the software, or a mistake in the online documentation. Looking at the online docs, I saw that docker-compose rm should have an option -s (or --stop) to auto-stop the containers, if necessary, before attempting to remove them. This seemed like a handy shortcut, so I gave it a go and received the following output, which seems to suggest that option is not available:
Removes stopped service containers.
By default, anonymous volumes attached to containers will not be removed. You
can override this with -v. To list all volumes, use docker volume ls.
Any data which is not in a volume will be lost.
Usage: rm [options] [SERVICE...]
Options:
-f, --force Don't ask to confirm removal
-v Remove any anonymous volumes attached to containers
-a, --all Deprecated - no effect.
I'm using the latest version of Docker for Mac (17.03.1-ce-mac5, which has Compose 1.11.2).
