There are various informations about in which docker-engine version is which docker-compose file version available:
Release page says 3.3-3.5 are for 17.06+
Compose-matrix (include file for doc page) doesn't even mention 3.5
https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/3c44bc7f746d161efb4399a56db809c352ab5521/_includes/content/compose-matrix.md
And this (I guess correct) document shows that 3.4 and 3.5 needs version 17.09 and 17.12 respectively.
