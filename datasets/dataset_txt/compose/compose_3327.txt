According to the spec, "volumes_from" should accept the name of a service or container, but it can't find the container if the name is custom container name.
Example of docker-compose.yml here;
dev:
  image: busybox
  container_name: data
  volumes:
    - ./db/mongodb:/data/mongodb
mongo:
  image: mongodb
  volumes_from:
   - data
If I type docker-compose ps then an error raises as follows:
Service "mongo" mounts volumes from "data", which is not the name of a service or container. 
May be the timing of name resolution is too early.
