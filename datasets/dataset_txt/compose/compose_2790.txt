When I try to run docker-compose build for my api project, everytime without fail I get
Step 6 : COPY dist/api.js dist/api.js
ERROR: Service 'api' failed to build: lstat dist/api.js: no such file or directory
The file definitely exists. I've tried renaming it, moving it, almost everything and cannot get it to work. Everything works fine under OSX.
Any ideas?
EDIT: here is the relevant part of my dockerfile
WORKDIR /src
COPY package.json package.json
RUN npm install

COPY dist/api.js dist/api.js

Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "run", "api"]
