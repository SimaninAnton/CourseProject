Hi, thanks for very useful tool. How can I deploy updates to my rails app on production with zero downtime.
Currently I run the following on production, but it causes about 10 seconds of downtime.
sudo fig pull web
sudo fig up -d web
My production fig.yml:
db:
  image: postgres:9.3
  volumes_from:
    - db-data
  ports:
    - 5432
web:
  image: myaccount/my_private_repo
  command: bundle exec unicorn -p 3000 -c ./config/unicorn.rb
  volumes_from:
    - gems-2.1
  ports:
    - "80:3000"
  links:
    - db
Thanks
