Description of the issue
To run my project's integration tests I need to run go get -t ./... in container first, which in turn needs access to private repos, which means I should copy my ~/.ssh into container. I can't use bind-mount because CI use remote docker, so I have to docker cp it. This means I should:
create containers first,
then copy SSH keys,
then start containers.
The problem is:
To make docker-compose correctly exit after tests will finish I should use up --exit-code-from.
To avoid starting containers before I'll copy SSH keys I should use either up --no-start or create.
up --no-start complains it's not compatible with --abort-on-container-exit (implied by --exit-code-from)
I don't see any reasons why these options have to be incompatible, so probably this should be fixed
create complains it's deprecated and doesn't set environment variables I need.
