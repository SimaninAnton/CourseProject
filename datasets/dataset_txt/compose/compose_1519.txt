Hi,
small feature suggestion:
It would be nice if the configuration (docker-compose.yaml) could be created dynamically on the fly.
Currently I've got a script that dumps the file to the file system, and docker-compose loads it.
I'd like it if docker-compose could run my script directly to get the configuration.
Two ways to do it:
when docker-compose.yaml file is executable, it's executed and the output loaded with yaml.load.
add a new .env / CLI environment variable for the purpose.
Cheers
