Example docker-compose.yml with short-form port mapping:
version: '3.2'
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
Result of docker-compose config:
$ docker-compose config
networks: {}
secrets: {}
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins
    ports:
    - published: '8080'
      target: '8080'
version: '3.2'
volumes: {}
When using the resulting configuration, an error occurs:
$ docker-compose config | docker-compose -f - up
ERROR: The Compose file is invalid because:
services.jenkins.ports.published contains "8080", which is an invalid type, it should be an integer
