Version 1.4.0.
The docker-compose 'run' command wrongly uses old ports for linked containers when the yaml configuration file has changed between runs.
How to reproduce:
Define a yaml with a service (i.e. web) and a linked service (i.e. db) and expose db port on host.
Start the web service using 'run' (so that the linked db instance is created because it runs for the first time). It does not matter if you use the 'service-ports' option, because this only affects the service you are actually starting, not linked services.
Stop the web service if it's still active. (Hit Ctrl-C or use docker-compose command if you ran it in bg).
Kill the db service.
Change the db port mapping in the yaml. (So it uses another host port).
Now, when you start the web service again using 'run', it does not use the new port but still the old port configuration.
It think this is a bug, because docker-compose 'up' command actually does use the new ports defined in the yaml.
Should the 'run' command not do the same?
