It is a common pattern to define a base Compose file, and then define Compose files for different environments with a few small changes.
It is currently possible to extend single services, but it is very verbose to include a large number of services and make a small change to one of them (for example, setting RAILS_ENV=production).
It should be possible to extend a Compose file with a complete set of services from another Compose file. All of those services will be copied into the Compose file, as if you were extending each of the services individually:
If you don't define a service in the child file, it is copied as-is.
If you do define a service, it should behave as if you've extended that single service.
There is no way of undefining a service (yet)
This is an intentionally simple first step, and I am intentionally not defining a syntax so we can discuss.
Design questions:
This is the first top-level configuration we have added to Compose. How should we do this?
