Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'm always frustrated when I have to run a bunch of docker-compose commands manually because it's long to type (i would prefer dockerctl but that's another story):
pull
build
down
up -d
logs
ps
Especially when automating docker-compose deployments from CI, calling logs and ps in the job do save the systematic action i would take on the server that is running these commands before debugging any kind of problem -> automating them saves from typing them later.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like docker-compose apply to run the deploy chain of automation and post deployment logs commands.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Currently, I have implemented this in my docker-compose wrapper I use for experimental commands (other notable ones are backup and restore, planned for submission one day).
Additional context
I'm submitting the apply command idea here, because I'm so happy with it i want to share it with the community ;)
