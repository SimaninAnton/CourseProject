Hi there,
I'm trying to use the devicemapper storage backend for volumes. Here is my example docker-compose file:
version: '2'

services:
  influxdb:
    image: influxdb:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/lib/influxdb

volumes:
  data:
    driver: devicemapper
I get the following error:
# docker-compose up -d
Creating volume "test_data" with devicemapper driver
ERROR: Volume data specifies nonexistent driver devicemapper
I've configured docker to use the devicemapper storage driver:
# docker info | grep Driver
WARNING: No swap limit support
Storage Driver: devicemapper
Logging Driver: json-file
Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs
If I remove the driver: devicemapper statement, everything works, however the volume is created at /var/lib/docker/volumes/... as a plain folder volume.
For me this is an issue, as the / partition is quite small, while the disk I'm using for the devicemapper storage is a lot bigger.
Is this expected? Is there a way to have the named volumes also on the devicemapper backend?
For reference:
