IOError: [Errno 0] Error
Failed to execute script docker-compose
docker-compose.yml:

  ignite:

This error only happens on one of my 3 machines, so I have no idea what causes it. Resetting to factory defaults or reinstalling docker doesn't help. Without docker compose the image is pulling and then working fine. All the machines are on windows 10 and latest stable docker installed.
