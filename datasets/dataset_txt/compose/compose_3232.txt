Possibly this is already done but I can't find anything about it. I tried running...
pip install https://github.com/docker/compose/archive/master.zip
But i get an odd error saying ImportError: No module named queue.
Anyway since this project on a weekly basis is merging in PRs that make my life significantly easier such as the recent addition of allowing multiple files with the -f flag I feel like it would be worthwhile to have a nightly available.
