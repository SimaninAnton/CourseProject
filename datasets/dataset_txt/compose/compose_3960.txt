Allow users to encrypt environmental variables in their yaml configuration so they can still feel comfortable keeping them in version control. Would decrypt values transparently with a chosen environmental variable (like FIG_CRYPT_KEY) and provide users a helper command to generate encrypted values.
Only downside is you have to add pycrypto as a dependency.
