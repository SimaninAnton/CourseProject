This is an idea to have options to run a command on fig up / fig stop so script have a chance to do some prep.
e.g.:
pre-command: cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa .
post-command: do some cleanup, send email notification, etc.

web:
  build: .
  command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
  volumes:
What do you think?
Update:
The pre-command and post-command will be run on host machine, not container.
