Hello,
After looking for hours about the error I still can't find any solution.
I expected to can mount a CIFS volume from a network folder with special characters.
But, I couldn't.
The stack trace is the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "docker-compose", line 6, in <module>
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 71, in main
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 121, in perform_command
  File "compose\cli\command.py", line 40, in project_from_options
  File "compose\cli\command.py", line 110, in get_project
  File "compose\config\config.py", line 383, in load

  File "compose\utils.py", line 130, in <genexpr>
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 55-56: ordinal not in range(128)
Failed to execute script docker-compose
and the volume is something like:
volumes:
  shared:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      device: //192.168.1.222/Something/Folder_Instruções
      o: username=${USERNAME},password=${PASSWORD},file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,iocharset=utf8
Version
docker-compose version 1.19.0, build 9e633ef
I am running on windows host.
Hope someone can help.
EDIT:
I also tried with version 1.18.0, but the problem persists
