the postgresql database doesn't seem to start, nothing can connect:
fig run web rake db:create
could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
Also tried:
fig run db /usr/bin/psql -l
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
Is the server running locally and accepting
connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
and
fig run db /usr/bin/psql -h 127.0.0.1
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host "127.0.0.1" and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
