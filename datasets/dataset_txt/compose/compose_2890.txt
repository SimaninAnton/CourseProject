I am using compose variable interpolation because I would like to make part of the compose template configurable.
This works for some parameters, however, there seems to be an issue with parameters that expect an integer value (tested against 1.5.2 and 1.6 dev).
Typically, if I want to change the cpu-shares parameter I end up with an error :
ERROR: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type int64
Looking at what happens in interpolation.py and checking the content of the interpolation result:
when the cpu-shares is "hard coded" the resulting dict is
{ ... 'cpu_shares': 1024 ... }
when the cpu-shares is set to use a variable using cpu_shares: ${CPU_SHARES} the resulting dict is
{ ... 'cpu_shares': '1024' ... }
This looks to me like the root cause of the problem.
I am not sure what the best approach would be:
should I try to add a tentative cast after the Template(string).substitute ?
should I add some post processing in config.py or in validate_against_fields_schema ?
