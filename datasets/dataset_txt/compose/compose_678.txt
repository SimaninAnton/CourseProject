For our app we try to restart the nginx-gen with docker-compose so it can reload a .envfile into the container. We can easily do that in the host with
#docker-compose up -d nginx-gen
nginx-gen is up-to-date
When I share docker.sock I can docker-compose ps with no problem
BUT I cannot reload nginx-gen FROM inside my other container where my code is.
root@796fbb6c59ce:/mnt/Docker# docker-compose up -d nginx-gen
Creating nginx-gen ... error

How can I reload the config of nginx-gen from my other container!?
Thank you for your time :)
