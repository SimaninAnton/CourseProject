I think #4994 needs to be reopened.
Not having feature parity for sensible data does basically break prod-dev parity paradigm.
The only work around I can think about is accepting world-read permissions in dev and do a hacky entry script for file copying and permissions modifications.
It is clear that it always can only be a mock implementation, but it should be a genuine one, then.
Some examples, which do indeed check and complain about file permissions:
ssh
pgpass
