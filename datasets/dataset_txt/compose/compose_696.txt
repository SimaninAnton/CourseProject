In 1.21.0, we introduced a change to how project names are sanitized for
internal use in resource names. This caused issues when manipulating an
existing, deployed application whose name had changed as a result.
This release properly detects resources using "legacy" naming conventions.
How does exactly compose detect resources using legacy naming conventions?
