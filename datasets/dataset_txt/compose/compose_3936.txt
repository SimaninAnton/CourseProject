I propose that Compose be able to support a way to create volume containers that never run. Right now, if you want to describe a volume container in your figfile, you must expect it to run. The best you can do is
data:
    image: tianon/true
    volumes:
        - /my/volume
service:
    image: whatever
    volumes_from:
        - data
But it shouldn't be necessary to run a DVC at all. In the commandline Docker client I can do:
c=$(docker create --entrypoint=_ -v /my/volume scratch)
docker run --rm --volumes-from="$c" busybox dd if=/dev/urandom of=/my/volume/foo bs=1M count=1
docker run --rm --volumes-from="$c" busybox du -hs /my/volume/foo
docker rm -v "$c"
It's admittedly a little strange to have to provide an entrypoint to scratch, but it doesn't ever run, so it doesn't make a difference. It would be nice to be able to do this in Compose as well.
data:
    image: scratch
    create_only: true
    volume: â€¦

#697 asks to be able to run a subset of containers. This is similar in that it asks not to run a container. Perhaps this provides a use case for that, but that issue still implies that the containers can be run. This proposal is to mark containers for creation, but never to run them.
#613 - Despite the similar title this is a feature request with significantly different implications.
