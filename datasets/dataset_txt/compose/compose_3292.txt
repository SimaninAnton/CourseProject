First of all, I want to apologize because I don't know if this is a bug or a misconfiguration on my side, but I tried to look for this problem but I don't have any response back.
I'm trying to use the docker-compose in Windows. I'm trying the pull request #1957 and I'm getting this error when I try to run an up command:
jsonschema.exceptions.RefResolutionError: <urlopen error [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified: u'\fields_schema.json'>
This is the full stacktrace I'm getting:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Thanks in advance and sorry if this is not a real bug :(
