I think it would be a lot more convenient if the file parameter in the extends block would default to the current file instead of throwing KeyError. Example:
base:
  image: nginx
web:
  extends:
    service: base
I would also suggest defaulting the service parameter to same as that its defined in if file is not missing. Example:
production.yml:
web:
  image: nginx
docker-compose.yml:
web:
  extends:
    file: production.yml
I do realize that the latter may be a little counter-intuitive, but I think the first part could be done.
