Issue
So I have a dockerfile below
FROM cc-tokenizer-client as signup-component
LABEL anex="true"
ARG CONFIGURATION="Release"
WORKDIR /solution/ANEX.Website.Osu/signup-component/
COPY ./ANEX.Website.Osu/signup-component/. ./
COPY --from=common /solution/ANEX.Website.Common/dist-esm/. /solution/ANEX.Website.Common/dist-esm
RUN sed -i -e 's~yarn --cwd ../../ANEX.CcTokenizer.Client build-esm &&~~g' ./package.json
RUN sed -i -e 's~yarn --cwd ../../ANEX.Website.Common build-esm &&~~g' ./package.json
RUN yarn build-esm
cc-tokenizer-client and common are in there own dockerfiles I have a multi from pattern here.
When I try build everything the result i get is below...
Observed result
#61 0.842 $   tsc -p ./src/tsconfig.esm.json
#61 9.344 src/common/Utils.tsx(1,22): error TS2307: Cannot find module '@anex/common'.
The result above is the inverse where it explains about @anex/cc-tokenizer-client if I invert the FROMs and do FROM common and COPY --from=cc-tokenizer-client
So it feels like COPY doesn't work on images in other dockerfiles. The strange thing though is when i log the solution folder the stuff is there and files actually have content.
Expected result
Expect it to work. Really strange that switching the FROMs causes the inverse issue. Maybe with COPY instructions you need to import the dockerfile? If that is possible? Kind of new to Docker.

So if this question is more appropriate for moby/moby let me know and will ask over there instead.
