As a developer of python microservices I often find myself implementing pytest fixtures that yield container objects a la https://github.com/docker/docker-py . Often times what I would really prefer to do is access information about services/containers from within tests to provide access to my service running as a container that has access to other containers in the same network.
The pytest-docker library does this to some extent but it's current implementation and distance from docker-compose makes me think that it may not provide a stable long term interface for doing this. In avast/pytest-docker#20 I have suggested to that author to consider porting his code to this repository, where I think there is a better opportunity to avoid breaking changes as new versions of docker-compose are released in the future by writing tests that run here to ensure such such api changes necessitate changes in the docker pytest fixtures.
