Description
It seems mounting a host directory as a data volume with relative path to current host dir using docker-compose no longer works in Windows.
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    build:
      context: ./
    volumes:
      - .:/test
I've tested it with Windows 10, Docker version 1.12.1, docker-compose version 1.8.0, which didn't work. And on Ubuntu 14, Docker version 1.12.0, docker-compose version 1.9.0dev, which works as usual.
Steps to reproduce:
Clone https://github.com/laggingreflex/docker-test
Run it on windows, and for comparison run it on Linux
Expected result:
The current dir which is mounted should be ls-ed and its contents output.
CMD ls /test
Actual result:
On windows it outputs nothing (ls of an empty dir, means it didn't actually mount). Works on Linux, shows the two files of the test project.
Absolute paths still work as usual, like
   volumes:
      - /c:/test
