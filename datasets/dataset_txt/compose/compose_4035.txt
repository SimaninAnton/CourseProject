It seems that fig pulls all image tags. Whereas docker uses an explicit command line flag "-a". The default is to download just the latest tag.
E.g. with this fig.yml:
web:
  image: busybox
  command: /bin/echo hello 
a fig pull downloads 5 images. docker pull busybox just downloads one (the :latest) image.
Is this on purpose? What is the reasoning for this?
