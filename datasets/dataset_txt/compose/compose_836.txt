I have the docker-compose file with two containers:
version: "2"
services:
  dev:
    build: .
    links: db
  
  db:
    image: mysql
I'd like to scale these dev and db containers in a way so each dev container will be in the network with only one db container, i.e.:
I'd like to have:
N networks "network_1", ..., "network_N"
N dev containers: "dev_1", ..., "dev_N" ("dev_x" belongs to network "network_x")
N db containers: "db_1", ..., "db_N" ("db_x" belongs to network "network_x")
The problems are:
"--scale dev=N --scale db=N" option makes every dev container link to db_1 container as "db"
Not sure how to specify such network relationships in docker-compose
I have only one host machine so I think I don't need Docker Swarm or Docker Stack but if they support such use case it may be fine to use them.
