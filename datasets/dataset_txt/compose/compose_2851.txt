Not sure if this is supported, but I'm trying to do is use an overlay network endpoint reference in my application file (where "lstest" is the overlay name) to support a multi-host swarm setup:
ls:
  build: .
  ports:
    - "12201:12201/udp"
logtester:
  build: ./test
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-logdriver
  log_driver: "gelf"
  log_opt:
    gelf-address: "udp://lstest_ls_1:12201"
The error I get when running compose up (with overlay option and -p lstest):
ERROR: Cannot start container c9e93566d0ac83365e91235fa74c6aeab51908f906c65749a5fbbcc980a46e24: Failed to initialize logging driver: gelf: cannot connect to GELF endpoint: lstest_ls_1:12201 dial udp: lookup lstest_ls_1: no DNS servers
Is there another approach I should take?
