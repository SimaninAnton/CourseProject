My environment:
# docker --version
Docker version 1.12.0, build 8eab29e
# docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build f3628c7
# 
I'm trying to use external_links (Compose File Reference) like following:
# cat docker-compose.yaml 
version: '2'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    external_links:
     - mariadb
# 
and even though external_links works as expected... there is no host entry:
# docker exec -it nginx_nginx_1 cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.22.0.2  10377b7b236e
# 
How do I use extra_hosts as IP address of container is dynamic?:
# docker inspect mariadb_mariadb_1 | grep \"IPAddress
            "IPAddress": "",
                    "IPAddress": "172.21.0.2",
# 
Please advise.
