Before docker-compose version 1.5.0 whenever running docker-compose up if a single container exited with non zero exit status all containers where stopped. This was a very useful feature for us. From v1.5.0 and up after container exits with non zero code, all other containers are still left alone.
Is there any option in later versions to restore the behavior of terminating all containers on a non zero exit code from a single container?
