According to the documentation docker-compose allows to extend a configuration by using multiple configuration files.
This has become pretty handy for me. Unfortunately it does not work for all properties as expected, the extra_hosts property gets replaced instead of extended.
Please see the following MWE:
# conf1.yml
version: "2"
services:
    test:
        image: ubuntu:14.04
        expose:
            - "80"
        extra_hosts:
            - "foo:1.2.3.4"

# conf2.yml
version: "2"
services:
    test:
        expose:
            - "443"
        extra_hosts:
            - "bar:5.6.7.8"
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 6c29830
$ docker-compose -f conf1.yml -f conf2.yml config
networks: {}
services:
  test:
    expose:
    - '80'
    - '443'
    extra_hosts:
      bar: 5.6.7.8
    image: ubuntu:14.04
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
The foo entry gets removed in the extra_hosts list, but I would have expected the list to contain both hosts, foo and bar, just as it worked with expose.
Can you please check if you can modify docker-compose so it behaves the same for expose and extra_hosts and extend instead of replace the entries?
