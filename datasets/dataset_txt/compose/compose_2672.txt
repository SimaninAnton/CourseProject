I am trying to setup a docker-compose but no matter what I do, I cannot get the volumes to work.
Here is what my docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
    base:
        build: ./base
    ui:
        build: ./ui
        ports:
            - "80:80"
        volumes:
            - ./ui:/src
I have tried several different configurations of volume, but none have worked so far.
If I run my image like this then the volume is mounted correctly
docker run -it -v ui:/src 6d8e034c7fd4 /bin/bash
If I change the docker-compose.yml volume to look like this
volumes:
    - ui:/src
I get an error "Named volume "ui:/src:rw" is used in service "ui" but no declaration was found in the volumes section."
I am using Docker version 1.10.1, build 9e83765 on Windows 7
