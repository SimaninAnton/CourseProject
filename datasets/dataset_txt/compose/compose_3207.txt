I am trying to run docker-compose ps and docker-compose logs and neither are showing any output.
> sudo docker-compose -f /opt/docker-compose/server1-compose.yml ps
Name   Command   State   Ports

> sudo docker-compose -f /opt/docker-compose/server1-compose.yml logs

Both commands are returning intended output. What is wrong here?
docker-compose version: 1.4.2
Docker version 1.7.1, build 786b29d
