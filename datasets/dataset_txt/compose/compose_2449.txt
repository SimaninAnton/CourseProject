Currently if you do a docker-compose up --no-build for a docker-compose.yml file that looks like:
version: '2'

services:
  foo:
    build: "foo"
    image: foo:latest
And you're in an environment where the build folder doesn't exist, you'll get:
ERROR: build path /foo either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a valid URL.
Creating an empty directory with that name allows things to continue as expected.
I'd like to have a single docker-compose.yml file that can be used for building on the developer side and deploying on the production side. As such I never want to build in production and only use the prebuilt images, hence the '--no-build' flag. The behavior of reading the build option in this case is unexpected and counter intuitive.
It looks like this is part of the validating the config logic, which is understandable, but it would be nice if no build was plumbed down so that a missing build path was not an error.
