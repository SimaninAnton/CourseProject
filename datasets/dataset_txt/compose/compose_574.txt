While I upgrade to Macos high sierra, the docker-compose -up -d and docker-compose -down comes not work, get following ERROR from the zsh terminal：
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
:3306", should be [[remote_ip:]remote_port[-remote_port]:]port[/protocol]
:6379", should be [[remote_ip:]remote_port[-remote_port]:]port[/protocol]
But it can comes up by the Docker APP from the MacOS stock banner while stop the Docker client and restart.

it worked well before i sure, the docker-compose.yml looks like here:
ports:
  - ${REDIS_PORT}:6379
and the ./.env likes:
 # REDIS
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_IP=172.18.0.3
REDIS_PORT=6379
Now, I find back all the containers and database, after remove all the ${*} from the docker-compose.yml instead of its real name, without the .env function.
