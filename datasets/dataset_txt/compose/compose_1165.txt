When trying to use the following bind mount within a docker-compose file version 3.3:
volumes:
- type: bind
source: e:/dev/docker_shared/cache
target: /projects/install/server/jboss/bin/C:/var/local/arc/fs1
I get the following error when using docker-compose up
ERROR: for ei Cannot create container for service ei: invalid bind mount spec "/e/dev/docker_shared/cache:/projects/install/server/jboss/bin/C:/var/local/arc/fs1": invalid mode: /var/local/arc/fs1
The service installed on the container creates the directory with a colon and for now, I won't be able to change that.
Tried to escape the colon but with no success.
