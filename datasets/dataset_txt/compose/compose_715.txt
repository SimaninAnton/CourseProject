Description of the issue
I see 2 ways of mounting a tmpfs in docker-compose:
tmpfs:
  - /my/mount/point
volumes:
  - type: tmpfs
    target: /my/mount/point
Now if I want to give options for the mount point, I can do it with the first syntax:
tmpfs:
  - /my/mount/point:exec,size=1G
but I can't do it with the other syntax (or it's not documented):
      - type: tmpfs
        target: /var/tmp/portage
        ???
