Description of the issue
Here's the thing. I need to set container's env var with a value of docker network(s) where this particular container would be binded to, here's reference template:
version: '3'

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  server:
    restart: always
    image: ***
    networks:
      - my-network
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      DOCKER_NETWORKS: <here i need to set "my-network" real resource name>
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
Since compose will provision a network with a different name there is no clear way to reference a networkin name anywhere except specific fields where compose does perform name resolving.
feature proposal
At this particular moment V3 allows to set container_name, so it makes a container name static. I'd like to be able to do the same with networks.
