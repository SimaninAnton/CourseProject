For people that just are getting started with compose, the command docker-compose down can be confusing at first. We had an encounter where we did docker-compose down to stop the service. Which ended catastrophically. It would be nice if the command gave us a warning like:
$ docker-compose down
Warning this action will delete the following containers and volumes:
 - production_odoo
 - production_db
 - production_nginx
Are you sure you want to continue (Yes/No): N
$ docker-compose down -y
Stopping production_odoo
Stopping production_db
Stopping production_nginx
Removing production_odoo
Removing production_db
Removing production_nginx
Removing network production_default
And yes I know that our containers should be stateless, but sadly enough we had to learn that the hard way. It would be nice that we could warn those poor souls out there that will encounter the same thing we did.
