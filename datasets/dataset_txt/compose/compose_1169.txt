Docker on Mac
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
docker-py version: 2.5.1
CPython version: 2.7.12
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j 26 Sep 2016
docker-compose.yml:
services:
  wtf:
    image: "ubuntu:16.04"
    volumes:
      - .:/var
    working_dir: /var
    entrypoint: /bin/sh /var/starter.sh
  wtf2:
    image: "ubuntu:16.04"
    volumes:
      - .:/var
    working_dir: /var
    entrypoint: sleep infinity
starter.sh
echo "heyheyhey"

sleep infinity
now in terminal A I ran docker-compose up,
on the terminal B i ran docker-compose restart wtf repeatedly.
here's output from terminal A
each color change indicates a restart
every time the the container was restarted, the script was run more than once.
What's even stranger is that if i want to guard the other scripts from running, i tried to use a volume to map a lockfile on my host machine and setup guard in the script.
if [ ! -f setup ]; then
  echo "Running first time setup..."
  touch setup
else
  echo "NOT running first time setup"
fi

sleep infinity
This time, with each restart, there is always one script that was run that didn't acknowledge the existence of that file.
