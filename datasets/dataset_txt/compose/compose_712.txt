Description of the issue
The release notes for 1.21.0 state:
Dashes and underscores in project names are no longer stripped out.
This caused us a couple of hours of debugging time because we have lots of compose files that include things like this:
networks:
  home:
    external:
      name: homeapp_default
Which under 1.21.0 need to be specified as home-app_default because 1.21.0 no longer removes dashes. There are no errors or warnings, it just becomes impossible to resolve hostnames that were previously resolvable.
Context information (for bug reports)
Multiple compose files with network references that include the default network name in the pre 1.21.0 format (e.g. sans dashes).
