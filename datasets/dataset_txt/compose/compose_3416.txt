If you have any tasks inside your Dockerfile that require environment variables specified in the docker-compose file, they will not be found. An easy solution would be to have environment variables passed in as arguments to the docker build command, i.e.
docker-compose.yml
dev:
  build: .
  environment:
    - RACK_ENV=development
    - SESSION_SECRET=12345
As executed by docker-compose:
docker build . -eRACK_ENV=development -eSESSION_SECRET=12345
