In https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/docs/reference/overview.md it says: "Compose builds the configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and add to their successors."
If the meaning is that they override the files that come before them, then 'successors' is incorrect. A better word would be 'predecessors'.
