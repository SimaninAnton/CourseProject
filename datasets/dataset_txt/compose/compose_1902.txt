I can define a service with a volume section as:
my_server_1:
  image: yashgt/proc1
  volumes:
    - serverlog:/log
At the top level I have :
volumes:
  serverlog:
    driver: local
The physical files go to /var/lib/.... If I want to the files to go to a fixed location on the VM, I need to provide it under the volumes sections of the service as :
my_server_1:
  image: yashgt/proc1
  volumes:
    - /mydata/serverlog:/log
For each new service that wants to write to the same directory, I need to repeat the path:
my_server_2:
  image: yashgt/proc1
  volumes:
    - /mydata/serverlog:/log
It will help if we are allowed to provide the path at the top level volume definition such as :
volumes:
  serverlog:
    driver: local
    path : /mydata/serverlog
