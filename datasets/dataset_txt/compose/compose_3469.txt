This configuration setting would be used to resolve relative paths in the "volumes" property. Our use case is:
Container is running a build after git clone a repository.
This container is mounting /var/run/docker.sock to make use of docker cache between builds.
The build container does docker-compose up, but relative paths don't work as containers are created by the host docker daemon (it would have work in a docker-in-docker environment).
