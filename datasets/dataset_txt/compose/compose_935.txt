With the following docker-compose file on docker for mac edge (Docker version 17.12.0-ce, build c97c6d6 - compose version 1.18.0) fails to come up when using docker-compose up but deploys fine if using docker stack deploy.
version: "3.2"
services:
  app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - type: tmpfs
        target: /code/node_modules
I've seen two failure modes:
ERROR: for app 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
Traceback (most recent call last):
