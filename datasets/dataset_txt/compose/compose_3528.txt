How to reproduce
Start containers with docker-compose
Restart docker daemon
Docker-compose (up) will keep running, but all its containers exit
Excpected behavior: docker-compose restart its containers
Reference: #157 #1
Tested on: Both verion 1.2.x and 1.3.1 have the same behavior.
Sample error logs
From docker-compose when docker daemon has been restarted
