I have the following in docker-compose.yml:
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: app
I'm using docker-compose version 1.19.0, build 9e633ef installed via pip3.
After running docker-compose build the expected result is to have the container for app service build with --target docker argument set to app.
The actual result is
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalidbecause:
services.app.build contains unsupported option: 'target'

I've found this issue #5322 which states in comments that the build target is supported since 1.17.
Also, I've found this issue docker/docker.github.io#6036 which states that the syntax is the same as for 2.x compose file version.
