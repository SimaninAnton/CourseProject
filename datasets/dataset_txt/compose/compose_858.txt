Hello everyone,
I'm a newbie in docker and I met a problem that seems weird to me.
Here is my docker compose :
version: '2'

services:
  jekyll:
    image: .
    volumes:
      - .:/site
    ports:
      - '80:4000'
I have a dockerfile in the directory where I execute the command docker-compose up and the result is this error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "docker-compose", line 6, in <module>
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 71, in main
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 124, in perform_command
  File "compose\cli\main.py", line 959, in up
  File "compose\project.py", line 453, in up

  File "compose\service.py", line 602, in config_hash
  File "compose\service.py", line 607, in config_dict
TypeError: list indices must be integers, not unicode
Failed to execute script docker-compose
My docker version :
docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a96
docker-py version: 2.6.1
CPython version: 2.7.14
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2k  26 Jan 2017
The error is that I used "image" instead of "build" in the docker compose but when I look the error on the internet it points out to list in yaml so I was focused for awhile on the "volumes" part.
Maybe you could improve the error in order to be more explicit.
I know it's really minor but maybe this can help others :)
Have fun !
