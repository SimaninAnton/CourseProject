Hi,
I'm new on docker, and docker-compose.
After pull on some image, i search the way to configure it with docker-compose.
Where are located the image pulled on the local disk (i'm using ubuntu) ? How can i run docker-compose on an existing docker-compose.yml into this pulled image ? I don't find this information in docker manual. Can you enlight me ?
Thanks
