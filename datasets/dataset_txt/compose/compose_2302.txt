Hello,
I'm trying to have a docker compose with a container providing the connection to a VPN, and another container using that connection as the network_mode. Here's a minimal example:
services:
    openvpn-client:
        build: ./openvpn-client
        image: nitnelave/openvpn-client
        cap_add:
            - NET_ADMIN
        devices:
            - "/dev/net/tun"
        container_name: openvpn-client
    rtorrent:
        image: diameter/rtorrent-rutorrent:64
        container_name: rtorrent
        network_mode: "container:openvpn-client"
        depends_on:
            - openvpn-client
However, when I try to run docker-compose up or create, I get the following error:
ERROR: Service 'rtorrent' uses the network stack of container 'openvpn-client' which does not exist.
The problem is that it won't even pull the image if openvpn-client is not running, which makes no sense. Building the images shouldn't be a problem, for sure, and starting the images either, since I have the explicit dependency.
Any idea on how to make this work?
Thanks!
