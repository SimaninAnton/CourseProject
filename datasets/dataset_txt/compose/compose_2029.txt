I have something like this in my docker-compose.yml:
services:
    foo:
        volumes:
          - usr-local-${GIT_BRANCH}:/usr/local:ro

volumes:
    usr-local-${GIT_BRANCH}:
        external: true
It seems that docker-compose does not like the interpolated variable in the volumes section:
$ docker-compose ps
ERROR: The Compose file '/Users/.../docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
volumes value Additional properties are not allowed ('usr-local-${GIT_BRANCH}' was unexpected)
$
I'm running:
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
$
Is the interpolation of environment variables in the volumes section not supported, or am I doing something wrong in my docker-compose.yml?
