I'd like to clarify if there is any order how env-file and environment are applied.
I tried to the following:
version: '2.0'
services:
  x:
    # skipped
    env_file:
      - a.txt # setting X=0
      - b.txt # setting X=1
    environment:
      - 'X=2'
I've got 'X=2' inside the container as I expected. I'd like to be sure that it is not by an accident.
About files a.txt and b.txt it is clear as there is explicit order. The questions are following:
Is environment applied after env_file always?
Or is it because of order of env_file and environment?
