Hi!
This is my docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  admin_db:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: postgres.dockerfile
      args:
        - DB_NAME=admin_db
        - DB_USER=admin
        - DB_PASSWORD=admin_pass
    network_mode: "default"
  admin:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: admin.dockerfile
      args:
        - UID=$UID
        - GID=$GID
        - UNAME=$UNAME
    command: /bin/bash
    depends_on:
      - admin_db
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    links:
     - admin_db
    network_mode: "bridge"
If with networking_mode:"bridge" I should be able to access my app (admin) on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ from localhost, but currently, I'm able to access it only on random-ip:8000 from localhost.
I'm able to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ access when networking_mode is "host", but then I'm unable to link containers.
Is there any solution to have both things ?
linked containers
app running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ from localhost
