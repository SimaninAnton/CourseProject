Apologies if this is covered somewhere, but I wasn't able to find anything.
The new --x-smart-recreate is working really nicely for changes to running containers and new containers, but if I remove a container from container from the YAML definition it just stays running.
It'd be fantastic to support automatic removal if that's at all possible.
