The docker-compose command should support these options from the docker command:
  -H, --host=[]                      Daemon socket(s) to connect to 
  --tls=false                        Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
  --tlscacert=~/.docker/ca.pem       Trust certs signed only by this CA
  --tlscert=~/.docker/cert.pem       Path to TLS certificate file
  --tlskey=~/.docker/key.pem         Path to TLS key file
  --tlsverify=false                  Use TLS and verify the remote
This will allow you to do docker-compose $(docker-machine config dev) ... etc.
