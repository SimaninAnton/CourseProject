As I was saying in #88, for a fresh install with the curl script (at least in Debian 8), docker seems to be configured to listen on fd:// by default
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd://
However, when DOCKER_HOST is set to use fd://, docker-compose (1.4.0) complains:
fd protocol is not implemented
Maybe this issue is more linked to the docker client
