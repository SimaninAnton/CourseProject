I have something like this:
my_container:
  image: my-image
  ports:
    - "1234:1234"
  environment:
    CONTAINER_PORT: 1234
    COTANINER_ID: 3a53bcd0710
I want to be able to achieve three things:
If I scale to 2, how do I get the second container's port to change from 1234:1234 to 1235:1234
Similar to the above, how do I get the CONTAINER_PORT env var to be 1235 for the second container?
How do I get the first container to use CONTAINER_ID 3a53bcd07101 and the second to use 3a53bcd07102?
To scale further, what if I wanted 10+ of these containers?
Can these only be achieved by copying and pasting my_container 10x times?
