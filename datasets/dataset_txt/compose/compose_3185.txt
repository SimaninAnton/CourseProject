Docker Compose seems to fail getting environment variables in Windows. I'm testing on Windows 10 (not tried on any other versions of Windows). Here's a simple YML file:
test:
  image: centos:centos6
  environment:
    MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE:
Regardless of whether MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE has been set, I get the following error:
Validation failed, reason(s):
Service 'test' configuration key 'environment' 'MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE' contains None, which is an invalid type, it should be a stringnumber or a boolean
This is with Docker Compose 1.5.0rc1.
