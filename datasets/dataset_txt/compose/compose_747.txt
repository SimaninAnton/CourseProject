Description of the issue
Via docker compose it is possible to define networks and put container in them.
When two people with different unix accounts work on the same machine running docker,
the network fails with a message that the IP range is already used even when the other network has been shut down.
Please allow multiple user to use the same network or reuse already defined networks.
Two people working on the same laptop / computer have to docker network rm all the time blocking each anothers productivity.
