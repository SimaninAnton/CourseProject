I am using Docker-compose to create my app (with four services). Docker-compose version is 3.
To run services, I am using docker-compose -f up.
I am running docker in my local 4 core (intel 7).
Now I wan to assign specific CPUs to some specific services.
Will it possible to do with this setup? can you give me any link to read about it?
I try with deploy key and r√©servation. It didnt work?
Thanks for your help.
