docker-compose up is failing randomly on windows server 2016. Details below. Seems similar to 335 which was closed due to inactivity not with a resolution as far as I can see.
In my situation for the data below, I am standing up 4 or 5 services in the compose file and sometimes it succeeds and sometimes it fails. Seems quite random.
Expected behavior
docker-compose up -d --no-build should bring up multiple services defined in the docker-compose.yml file
Actual behavior
docker-compose up fails randomly with messages similar to
failed to create endpoint [[service]] on network nat
The process is failing randomly for random services.
Information
The output from the following script - https://aka.ms/Debug-ContainerHost.ps1 is
(please note that windowsservercore and nanoserver are being cleaned up by docker system prune) so the images declared in the docker-compose.yml file are being pulled when missing and in turn this dependencies are being satisfied by docker as I would expect.
