Hello there! In my docker-compose file i have many images and i want make two host folder named db and public with css and js files.
in first image with db:
    volumes:
        - './db/:/usr/local/var/lib/db'
Its ok! Create folder with name db with all files inside from image!
But second image dont do that. I do:
    volumes:
        - './public/:/app/public'
Folder creates but all files dont input on host and delete all files in image.
I use version: "2". What iam doing wrong?
