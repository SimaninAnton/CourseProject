I'd like to be able to do something like the following:
version: '2'

networks:
  net1:
    driver: custom
  net2:
    driver: custom
    opts:
      join_network: $compose_net1_name
Basically I'd like to declare a dependency where I can inject whatever the name of the created network for net1 is into the data provided to net2 when it is created.
Really, I'd like to be able to do this with everything compose creates - containers, images and volumes.
