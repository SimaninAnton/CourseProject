using compose version 1.2.0rc1, docker version 1.5.0
got this error when pulling image from private registry. The docker daemon is set with --insecure-regsitry=hostname:8443

docker.errors.DockerException: HTTPS endpoint unresponsive and insecure mode isn't enabled.
When I add --allow-insecure-ssl to the docker-compose, I get this error:
File "/code/build/docker-compose/out00-PYZ.pyz/compose.service", line 214, in recreate_containers
File "/code/build/docker-compose/out00-PYZ.pyz/compose.service", line 199, in create_container

compose.progress_stream.StreamOutputError: Authentication is required.
I confirmed that I am logged in by doing a docker pull from the private registry and it works fine.
Thanks for looking...
