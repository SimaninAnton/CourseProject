Hi there,
my docker-compose.yml is like this:
version: "3"

        build: ./mycode                                                                                                                                                                                               
        volumes:                                                                                                                                                                                                   
            - ./logs:/data/log                                                                                                                                                                                     
        ports:                                                                                                                                                                                                     
            - "80:80"                                                                                                                                                                                              
        tmpfs:                                                                                                                                                                                                     
            - /exampledir
that works. i'd like to specify the tmpfs size. There is a parameter in the Engine that is called as tmpfs-size *
I just had a look into the Docker Compose's instruction **. I didn't see such as parameter.
How can i set the tmpfs size through through the docker-compose.yml file? Is there a way to do it?
