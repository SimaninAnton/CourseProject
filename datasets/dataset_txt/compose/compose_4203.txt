Example:
foo:
    build: .
    volumes_from:
        - configs

configs:
    build: ./configs
    volumes:
        - /etc/something
If I run
fig run foo
The volume is not mounted, without any warnings. This is because it tries to iterate over the containers for configs, and none exist yet, so it just skips it and continues.
fig up
fig run foo
This works.
I propose that if there is a volumes_from a service, and there are no containers for that services, it should at lease raise a warning, but possibly error.
