$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.7.0, build 0d7bf73
$ docker-compose build -no-cache
Build or rebuild services.

Services are built once and then tagged as `project_service`,
e.g. `composetest_db`. If you change a service's `Dockerfile` or the
contents of its build directory, you can run `docker-compose build` to rebuild it.

Usage: build [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --force-rm  Always remove intermediate containers.
    --no-cache  Do not use cache when building the image.
    --pull      Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image.
$ echo $?
0
See last line - the return value should be non-zero as the current state does not work correctly with set -e.
PS: I am sorry if this is fixed in newer version, I can't test it now.
