I'm using the following Dockerfile
FROM microsoft/aspnet
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN ["dnu", "restore"]

EXPOSE 5004
And this docker-compose.yml with Docker 1.6.0 and docker-compose 1.2.0
web:
  build: .
  command: dnx . kestrel
  ports:
   - "80:5004"
When running docker-compose up -d I get the following output:
Recreating aspnet5_web_1...
As said, the container is started but also stopped immediately.
docker ps -a results in
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES

docker logs 16f2 shows normal output without errors.
As said, the container works fine running it using plain Docker.
On the other hand, the official MongoDb image also works fine with docker-compose and running a container based on it, it doesn't stop.
