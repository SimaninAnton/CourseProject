It's inspired by #527
The pull request for this proposal is #607
The main idea is to allow servie to use different Docker Hosts. To do so, I add three new parameters:
docker_host
docker_cert_path
docker_verify_tls
So we can modify our fig.yml to deploy to more than one docker host in the same time. For example,
fig.yaml:
web1:
  build: .
  command: python app.py
  docker_host: tcp://192.168.0.101:2376
  docker_cert_path: /path/to/your/cert1/directory
  docker_tls_verify: 1
  ports:
   - "8000:8000"

web2:
  build: .
  command: python app.py
  docker_host: tcp://192.168.0.102:2376
  docker_cert_path: /path/to/your/cert2/directory
  docker_tls_verify: 1
  ports:
   - "8000:8000"
We can use this fig config to deploy to both 192.168.0.101 and 192.168.0.102. For generating docker cert over SSL, please reference here
