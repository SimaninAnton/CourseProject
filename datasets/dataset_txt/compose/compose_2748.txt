I created a compose file with two service where each one has a different constraint. Each constraint specifies characteristics from different hosts.
As far as I could test, it works fine when the constraint is from the same host, but when I try to spread the containers to many hosts the swarm ends up with no host candidate.
Using different compose files I could send containers to different hosts using the constraints. The problem is when I am doing it in the same compose file.
The docker compose yml file is:
app:
  image: flask/app
  links:
    - redis
  #environment:
   # - "constraint:x.pci==fpga"
app2:
  image: flask/app
  links:
    - redis
  environment:
    - "constraint:x.storage==ssd"
haproxy:
  image: tutum/haproxy
  links:
    - app
    - app2
  environment:
    - BACKEND_PORT=5000
nginx:
  image: nginx/loadbalancer
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  links:
    - haproxy
redis:
  image: redis

ERROR: unable to find a node that satisfies x.storage==ssd
For some reason, it maybe understand the constraints from different hosts as a conflict, then in the end there is host candidate to deploy the containers. 
I have also tried to link this compose file to another container in a different host. But I got this error:
ERROR: Unable to find a node fulfilling all dependencies: --link=1f38b99b9e73:1f38b99b9e73 --link=loadbalancernginx_app_1:app --link=loadbalancernginx_app_1:app_1 --link=loadbalancernginx_app_1:loadbalancernginx_app_1
the 1f38b99b9e73 is a container in host 1 and the docker compose file has constraints to go to host2.
Thus, it seems that the problem is with links.
