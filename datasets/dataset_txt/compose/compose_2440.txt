.env file would be ignored if the working directory is different than that docker-compose.yml resides.
|-directory1
|--docker-compose.yml
|--.env
|-directory2
if you run the following command inside directory2 it won't work:
docker-compose path/to/directory1/docker-compose up -d
It shows an error saying The VARIABLE_NAME variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
However if you run the same command inside directory1 it works fine.
