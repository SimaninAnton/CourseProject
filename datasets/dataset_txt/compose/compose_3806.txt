While trying to develop a Haskell/Yesod application I found that linking containers with compose behaved differently than linking them manually with docker commands. I initially asked a stack overflow question about this, which contains the relevant detail. On giving it more thought I think this may be a bug, or perhaps related to issue 374. I will summarise my SO question here for convenience:
Linking the web app with postgres using compose up fails every time, but not always in the same way.
Bringing the database and webapp up separately with compose run partially succeeds.
Bringing the database up any way then running the web app by docker run-ning it for /bin/bash then adding environment variables and using yesod devel in the container's shell works every time.
I believe these three should exhibit equivalent behaviour, although I'd be grateful for any indication that I'm wrong.
I'll keep working on this at my end and post anything I find useful.
