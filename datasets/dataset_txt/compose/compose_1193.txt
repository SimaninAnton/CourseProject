I am currently in trouble with IP ranges that docker uses. Due to public wifi using 172.18.0.1 for login purpose I wanted to restrict docker using IP Range starting at 172.20.0.0
So I set up the /etc/docker/daemon.js
{
  "bip": "172.20.0.1/15",
  "fixed-cidr": "172.20.0.0/14",
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8::/64",
  "mtu": 1500,
  "default-gateway": "172.20.1.1",
  "default-gateway-v6": "2001:db8:abcd::89",
  "dns": ["172.20.1.2","172.20.1.3"]
}
It works very well for the docker0 bridge but every docker-compose project starts again using 172.17... and then 172.18....
Why does it ignore my config or am I missing something?
How to prevent docker in general to use those IPs?
