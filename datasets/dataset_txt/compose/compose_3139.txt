Would be nice to get a replacement for capistrano shell with docker-compose shell.
Use cases:
check if a host is reachable from all the boxes: docker-compose shell frontend ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
calculate a size of distributed cache: docker-compose shell nginx sudo du -sh /var/cache/nginx/
emergency kill all the unicorns docker-compose shell app pkill ruby
As far as all the containers started with docker-compose up foo should have the same binaries no conflicts would happen in terms of commands.
