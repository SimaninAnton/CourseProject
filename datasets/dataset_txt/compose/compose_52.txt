Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The --compatibility option is only available as an option and I find myself obliged to add it everywhere on command line or in shell scripts when I do up or run commands.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to setup compatibility mode from my .env file.
Describe alternatives you've considered
The only alternative I've come up with is to use some script wrapper to docker-compose that prepend this option.
