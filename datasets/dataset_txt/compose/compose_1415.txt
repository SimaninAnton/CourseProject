I'm having an issue when composing 2 yml files and generate config, it's removing the deploy section.
When using docker-compose config and it has a deploy section it's being removed
e.g.
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"

services:
  app:
    image: redis:alpine
    deploy:
      replicas: 4
      update_config:
        parallelism: 2
        delay: 10s

# docker-compose.override.yml
version: "3"

services:
  app:
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - DOCKER=true
# output - note deploy section is being removed
networks: {}
services:
  app:
    environment:
      ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development
      DOCKER: 'true'
    image: redis:alpine
version: '3.0'
volumes: {}
When I remove the override file or specify the config using -f it works, however when I add another file it will get removed as well.
Is there a work around this?
I'm using this in order to generate a stack file for swarm
