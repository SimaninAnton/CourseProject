It would be nice if the v2 compose file allowed a custom key on the top level which would simply be ignored by the parser and compose itself.
This would be really useful combined with YAML inheritance. For example, I have a few service definitions which need the same environment variables. Right now I have this in my first service:
    environment: &flask_env
      SECRET_KEY: ~
      SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: ~
And then this in the other services using the same ones:
    environment:
      <<: *flask_env
However, I think it would be cleaner if I could define those variables somewhere else and inherit them in all the services I use:
custom:
  flask-env: &flask_env
    SECRET_KEY: ~
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: ~
With that done I'd only need
    environment:
      <<: *flask_env
in all the service definitions.
