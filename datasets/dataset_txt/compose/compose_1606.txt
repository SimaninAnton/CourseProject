Imagine the following scenario
docker-compose file, with a client and a server service.
There is a link between client and server.
I apply scale=10
Questions:
By default, every server will be linked to each client, correct?
How the routing works? Is there any policy? How client-i-th knows which is the server-i-th to send request to?
Is there a way to link client-1 with only server-1, client-2 with only server-2 etc?
If it is already explained in the documentation, where can I find this information?
