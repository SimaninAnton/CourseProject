Windows 10.
Docker version 1.12.1, build 23cf638, experimental
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build d988a55
This is how my compose file works
 registry:
    image: registry:2.5.0
    env_file:
      - 'C:\Users\username\data\config\registry\registry.env'
    volumes:
      - '/C/Users/username/data/data/registry:/var/lib/registry'
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    ulimits:
      nproc: 163840
      nofile:
        soft: 163840
        hard: 163840
    restart: always
This is how it does not work:
C/Users/username/data/config/registry/registry.env
Since we use Puppet to generate compose file I need a unified template. Any reason why /c/User/username/ does not work? Compose says it cannot find the file. Why volumes work and env_file does not?
