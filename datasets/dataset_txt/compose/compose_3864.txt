It would be really useful if pre-build binaries of docker-compose are added to https://master.dockerproject.com. This would enable people to download a working version of the latest version for testing if they like "living on the edge".
Also useful to confirm if an issue is resolved ("could you download the latest master to check if the issue is resolved?")
