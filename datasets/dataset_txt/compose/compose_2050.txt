Hello, this error seems to have popped up multiple times, but i think that i am meeting a new flavour of it. The error appears when i run docker-compose build or other commands. Here is the full stacktrace:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 61, in main

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xef in position 5: ordinal not in range(128)
docker-compose returned -1
These are my versions:
 ~ $ python --version
Python 2.7.12
 ~ $ docker --version
Docker version 1.12.1, build 23cf638
 ~ $ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build f3628c7
I am working on Ubuntu 16.04. Where should i look?
