Currently I'm running a Docker Compose project with 20 services.
One of these services is "gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest", which is quite chatty in it's logging output.
[about 80 lines/min]
I always start my services with "docker-compose up -d" followed by a "docker-compose logs -f"
The Problem is, that after a (until now) unspecified time the logging of the "gitlab" container/service is not outputted with "docker-compose logs -f". But investigation of the actual logfile of the container/service shows that new log output is generated, but somehow ignored by "logs -f".
A termination of the command (via CTRL+C) and a new execution of the command "docker-compose logs -f" shows and follows again the output of the "gitlab" container/service for an unspecified time.
I realize that this is a specific scenario that I'm presenting. I will therefore try to find a minimal reproducible example of this behavior.
