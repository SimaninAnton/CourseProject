CLITestCase.test_events_human_readable fails due to wrong assumption that host where tests were launched will have the same date time as Docker daemon.
Example, instance works with US East coast time, but compose tests were launched at host that does have UTC + 3 date time.
So, assertion that is made assert lines[0].startswith(datetime.date.today().isoformat()) is incorrect.
