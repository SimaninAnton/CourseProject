I ran in to an issue, I'm not sure it is a compose thing but that's how I discovered it. I also commented on an older docker issue to see if they had any ideas.
I am in the process of switching from the old v1 templates to the v2 templates. I have an nginx service defined in the new template, identical in both formats:
nginx:
    image: nginx
    hostname: nginx
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      # Assets
      - "../public:/etc/nginx/www"
      # Configuration
      - "./nginx:/etc/nginx"
This definition works correctly using the v1 format but not the v2 format. I have checked that the volumes get mounted properly and indeed they do for both formats, checking with docker inspect and looking inside the container. All the networking works as I would expect as well. I am able to get the v2 container working if I exec in to the container and reload nginx (nginx -s reload). It seems like nginx starts before the mounts are visible.
I'm not sure how else to troubleshoot this, maybe there is a workaround I can use for now?
I can provide more details, I know this isn't a lot of information but I didn't want to go overboard if this isn't the correct forum to post this issue.
