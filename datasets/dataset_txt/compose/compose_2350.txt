Hi there,
I have a scenario in mind where I spin up many containers, each with just one small difference that is based on the id of the container. E.g.,
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    image: python:3-onbuild
    scale: 100
    volumes:
      - ./dir_$id:/working_dir
    working_dir: /working_dir
    command: python3 program.py
This would spin up 100 containers, each identical except that app_1 mounts dir_1, app_2 mounts dir_2, etc.
Is this currently possible with docker-compose? If it is not, would it be possible to implement this for a future release?
