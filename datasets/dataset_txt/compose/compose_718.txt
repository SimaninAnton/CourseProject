Description of the issue
In Release 1.20.0 an new feature was added
"Proxy configuration found in the ~/.docker/config.json file now populates environment and build args for containers created by Compose"
It should be possible to disable this feature at runtime, for example, with a flag
docker-compose up --no-proxy-import ......
The reason for this is that you may wish to use the proxy for docker builds, but not for all run time containers. Currently, if there is a proxy set in the config.json, it is always set in the running containers.
