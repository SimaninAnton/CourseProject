Hi,
On Mac OS 10.9.2/Python 2.7.5 I tried to install fig using
sudo pip install -U fig
When I try
fig --version
I get
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/fig", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 2603, in <module>
    working_set.require(__requires__)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 666, in require
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 565, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)  # XXX put more info here
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: six>=1.3.0,<2
I interpret this to mean that I need six version 1.3.0 or higher (but less than 2). Seems like I already have that:
$ pip freeze |grep six
Warning: cannot find svn location for mercurial==2.6.2-20130606
six==1.8.0
Any idea what the problem is? BTW, this comes after attempting the
regular install and getting Illegal instruction: 4 when trying to run the resulting binary.
