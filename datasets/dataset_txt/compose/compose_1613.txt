When configuration changes in the networks block of the docker-compose.yml it looks like docker doesn't recreate the network and apply the latest change.
Eg. running docker-compose up with the following docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - 80
      - 443
    networks:
      secret_network:

networks:
  secret_network:
results in docker ps showing that the ports are correctly exposed
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                           NAMES
f438fcb53922        nginx:alpine        "nginx -g 'daemon ..."   5 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:32805->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32804->443/tcp   insightinformatics_web_1
However, if we change the docker-compose.yml to the following and run docker-compose up again
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - 80
      - 443
    networks:
      secret_network:

networks:
  secret_network:
    internal: true    # oops, forgot this!
then docker ps shows that the ports are still exposed when they should no longer be
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                           NAMES
f438fcb53922        nginx:alpine        "nginx -g 'daemon ..."   2 minutes ago       Up 7 seconds        0.0.0.0:32807->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32806->443/tcp   insightinformatics_web_1
Manually running docker network rm insightinformatics_secret_network to remove the network, then rerunning docker-compose up has the expected effect and secret_network is now internal and docker ps shows no ports are exposed.
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
f438fcb53922        nginx:alpine        "nginx -g 'daemon ..."   6 minutes ago       Up 10 seconds                           insightinformatics_web_1
I'm not sure what expected behaviour is here, but I was expecting it to update the network config in the same way that container config would be updated if a change was made and then applied.
