Given COMPOSE_FILE can be defined in .evn file which people would distrobute with applications, it should be supported to use a separator that works across all platforms.
Right now both 1.7.0 release notes and online doc says it supports : on nix, and ; on Windows, it implies neither is supported on the opposite platforms, meaning you won't be able to distrobute your application with .env and doc instructions that works the same across all.
Suggestion: Add support for : on Windows. Find something that works on both, at least in .env
