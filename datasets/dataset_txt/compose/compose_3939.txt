It would be nice if fig could do the same as:
docker run --rm -i --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" ubuntu /bin/bash -v $PWD:/data
This way one would be able to set the same user user/group as the current user without having to set manually each time for every different user.
(using this would make the files created within the container to be with the same permission of the actual user)
