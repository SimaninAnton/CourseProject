With docker 1.9 you can connect a container to multiple networks, see docs, but how can I do this with compose?
I read through the networking section of compose, but haven't found a description about my issue.
I saw several issues and discussions, where the following syntax was mentioned:
networks:
   - myvxlan1
   - myvxlan2
What's the current way, how to join to multiple networks with compose?
