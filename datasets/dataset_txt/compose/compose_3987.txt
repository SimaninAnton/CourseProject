If I upgrade volume source docker and use fig run to start it again, it seems intermediate container cannot deal with this porperly?
e.g.
dbdata has a volume /dbdata
db1 --volume-from dbdata
if fig use docker rm dbdata and then docker run -v /dbdata --name dbdata
db1 and dbdata will not share the same volume anymore.
And, intermediate container is responsible for record only one-way (get_volumes_from) direction?
 container.start(
            links=self._get_links(link_to_self=options.get('one_off', False)),
            port_bindings=port_bindings,
            binds=volume_bindings,
            volumes_from=self._get_volumes_from(intermediate_container),
            privileged=privileged,
