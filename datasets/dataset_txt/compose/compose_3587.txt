When piping "docker-compose ps" to anything, the terminal size effects the output. For example, lets say my terminal is maximized and if I run "docker-compose up"
docker-compose up
docker ps | wc -l
8
docker-compose ps | wc -l
9
Now I shrink my terminal to half the width
docker ps | wc -l
8
docker-compose ps | wc -l
16
I need to be able to pipe the output because I am grepping it as a way to determine what a container is named after compose starts it. So I presumed it would output one container per line, but it does not.
As you can see 'docker ps' does not exhibit this behavior. It produces the same line count regardless of the terminal size.
To be clear about what I am looking for, look at 'ls'. It is terminal aware. 'ls' in a terminal show files side by side. But if you pipe it to something else, it presents files line by line which allows for further processing.
