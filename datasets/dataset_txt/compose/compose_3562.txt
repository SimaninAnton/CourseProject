When I stop and rm a container (for example, mysql), and use "up --no-recreate -d" parameter to recreate it.
Sometimes other containers (for example tomcat) link to this service may lost connection to it.
When this happened, from the bash of tomcat cannot ping the mysql container by hostname.
I checked the internal IP address of mysql, when container recreated, it's IP usually changed too.
But in this case, the tomcat's /etc/hosts file looks not updated, so...
