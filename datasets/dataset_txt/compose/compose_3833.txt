Here's my (simplified) docker-compose.yml file:
db:
  image: postgres:9.3
  ports:
    - "5432"
api:
  image: node:0.10-onbuild
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  links:
    - db
  working_dir: /app
  command: node index.js
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  environment:
    - DB_HOST=db
Sometimes I want to test my Node.js app using an external database hosted on AWS, so I use a container which is just a ssh tunnel to an external database.
db:
  image: thomass/ssh-client
  volumes:
    - ~/.ssh:/ssh
  command: "ssh -Ng -L 5432:localhost:5432 -i /ssh/identity.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@mydomain.com"
  ports:
    - "5432"
#db:
#  image: postgres:9.3
#  ports:
#    - "5432"
api:
  image: node:0.10-onbuild
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  links:
    - db
  working_dir: /app
  command: node index.js
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  environment:
    - DB_HOST=db
Right now, my workflow consists of commenting/uncommenting which db I want to use (remote or local). I was wondering if there was a better way to achieve this? Would it be possible for docker-compose to launch the right container by passing some environment variable (e.g. REMOTE=1 docker-compose up)?
