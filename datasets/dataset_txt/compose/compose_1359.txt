I hame having some weird issue now.
I have a fresh install docker with docker compose
docker version: 17.03.2-ce
docker-compose: 1.14.0, build c7bdf9e
running on ubuntu 16.04
I am trying to run the following compose file:
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: tutum/hello-world
    ports:
     - "86:80"
And I am getting port parse exception when running the command:
docker-compose -f test.yml up -d
The exception is:
ERROR: for web  expected string or bytes-like object
Traceback (most recent call last):

I have tried downgrading to 1.13.0 and issue still persists.
after downgrading to 1.7.0 it works as expected
