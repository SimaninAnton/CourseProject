When merging two files defining the same service with python 3.6, and the head defines both host and container port but the base defines only the container port, I get the following error :
(python3/6) docker-compose -f docker-compose-base.yml -f docker-compose-head.yml config
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'NoneType'
But with python 2.7 it works even though it's not merging properly but rather appending :
(python2.7) docker-compose -f docker-compose-base.yml -f docker-compose-head.yml config
networks: {}
services:
  test:
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - 80/tcp
    - 8080:80/tcp
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
And the minimal content of the files :
docker-compose-base.yml
version: '2'

services:
    test:
        image: nginx
        ports:
            - '80'
docker-compose-head.yml
version: '2'

services:
    test:
        image: nginx
        ports:
            - '8080:80'
