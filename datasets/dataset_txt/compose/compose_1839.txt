I've tried to make a service Unit to initialize some Docker images by docker-compose in Systemd. I have saw somes examples at Internet, but the only works, there is one trap...
With these harbor.service file:
[Unit]
Description=Servico de manutencao do Harbor
After=network.target docker.service
[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt//harbor
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /opt/harbor/docker-compose.yml up
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /opt/harbor/docker-compose.yml down
#Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
I start de Unit and after I receive this status:
# systemctl start harbor
# systemctl status harbor
● harbor.service - Servico de manutencao do Harbor
Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/harbor.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Mon 2016-12-19 20:09:44 BRST; 16min ago
Main PID: 2028 (docker-compose)
Memory: 34.3M
CGroup: /system.slice/harbor.service
├─2028 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /opt/harbor/docker-compose.yml up
└─2029 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /opt/harbor/docker-compose.yml up
Everything is OK, all Dockers container running. I can stop the harbor service without any problem. But now I have two docker-compose process.
Is there normal? Could I have problems in Future with these two process? How to make service Unit file better for docker-compose?
Thanks.
