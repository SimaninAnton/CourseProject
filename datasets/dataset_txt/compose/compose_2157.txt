Problem
Running Docker 1.11.2 and docker-compose 1.8.0 (problem persists after downgrading to 1.7.0), I try to update a service in a Docker 1.11.2 Swarm cluster of three nodes. The services in my docker-compose.yml have affinities to ensure that one container of each service is deployed on each node.
The compose-file
services:
  service1:
    image: myimage1:latest
    environment:
    - "affinity:com.mycompany.type!=~service1"
    - "affinity:container!=~*service1_*"
    labels:
    - "com.mycompany.type=service1"

  service2:
    image: myimage2:latest
    environment:
    - "affinity:com.mycompany.type!=~service2"
    - "affinity:container!=~*service2_*"
    labels:
    - "com.mycompany.type=service2"
Actual behaviour
This works well on initial start:
docker-compose -p myproject scale service1=3 service2=3
distributes both services nicely. But when I try to update the project running docker-compose -p myproject up -d, all recreated containers are randomly placed on the nodes, ignoring what I definied as affinities.
Expected behaviour
The containers should be recreated on the nodes they're on, or distributed again according to the definied affinities.
