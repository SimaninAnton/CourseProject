Hi,
I have a compose file like so:
printversion:
  image: jruby:1.7.24-onbuild
  command: -v
server:
  image: jruby:1.7.24-onbuild
  volumes:
    - .:/app/jruby-drb-test
  command: scripts/drb_server.rb
client:
  image: jruby:1.7.24-onbuild
  volumes:
    - .:/app/jruby-drb-test
  command: scripts/drb_client.rb
  links:
    - server
  environment:
    - runs
    - message_size
However this gives an error when running it 'up'
$ docker-compose up
Starting dockerjrubywebricktester_server_1
Container command not found or does not exist.
I have a similar compose file (https://github.com/kimptoc/docker-jruby-drb-tester) that works on OSX/Linux - is this a Windows issue perhaps?
Thanks in advance,
Chris
