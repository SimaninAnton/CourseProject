Hello,
I would like to know if it's possible, when we mount a host directory into the container to declare this volume as a named one. The idea is to allow reuse between several containers. Here is an example
version: 'X'

services:
  myservice:
    image: test/demo
    volumes:
      - config-volume:/path/in/container/config
  myotherservice:
    image: test/other
    volumes:
      - config-volume:/path/in/container/config

volumes:
  config-volume: /my/path/
but the config-volume, even when I read the docs carefully I don't see/understand a way to declare it inside the docker-volume config file. Did I miss something?
