This is very similar to #3622 .
If I have a compose service with a build clause, and the image you're building has a FROM that uses my private repository, it fails with an unauthorized error.
Compose file:
version: '2'
services:
  broken:
    build:
      context: '.'
Dockerfile:
FROM my.private.repo/image:tag
CMD ["echo", "built"]
Output:
Building broken
Step 1 : FROM my.private.repo/image:tag
ERROR: Service 'broken' failed to build: Get https://my.private.repo/v2/image/manifests/tag: unauthorized: Unauthorized
I'm using Docker for Mac, version 1.12.3 (13776). docker-compose -v: docker-compose version 1.8.1, build 878cff1
