I'm running serveral services in the output
docker-compose up service1 service2 service3
Often (not always, I think in 80% of cases) when I restart some of the service with docker-compose restart service1, console with the output is emitting the error:
File "threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner
File "threading.py", line 763, in run
 File "compose/cli/log_printer.py", line 197, in watch_ev

File "json/decoder.py", line 369, in decode
ValueError: Extra data: line 2 column 1 - line 2 column 71
0 (char 706 - 1415)
After this error is shown process doesn't exit, but not output anymore.
Tested on docker-compose 1.9.0 on linux
And appears on docker-compose 1.10.0-rc1 (docker for windows)
