After updating fig, I'm having a problem where fig seems to be caching the local working directory and using it's own version instead of using my local directory. For instance in my fig.yml I have
  volumes:
    - .:/var/www/html/
But file changes don't show in the web server.
In another project, where a volume is mounted the same way, switching branches in my local directory does not seem to update the code in the mounted volume.
Is this a new configuration item I am missing or something?
