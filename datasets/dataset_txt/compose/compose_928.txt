Dear All,
When I change my docker-compose.yml to version 3.X, I got following error:
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for services.ngrok: 'scale'
But I didn't know why the scale option is missing. I can't find scale in Compose file version 3 reference. And the upgrade guide of version 3 didn't say the removal of scale.
