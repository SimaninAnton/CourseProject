services:
  base_service:
    image: service
    build: ../../service

  service_flavorA:
    extends: base_service
    environment:
      - OPTS='my awesome service opts'

  service_flavorB:
    extends: base_service
    environment:
      - OPTS='these opts are so different from flavorA, it's crazy.'
When i run a docker-compose build it builds the base image service twice. I would expect it to only build it once. It does the same thing with the following:
version: '2'

services:
  service_flavorA:
    build: ../../service
    environment:
      - OPTS='my awesome service opts'

  service_flavorB:
    build: ../../service
    environment:
      - OPTS='these opts are so different from flavorA, it's crazy.'
