If a fifo pipe exists in the hierarchy on the same level or below docker-compose.yml, it will cause docker-compose build to hang.
How to reproduce:
Create docker-compose.yml file
mkfifo some-pipe
Build it: docker-compose build
Now it hangs while waiting for data to be available in the pipe and you can make it continue, by piping data to the pipe: echo "something" > some-pipe
