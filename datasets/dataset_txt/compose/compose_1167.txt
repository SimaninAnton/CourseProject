The following two acceptance test cases are failing for all new PRs, no matter what the source code changes are:
CLITestCase.test_build_failed (assert len(containers) == 1 fails with AssertionError: assert 3 == 1)
CLITestCase.test_build_failed_forcerm (assert not containers fails with AssertionError: assert not [<Container: affectionate_dijkstra (349f9a)>])
Both tests pass locally, is the Jenkins server keeping some state of previous builds?
Affected PRs: #5237 , #5238, #5241
