As in the subject, we have some git custom hooks based on "docker exec" which are executed by git to perform some operations, like checking coding standard.
Today i tried to use the exec command of docker-compose, but i have just this error stracktrace:
➜  www git:(dev) ✗ git commit -am "fix docker binaries as the starterkit"
