I'm trying to assign the output of docker-compose run to a variable in bash.
Currently docker-compose run can print to console stuff like:
docker-compose run serviceabc ls
WARNING: The MVN_OPT variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Starting serviceabc
dir1
dir2
dir3
Can a -s --silent or -q --quiet option be added to docker-compose run avoid printing anything other than the command output.
I guess this would also make sense for other docker-compose commands too.
