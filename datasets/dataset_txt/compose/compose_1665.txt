The support for compose with docker stack deploy in 1.13 is absolutely wonderful. It would be just that much more wonderful if we didn't need to do a ton of these after deploying:
docker service update --secret-add DB_USER web
docker service update --secret-add DB_PASS web
docker service update --secret-add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID web
docker service update --secret-add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY web

docker service update --secret-add DB_USER celery
docker service update --secret-add DB_PASS celery
docker service update --secret-add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID celery
docker service update --secret-add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY celery

...etc
Granted these can somewhat be combined, but it's still cumbersome.
Something like this would be amazing:
version: '3'
services:
    web:
        ...
        deploy:
            ...
            secrets:
                - DB_USER
                - DB_PASS
                - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
                - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
