Starting at around version 17.05.0-ce it seems that services cannot be created using internal overlay networks. This used to work in previous versions.
Here is a short example compose file, docker-compose-internal-network.yml, that demonstrates the problem:
version: '3.1'
services:
  linux:
    image: alpine:3.5
    networks:
      - network_internal
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
networks:
  network_internal:
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
    internal: True
Running stack deploy with this compose file generates the following:
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-internal-network.yml test
Creating network test_network_internal
Creating service test_linux
Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = 3 desc = Service cannot be explicitly attached to "test_network_internal" network which is a swarm internal network
