Foreword
Since issue #563 is closed I'm opening a new one, @GordonTheTurtle feel free to close it and re-open the previous one.
Environment
Docker 1.7.0, compose 1.3.1 on MacOSX with Boot2docker from Homebrew
Does not happen on Ubuntu 14_04.
How to reproduce
From a minimal docker-compose.yml:
server:
    image: jfrog-docker-registry.bintray.io/artifactory/artifactory-oss
docker-compose up does not work:
/usr/local/Cellar/fig/1.3.1/libexec/vendor/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:90: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.

The problem does not happen if the image is pulled before using `docker pull jfrog-docker-registry.bintray.io/artifactory/artifactory-oss``
