I'm working on packaging docker-compose 1.9 for RHEL/CentOS 7 (via EPEL). The system version of python-requests is 2.6.0, but docker-compose has a minimum version of 2.6.1. The commit setting that version doesn't make specific mention of why that exact version was necessary. Can anyone shed any light on specific features and/or bug fixes that exist in 2.6.1 that are missing from 2.6.0? Perhaps 2.6.0 will work, and if a specific feature/bug fix is known then I can request Red Hat backport it to their package.
