Hi folks.
I use Windows and I have a problem with docker-compose build. It returns an error:
"Cannot locate specified Dockerfile"
It workds under Linux.
After some research here is what I thought the problem is:
Here is the output from docker-compose config
 cache_manager:
    build:
      context: C:\Users\...
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_cache_manager
    volumes:
    - /c/Users/...
The file paths for context and volumes have different styles.
In compose/config/types.py there is a function normalize_paths_for_engine used by VolumeSpec.parse. This function converts Windows paths to be a Linux style paths and then volumes have a proper output in docker-compose config. It is used for volume paths, but not for build contexts.
