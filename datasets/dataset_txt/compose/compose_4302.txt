Just raising this as an issue because I'm working on it now, but probably can't merge in the short term.
Fig is bundling an older, patched version of docker inside the source tree (along with six). This is obviously not a sustainable solution, as the source trees diverge and it makes it difficult for contributors to use their additions/fixes to the official docker-py in fig. This happened yesterday when I submitted a PR to docker-py to add resize() for the TTY resizing, but fig will not be able to use it.
I've removed the fig/packages directory, added the official docker-py to requirements.txt and adjusted imports accordingly. With some minor changes to fig (camel-casing in the JSON for Id instead of ID, as per changes made in Docker 0.12.0, and only passing volumes_from=x in the start() call), fig "just works". The problem right now is that it doesn't work with 0.3.1, which seems to be the most recent release of docker-py. It only works against docker-py @ master (0.3.2-dev). This is due to the docker.errors module not existing in 0.3.1.
I'll check in with the docker guys to see when they're likely to make a new release, then send through my changes as a PR once a new release is out.
