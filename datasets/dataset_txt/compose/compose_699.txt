This usually indicates corruption in your gcloud installation or problems with your Python interpreter.

Please verify that the following is the path to a working Python 2.7 executable:
    /usr/bin/python2

If it is not, please set the CLOUDSDK_PYTHON environment variable to point to a working Python 2.7 executable.

If you are still experiencing problems, please reinstall the Cloud SDK using the instructions here:

Context information (for bug reports)
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.21.1, build 5a3f1a3Output of "docker-compose version"
$ docker --version
Docker version 18.03.0-ce, build 0520e24
$ docker-compose config
services:
  hello-world:
    image: gcr.io/library/hello-world
version: '3.0'
Steps to reproduce the issue
After installing the Linux pyinstaller release:
wget -O $HOME/.local/bin/docker-compose https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.1/docker-compose-Linux-x86_64
chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/docker-compose
and setting up gcloud credential helper in ~/.docker/config.json:
{
  "credHelpers": {
    "gcr.io": "gcloud"
  }
}
Trying to pull images (docker-compose pull) for the following sample docker-compose.yaml:
version: "3"
services:
  hello-world:
    image: gcr.io/library/hello-world
fails with the above traceback.
