when using docker-compose scale service=2 docker will claim it has spun up service_1 and service_2 but upon running docker ps or connecting to one of the linked machines to see the hosts entries, it has instead created service_2 and service_3
Obviously this causes problems when trying to configure things to talk to each other.
