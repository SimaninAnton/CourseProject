Our idea was to bundle some configuration settings in a config.yml
web:
  volumes:
   - ../development:/srv    
   - ../logs:/logs        
and extend the services in docker-compose.yml like that
hal1:
  build: phpBuild/
  extends:
    file: config.yml
    service: web
  restart: always
  command: supervisord
but this is not working.
For absolute path in config.yml it work's.
Both files are in the same directory.
