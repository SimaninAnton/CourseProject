With v2 I had the following setup:
A "code" container, where I bake the source code of my app into. This container specifies a volume using the VOLUME keyword.
A php-fpm (and a few other) container that gets my application's source code via volumes_from: code.
If I change my source code I rebuild the code container, push and pull it and rebuild my docker-compose services.
version: '2'
services:
    code:
        image: custom/backend:latest

    php-fpm:
        image: php-fpm:latest
        volumes_from:
            - code
This is the workflow described here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/creating-and-mounting-a-data-volume-container
With v3, since volumes_from is gone, I am unable to recreate this setup. What are my options? It was very easy to deploy new code by simply baking it into a new container. I have no idea how to solve this problem with v3.
