Currently compose outputs a warning when using extensions other than .yml for the config file:
WARNING: Please be aware that .yml is the expected extension in most cases, and using .yaml can cause compatibility issues in future.
However, the creators of YAML request that we use .yaml when possible. [1]
Additionally, I don't think it's fruitful to warn users about this particular "compatibility issue"; things like which character is used for \n in text files or using uppercase or non-ASCII characters in file names can also be "compatibility issues" when multiple platforms are involved, yet most programs don't force a user of a particular platform to use a convention which is compatible with other platforms.
Just my two cents. If the devs agree that this can/should be removed, I'll make a PR.
