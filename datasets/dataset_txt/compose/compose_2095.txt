Hello,
I've a Docker composer file similar to:
version: '2'
services:
    db:
        image: mariadb:10.1
        volumes:
            - "./.data/db:/var/lib/mysql"
        restart: always
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: test
            MYSQL_DATABASE: test
            MYSQL_USER: test
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: test
    test:
        depends_on:
            - db
        links:
            - db:db
        build:
            context: .
            args:
                MYSQL_HOST: db
                MYSQL_DATABASE: test
                MYSQL_USER: test
                MYSQL_PASSWORD: test
        ports:
            - "8000:80"
        restart: always
Inside test container Dockerfile:
FROM ...

...
ARG MYSQL_HOST 127.0.0.1

RUN set -x; echo $MYSQL_HOST

RUN script ... --param $MYSQL_HOST
However MYSQL_HOST variable (which I would expect to be the internal IP of the other container) is not being translated into the other container name.
There might be a way to be done as it is retrieved by doing:
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' db
?
