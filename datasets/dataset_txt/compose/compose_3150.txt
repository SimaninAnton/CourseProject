I just accidentally typed
volumes: /data
instead of
volumes:
 - /data
I'd have expected it either to work, or to produce an error message along the lines of "list expected, got string instead". Instead it appears to just blindly iterate over "/data", because the actual output is:
System error: mounting into / is prohibited
