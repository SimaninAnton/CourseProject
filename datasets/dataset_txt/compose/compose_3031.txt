I use the same compose file to deploy 2 servers the only difference between the two servers are the envs set in the env file so that I can use and maintain only one compose file
env_file:
- env
the env file has
INTERNAL_IP=............
I use 2x lsyncd containers to keep some files synced between 2 hosts so I use the INTERNAL_IP to set them to listen only on the internal ip
instead I am hoping that docker-compose can parse the env file first so that I can use something like
ports:
- "${INTERNAL_IP}:11211:11211"
