By following the examples in the documentation page, I have the following block in my docker-compose.yml file:
networks:
   default:
    driver: overlay
But when I try to do docker-compose build, I got this error:
Unsupported config option for services.networks: 'default'
What does this mean? the version of my docker-compose is 1.8.1 by the way. Thanks
