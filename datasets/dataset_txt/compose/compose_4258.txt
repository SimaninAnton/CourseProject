write two services for examle: web and db as following:
db:
    image: dbimage

web:
     image: webimage
    links:
        - db
run fig up -d
run docker ps you will find it is correct. its output is:
webimage  /run.sh     80/tcp              ttt_web_1                                    
dbimage   /run.sh     3306/tcp            ttt_db_1,ttt_web_1/db_1,ttt_web_1/ttt_db_1 
which is conflict with the docker official document here.
