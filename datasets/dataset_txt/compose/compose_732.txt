Description of the issue
We're running docker-compose on CentOS. The pip version when installed with --upgrade changed to 10.0.0 in the last couple days and our docker install (pip install docker-compose) began failing with the following message. It appears that pip 10.0.0 has increased the version dependency of package requests to 2.6.0, which is incompatible with the default docker-compose installation.

Install CentOS 7
yum install -y epel-release
yum install -y python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install docker-compose
Observed result
Install fails
Expected result
Install succeeds
Stacktrace / full error message
$ pip install docker-compose
...
  Found existing installation: requests 2.6.0
Cannot uninstall 'requests'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.
Additional information
OS version / distribution, docker-compose install method, etc.
