Hi,
I have an OpenVPN container and would like to use the connection with other containers. The command line below works fine but I can't figure out how to configure it in a v2 compose file:
docker run --rm -it --net container:openvpn_hotel_1 sander85/rpi-busybox
Docker: 1.10
Compose: 1.6.0
Thanks!
