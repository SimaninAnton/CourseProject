To reproduce:
Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:
version: '2'

services:
    my_service:
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        image: my/image
Running docker-compose pull --ignore-pull-failures prints out the expected ERROR output (
ERROR: b'repository my/image not found: does not exist or no pull access'),
And returns the unexpected 1 status code :(.
This worked well in versions 1.12.x, but stopped working once updated to 1.13
