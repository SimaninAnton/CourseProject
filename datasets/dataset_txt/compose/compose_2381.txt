I have two directories containing scripts for initializing and updating a PostgreSQL database and one with utility libraries. In the volumes section, I have mounted them as:
      - ./db/compose/utils:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/utils
      - ./db/compose/init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
      - ./db/compose/update:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
Only the first and last ones seem to be mounted. If I switch the middle and last one around, then the same is true -- only the first and last ones get mounted.
I haven't seen this before so am wondering why this would be the case.
