Hi !
I'm using docker compose for my project.
All my api keys are stored in a local file (ignored by git) and I inject it into my project with env_file in my docker-compose.yml.
Most of those variables are only for production, you can run the project with the file empty.
The problem is, I can't start my container if the file doesn't exist.
It could be a good idea to add a parameter to env_file to make it optional.
Cheers !
Dorian
