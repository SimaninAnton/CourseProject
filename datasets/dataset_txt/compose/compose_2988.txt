In previous version 1.5.1 was working. Tested in two computers, in one directly with 1.5.2, in the other was working with 1.5.1 after update to 1.5.2, no.
So it stops because of the timeout
Example output, but here you cannot see nothing strange:
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping pep-container ... done
Stopping idm ... done
