Goal
The ability to declare default environment variables in custom env file.
Current
ability to define in .env file
defined here https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/
Request
ability to define custom file
Issue
.env should not be committed to the repository
developers are frustrated when docker-compose up doesn't work out of the box, first have to figure out which environment variables are required, then decided what values to use.
Use case
We define the port in the .env file and would like that to persist between developer machines without the requirement of creating or knowing what environment values to use.
Open for suggestions and alternatives. Thanks for your time!
