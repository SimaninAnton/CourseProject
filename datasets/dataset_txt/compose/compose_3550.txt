Using the latest version of Docker/Machine/Compose, trying to $ docker compose build a Dockerfile that is FROM a private base image hosted on Docker Hub doesn't work anymore:
$ docker-compose --verbose build app

Compose version 1.3.0
Docker base_url: https://192.168.148.247:2376
Docker version: KernelVersion=4.0.5-boot2docker, Os=linux, ApiVersion=1.19, Version=1.7.0, GitCommit=0baf609, Arch=amd64, GoVersion=go1.4.2
Building app...
docker build <- (nocache=False, stream=True, tag=u'my_project_app', rm=True, path='/Users/adam/my-project/app', dockerfile=None)
docker build -> <generator object _stream_helper at 0x10f2bd640>
Step 0 : FROM my-repo/my-private-image:latest
Pulling repository my-repo/my-private-image
Service 'app' failed to build: Error: image my-repo/my-private-image:latest not found
$ docker pull my-repo/my-private-image works as expected, but Compose still tries & fails to pull the image after this due to #1568.
Specifying the same private image directly in docker-compose.yml works totally fine:
privatetest:
  image: my-repo/my-private-image
$ docker-compose pull privatetest

Pulling privatetest (my-repo/my-private-image:latest)...
latest: Pulling from my-repo/my-private-image
