Hi,
I'm not sure if this is possible currently to solve with ENV variable.
I need to have docker-compose yaml that has optional volume mounting.
For example I could mount local version of docker binary into the container on demand.
so I can't use:
export OPT_PATH=/usr/local/bin/docker
  volumes:
   - ${OPT_PATH}:${OPT_PATH}
because if variable is not set - it generates errors.
I can't use ENV variable for the whole line either - since it breaks yaml structure:
export VOLUME_DOCKER='- "/usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/local/bin/docker" '
...
  volumes:
    ${VOLUME_DOCKER}
If only there was an additional flag like ignore or disable,
I would be able to describe the mount point,
and enable it on demand and still have a one common deployment plan:
export FLAG=ignore:
  volumes:
   - /tmp:/tmp:ignore
   - /usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/local/bin/docker:ro:${FLAG}
