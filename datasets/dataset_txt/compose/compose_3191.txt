I have some Dockerfiles with the new LABEL statement in them. I've built some images out of those Dockerfiles. When I start the containers using docker-compose, the labels are completely replaced with docker-compose specific ones.
Is this intentional? Am I wrong to expect the image labels to still be there, without copy-pasting them in the "labels" section of docker-compose.yml?
