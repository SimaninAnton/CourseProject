Description of the issue
docker-compose is not creating the user defined network present in a file which another service inherits from. In my example I create a service base-service which is supposed to attach to a user defined network called my_net. When this base service is inherited from, docker-compose does not create the user-defined network.
Base file (docker-compose-base.yml)
version: '2.1'
networks:
  my_net:

services:
  base-service:
    networks:
      - my_net
Service file (docker-compose-main.yml):
version: '2.1'
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    entrypoint: sleep 3600
    extends:
      file: docker-compose-base.yml
      service: base-service
Output of docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880f
Output of docker-compose config
(Make sure to add the relevant -f and other flags)
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-main.yml config
services:
  test:
    entrypoint: sleep 3600
    image: ubuntu
    networks:
      my_net: null
version: '2.1'
** Error message **
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-main.yml up -d
ERROR: Service "test" uses an undefined network "my_net"
I'm guessing my_net: null is most likely an indication of an issue/bug
