I first run up command and later use scale to increase the number of services. The output is inconsistent. The new containers are not shown in the output either.
docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml scale zookeeper=2 kafka=3
Starting docker_zookeeper_1 ... done
Creating and starting 2 ... done
Starting docker_kafka_1 ... done
Creating and starting 2 ... done
Creating and starting 3 ... done
The output would be consistent and more descriptive as
docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml scale zookeeper=2 kafka=3
Starting docker_zookeeper_1 ... done
Creating and starting docker_zookeeper_2 ... done
Starting docker_kafka_1 ... done
Creating and starting docker_kafka_2 ... done
Creating and starting docker_kafka_3 ... done
