Here is my configuration:
# docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
    hello:
        image: alpine
        network_mode: bridge
# docker-compose.override.yml
version: '2'

services:
    hello:
        volumes:
            - .:/mnt
Everything is ok with regular docker-compose.yml...
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml config
networks: {}
services:
  hello:
    image: alpine
    network_mode: bridge
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
But using docker-compose.override.yml drops network_mode, see...
docker-compose config
networks: {}
services:
  hello:
    image: alpine
    volumes:
    - /tmp/foo:/mnt:rw
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
I guess this is a bug, anybody can help me to bypass this?
