I have a docker-compose.yml script with two services in it. The first service is a NODEJS service and second service is a HAPROXY service that fronts NODEJS service.
My versions are:
Docker version 1.12.5, build 7392c3b
docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
The inter-container linking from HAPROXY to NODEJS is not working and here is the docker-compose.yml script:
version: '2'

services:
  # The NODEJS service for application.
  svc_nodejs:
    image: node:6.9.2-alpine
    volumes:
      - $PWD:/code
#    ports:
#      - 7777:7777 # Don't give a port mapping container, so Docker can be scaled out with its dynamic port assignment.
    command: npm install
    entrypoint:
      - node
      - /code/server.js

  # The HAPROXY service to provide high-availability, load balancing and proxying to NODEJS service.
  svc_haproxy:
    image: dockercloud/haproxy
    depends_on:
      - svc_nodejs
    links:
      - svc_nodejs
    environment:
      - DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
      - DOCKER_HOST
      - DOCKER_CERT_PATH
#    volumes:
#      - $DOCKER_CERT_PATH:$DOCKER_CERT_PATH
    ports:
      - 80:80
Please let me know if i am missing any steps.
Thanks,
Venky.
