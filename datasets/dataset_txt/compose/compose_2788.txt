When I do a docker-compose rm it just shows a new empty line and then nothing.
By trial and error I found out that the "Are you sure?" question doesn't display but it waits for input.
Look at the flow below...
$ docker-compose rm
y
Removing afdriftmysql_phpmyadmin_1 ... done
Removing afdriftmysql_db_1 ... done
Going to remove afdriftmysql_phpmyadmin_1, afdriftmysql_db_1
Are you sure? [yN]
I would expect the question to be asked before having to answer it.
