Hi,
I am experiencing a problem with the command docker-compose.
I am on OS X 10.10.5, I just installed the new Docker Toolbox and try to run a docker-compose up and I got an Illegal instruction: 4 error.
Even if I do a simple docker-compose --version I got the same error. I tried to install by the CURL way and I've got the same error again.
