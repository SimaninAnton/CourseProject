Hi!
I tried to convert a docker-compose file from v1 file v2.
I got no error while building in both case.
When I launched my container with "docker-compose up..." it was working well with v1, but I got an error with v2 (see below).
I thought it was by docker-compose.yml which contained error.
But I tried to build and launch another very simple project from github:
https://github.com/stcalica/docker-rabbit
And I experience the same error:
docker-compose up
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 58, in main

docker.errors.InvalidVersion: inspect_network is not available for version < 1.21
docker-compose returned -1
Here are my versions of Docker and docker-compose:
Engine version
[__]$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      1.11.1
 API version:  1.23
 Go version:   go1.5.4
 Git commit:   5604cbe

Server:
 Version:      1.11.1
 API version:  1.23
 Go version:   go1.5.4
 Git commit:   5604cbe
 Built:        Tue Apr 26 23:30:23 2016

Compose version
[__]$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35
docker-py version: 1.8.1
CPython version: 2.7.9
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
Python bindings
[__]$ pip list | grep docker
docker-compose (1.7.1)
docker-py (1.8.1)
dockerpty (0.4.1)
It seems that the problem comes from Docker Client API... But I can't find how to solve that.
I tried to reinstall both Docker and docker-compose but this didnt solved the problem.
Any idea?
