Description of the issue
I have installed Docker Toolbox 18.09.3 which comes with Docker Compose 1.23.2 on a Windows 7 machine. I'm unable to run any docker-compose commands. All commands fail with the message:
Error loading Python DLL 'C:\Users\xyz\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI30322\python36.
dll'.
LoadLibrary: The specified procedure could not be found.
I'm running all the commands from Docker QuickStart Terminal.
I have tried upgrading to 1.24.1, but the issue still persists.
I have referred to issues #6323, #5834 for help, but nothing seems to solve the issue.
When I try to run docker-compose.exe through GUI, I get the following error dialog:
While keeping the dialog open, if I look into ..\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEIxyz\ folder, I'm able to find both the python36.dll as well as the api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll
