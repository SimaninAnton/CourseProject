Hi there, Greetings.
I am using docker-compose on GCP and exposing two ports with same server port numbers(80).
However, when I am exposing external ports, port conflict is happening. Can you please advise how I can fix it? Example for the images and ports mentioned below.
wordpress:
image: wordpress
ports:
- 80:80
phpmyadmin:
image: corbinu/docker-phpmyadmin
ports:
- 80:80
However, qhen I run in Localhost, it works fine with different port numbers(e.g. 8282 & 8181)
wordpress:
image: wordpress
ports:
- 8282:80
phpmyadmin:
image: corbinu/docker-phpmyadmin
ports:
- 8181:80
