Hi,
For the Debian package of Docker Compose in Stretch (Debian Testing), a manual page was written by Dariusz Dwornikowski dariusz.dwornikowski@cs.put.poznan.pl. You can get it at:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=31;filename=docker-compose.1;att=1;bug=792518
It would be great if you could include it upstream.
Regards,
Carl Chenet chaica@debian.org
