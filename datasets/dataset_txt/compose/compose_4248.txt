I have a MySQL container that takes a little time to start up as it needs to import data.
I have an Alfresco container that depends upon the MySQL container.
At the moment, when I use fig, the Alfresco service inside the Alfresco container fails when it attempts to connect to the MySQL container... ostensibly because the MySQL service is not yet listening.
Is there a way to handle this kind of issue in Fig?
