Here’s an example Compose file defining two custom networks:
basic.yml
version: '2'

services:
  proxy:
    build: ./proxy
    networks:
      - front
  app:
    build: ./app
    networks:
      - front
      - back
  db:
    image: postgres
    networks:
      - back

networks:
  front:
    external:
      name: front_network
  back:
    external:
      name: back_network
basic.dev.yml
version: '2'

services:
app:
   ports:
     - "80:8080"
When docker-compose -f basic.yml -f basic.dev.yml up is executed, the mapping no works
but, when create and later start are executed, the mapping works.... or maybe not
