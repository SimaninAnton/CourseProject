While trying to emulate the upcoming 'networks' option by binding networks to a single container with the following docker-compose.yml:
seleniumLocalhost:
    image: ubuntu:14.04

seleniumChrome:
    image: selenium/node-chrome:2.45.0
    links:
        - seleniumHub:hub
    net: container:seleniumLocalhost

seleniumFirefox:
    image: selenium/node-firefox:2.45.0
    links:
        - seleniumHub:hub
    net: container:seleniumLocalhost

seleniumHub:
    image: selenium/hub:2.45.0
I get the following output with docker-compose up:
Creating dockerseleniumseed_seleniumLocalhost_1...
Creating dockerseleniumseed_seleniumHub_1...
Creating dockerseleniumseed_seleniumChrome_1...
Warning: Service seleniumLocalhost is trying to use reuse the network stack of another service that is not running.
Creating dockerseleniumseed_seleniumFirefox_1...
Warning: Service seleniumLocalhost is trying to use reuse the network stack of another service that is not running.
which results in only seleniumHub, seleniumChrome and seleniumFirefox actually being run. seleniumLocalhost is dropped.
As seleniumLocalhost is not running a custom network option, the error message does not seem to make sense.
It is possible I have misunderstood how this is intended to work. Any help is much appreciated.
