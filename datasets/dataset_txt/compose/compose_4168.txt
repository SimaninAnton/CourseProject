It seems like fig will process services containing "image" before "build".
This is not what you want... I expect the services to be processed in the same order they are listed in fig.yml. First, you want to make sure your images are created, before you actually try to create the containers.
I have the following fig.yml:
ubuntu:
  build: dockerfiles/ubuntu
dbvol:
  image: projectname_ubuntu
  volumes:
   - volumes/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
The ubuntu service should to be created first ( since project name is projectname, the image name should be "projectname_ubuntu"
However, this is not what happens:
$ fig up -d
Creating projectname_dbvol_1...
Pulling image projectname_ubuntu...

As you can see, fig tries to create the dbvol service before ubuntu. It fails because it can't find the projectname_ubuntu image
fyi :
$ fig --version
fig 0.5.2
