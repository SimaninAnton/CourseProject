My container running depends on a package which is already added to images,
in that package contains a symbolic link point to /code, which will be used in runtime.
for example these is copy to image, in Dockerfile I used COPY gopath /gopath
   /gopath
       /foo.com/
            bar/
            foobar/ ----> /code
foobar point to /code, this folder is used in runtime
This works fine using docker's client, but when I put it to fig.yml
publisher:
    build: .
    environment:
        CONFIG_PATH: /etc/rest/publisher.json
    volumes:
        - ./code:/code
and fig up, I found the foobar is missing!
