Hello!
I have a nextcloud installation, and I notice that once the size of your volumes gets big (20GB) updating the container images using
docker-compose build --pull
becomes very slow (tens of minutes) on linux. Is that normal behaviour?
My volumes are mapped to host directories.
I can fix the issue by temporarily moving the volumes folders before running the command, but ideally, I wouldn't have to do that.
Cheers!
