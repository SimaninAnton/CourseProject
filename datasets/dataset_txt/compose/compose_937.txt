I'd like to make a docker-compose.yml containing something like this:
services:
  desktop:
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:"./chrome.json"
This would correspond to the docker run option --security-opt seccomp:./chrome.json, where chrome.json is this seccomp profile.
Is there any way to give the seccomp key an arbitrary JSON string?
