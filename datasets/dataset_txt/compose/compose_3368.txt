I use such file structure:
project
|-environments
|-|-environment_name
|-|-|-docker-compose.yml
|-|-|-Dockerfile
It gives me (theoretical) possibility to run different environments (devel, test, stage, prod) easy.
When running docker-compose -f environments/production/docker-compose.yml up dockerfile's context is stil the same directory where the file is placed, not the call directory.
This is a problem because it makes impossible to properly add files to container.
Adding to compose of this:
web:
  build: ../../
  dockerfile: environments/production/Dockerfile
Doesn't help
Really in this case Dockerfile's context should be the call directory
