I use in docker compose :
services:
    apache:
        networks: [front, app]
        ports: [ "0.0.0.0:80:80" ] 
but this is not equivalent to
docker service create --publish mode=host,target=80,published=80
Actually, i must delete the service created with docker deploy and recreate it with docker service create. Exist-it another solution to provide the same behavior with a good docker-compose.yml.
