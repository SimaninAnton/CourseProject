The only other issue related is #1485, but I tried their solution and it did not work.
I'm using Docker 1.7.0 on Arch Linux. It took me a while to find out how to install compose, and in the end I used
sudo pip install docker-compose
Which installed docker-compose 1.3.1 for me. I ran the command docker-compose and it worked fine. But trying an further command like docker-compose build or docker-compose up, I always get the same error message:
$ docker-compose up
Traceback (most recent call last):

Anyone can help me out there?
