In my compose file I have:
my_server:
image: yashgt/proc1:latest
command: "2"
docker-compose up treats the command as the executable. I get an error that says:
ERROR: for my_server Cannot start service my_server: oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused "exec: "2": executable file not found in $PATH"
There should be a way to retain the entrypoint defined in the dockerfile and only pass a runtime argument to it from the compose file.
