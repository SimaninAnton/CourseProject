Using variable substitution and format versions 1 and 2 (I don't have 2.1 available), a false variable-not-set WARNING and erroneous 'Defaulting to a blank string' message are output when variable is set via -e / --env and run and up are invoked.
E.g.
version: "2"

services:
  app:
    image: alpine
    environment:
      FOO: "${FOO}" # and same results for $FOO and ${FOO}, quoted and unquoted
$ echo $FOO # nothing up this sleeve
=>
$ docker-compose run -e "FOO=BAR" app sh
=> WARNING: The FOO variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
/ # echo $FOO
=> BAR
Experiencing this w/ Compose versions 1.7.1 and 1.9.0.
Expected result: no WARNING about variable not being set when variable is set via -e.
Compose is an awesome tool, thanks!
