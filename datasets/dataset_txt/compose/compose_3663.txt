I frequently get a timeout when trying to bring a few docker containers up with docker-compose up. I cannot figure out if this is related to my private repository server (which really should be fast enough) or if this is a resource problem on my local machine (for testing I create virtualbox swarm) Maybe some of you know what might wrong Here is the error output I get when the timeout appears
