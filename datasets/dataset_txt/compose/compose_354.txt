Recently, I was leveraged spring boot and spring cloud to create those micro services including eureka server,config server and other applications in our company, and each of micro service built a stand docker image, In the process of container startup, It took about 10 minutes or even more for all the applications to fully launch, I think it is a much uncontrollable thing for project deployment team when deploying the project in a new environment, since I don't know what happened in the startup process, so I hope some of them to start in a certain order, It can effectively reduce startup time (ps : via docker swarm to manage our containers) , for example, the config server can only be started if the eureka server started fully and its service is available, and the official tutorial provide an approach to resolve it, However, after my verification,it not working in docker version 3, Can you please tell me what should I do or some valuable advice?
