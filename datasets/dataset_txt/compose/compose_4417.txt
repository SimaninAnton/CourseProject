I'd like to not change any of my env variable code in my app and be able to do something like this:
web:
  build: .
  ports:
   - 8000:8000
  links:
   - db
  environment:
   DATABASE_URL: mysql://user:password@${DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR}/db
db:
  image: orchardup/mysql
Is there a way to do this currently with the linked ports? If not, is there any interest in this? I'd like to implement it there is a second person that would find it useful.
