Hi, I am wanted to use this command to generate a configuration file from a template, but something went wrong.
$ cat > tpl.yml <<'EOF'
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    image: $IMG
    restart: always
EOF
$ IMG=alpine:latest docker-compose -f tpl.yml config >out.yml
$ docker-compose -f out.yml config
ERROR: Validation failed in file './b.yml', reason(s):
services.test.restart contains an invalid type, it should be a string
Content of out.yml file:
networks: {}
services:
  test:
    image: alpine:latest
    restart:
      MaximumRetryCount: 0
      Name: always
version: '2.0'
volumes: {}
The 'restart' option should be serialized back to string. Like 'always:0' i think
Thanks!
