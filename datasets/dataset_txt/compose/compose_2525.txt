Using: 1.7.0-rc1
(Docker 1.11.0-rc3 via boot2docker)
To duplicate:
version: '2'

volumes:
  myvol:
    driver: local

services:
  foo:
    image: alpine
    volumes:
      - myvol:/opt/foo
    command: sh -c 'echo hi from foo >>/opt/foo/out'

  bar:
    image: alpine
    volumes:
      - myvol:/opt/bar
    command: sh -c 'echo hi from bar >>/opt/bar/out'

  quux:
    image: alpine
    volumes:
      - myvol:/some/arbitrary/dir
    command: sh -c 'cat /some/arbitrary/dir/out'
Running from a fairly clean daemon state (no volumes or containers):
$ docker-compose run foo
Creating volume "demo_myvol" with local driver
$ docker-compose run bar
$ docker-compose run quux
hi from foo
hi from bar
hi from bar
Seems there was an extra run of bar that wasn't asked for.
If I clean up and try again, it seems there is an equal chance that foo, bar, or both, have been accidentally run more times than requested.
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) && docker volume rm demo_myvol
