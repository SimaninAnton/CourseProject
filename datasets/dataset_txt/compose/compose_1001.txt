Hi!
Just wanted to report that docker-compose 1.18 is not compatible with docker 2.4.2 which is now in the openstack-pike upper constraint file, which is the reason i'm on this docker version
https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/requirements/plain/upper-constraints.txt?h=stable/pike
Here's my error
ERROR: for ....  __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mounts'
Traceback (most recent call last):

    sys.exit(main())

Works fine with latest docker (2.6.1)
Works fine with last docker-compose (1.17.1)
Thank you for your great work!
