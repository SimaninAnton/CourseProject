The problem is when I try to use the long syntax present in version 3.2.
I've searched but not found anything related to this in the open issues.
Using the same code as in file reference, but getting this error message.
Here is a screenshot with more information about the versions on my machine.
docker: 17.06.0-ce, build 3dfb8343
docker-compose: version 1.15.0, build e12f3b9
