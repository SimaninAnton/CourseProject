If a volume is created with docker-compose up, a volume is labelled as expected.
If a volume is created with docker-compose create, it is not labelled. It'll remain unlabelled even if you then run docker-compose up.
I've tested this in compose 1.14.0 and 1.15.0.
Minimal docker-compose.yml:
version: '3.3'
services:
  hello-world:
    image: hello-world
    volumes:
      - labelled-volume:/volume

volumes:
  labelled-volume:
    labels:
      com.test.label:
When running docker-compose up:
$ docker-compose up

Note that the creation of the volume is not mentioned in the output of docker-compose create, but the volume is created.
