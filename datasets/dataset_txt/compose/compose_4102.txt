No work for me.
A simple config:
gwm:
image: poseidon/all:latest
ports:
"5000:5000"
$ fig up
Service "%s" doesn't have any configuration options. All top level keys in your fig.yml must map to a dictionary of configuration options.
But it works if I take off "ports: - ..."
Does someone could help me?
