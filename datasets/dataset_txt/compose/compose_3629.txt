I posted a question to SO about this. But to summarize:
Attempting to start the docker service within a container run via docker-compose fails to start docker (errors below)
I run docker-compose run web /bin/bash and then at the resulting prompt I type service docker start)
Running the same container manually and then starting docker inside of that container succeeds
I get the image name from docker images and then run docker run --privileged=true -ti IMAGE_NAME /bin/bash then at the resulting prompt I type service docker start
Here's the log (/var/log/docker.log) from attempting to start docker within the container started by docker-compose:
time="2015-05-21T12:40:23Z" level=warning msg="Udev sync is not supported. This will lead to unexpected behavior, data loss and errors"
time="2015-05-21T12:40:23Z" level=error msg="There are no more loopback devices available."
time="2015-05-21T12:40:23Z" level=info msg="+job serveapi(unix:///var/run/docker.sock)"

time="2015-05-21T12:40:23Z" level=fatal msg="Shutting down daemon due to errors: error intializing graphdriver: loopback mounting failed"```
Here's the relevant docker-compose.yml:

  image: postgres
  ports:
    - "5432"

  image: redis
  ports:
    - "6379"
