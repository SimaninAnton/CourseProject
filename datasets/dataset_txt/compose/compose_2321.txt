sometimes, one want to run docker <command> <service-container> where
<command> is any valid docker command
<service-container> is the container associated with service <service>
This can be done by mentally composing the name of the container based on project and service name, but this would be useful to have a way to
either have a command giving the container name for a given service
(previous command would then become docker <command> $(docker-compose name <service>)
either have a command to relay a docker command to a service
(previous command would then become docker-compose relay <service> <command>
if this is something aleady implemented, I apologize for not having found it
If this does not exists yet, what are your feelings about such a feature?
