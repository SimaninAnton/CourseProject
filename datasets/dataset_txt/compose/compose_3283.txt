I realized if I run two docker-compose up -d processes at the same time and if the image in the yml is missing, then one proceeds and the other one immediately gets one of the following errors.
I think compose can have better retries/handling around this case.
error 1
Looks like a deserialization issue:

error 2
Most likely happens when the client pulling the image exits compose while image was being pulled, and the next requester just hangs...
