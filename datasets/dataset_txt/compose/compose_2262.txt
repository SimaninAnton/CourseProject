Scenario: I have two compose files
The base one is docker-compose.yml:
version: '2'

services:
  webapp:
    image: hello-world
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
The extended one is docker-compose.override.yml to override webapp service with build option:
version: '2'

services:

  webapp:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: webapp
    build:
      context: .
  redis:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yml
      service: redis
The command I run:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml pull
Actualy result: both hello-world and redis images are pulled
Expected result: only redis image is pulled because the hello-world image is eventually built later with docker-compose build.
