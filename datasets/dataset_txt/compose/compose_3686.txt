This may not be a bug and intentional, but it appears extends has a "Circular reference" problem when extending more than one level:
08:18:49 ~/workspaces$ cat docker-compose.yml && fig run bar bash
base:
    image: ubuntu:latest

foo:
    extends:
        file: docker-compose.yml
        service: base

bar:
    extends:
        file: docker-compose.yml
        service: foo
Circular reference:
  bar in ./docker-compose.yml
  extends bar in /Users/brianclaridge/workspaces/docker-compose.yml
08:18:56 ~/workspaces$
Curiously, fig run foo bash results in the same error. If I remove the bar service -- I can run foo again.
