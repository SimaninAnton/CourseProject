Hello, thank you for your time.
I have recently installed docker-machine on my Macbook (the non-beta, via VirtualBox), and I was interested in trying docker-compose.
I went through the Getting Started documentation, and I encountered a few snags, and wanted to share them with you.
The built container has no code.
When running docker-compose up, I had gotten the error message web_1 | python: can't open file 'app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory.
When I change the CMD in https://github.com/docker/compose/blame/ac82597ac10c9a0dbd3bf25ebde792e9cc71efc4/docs/gettingstarted.md#L70 to CMD pwd && ls -al && python app.py the output from the web container in docker-compose up becomes
web_1    | /code
web_1    | total 4
web_1    | drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   40 Apr 21 21:52 .
web_1    | drwxr-xr-x 58 root root 4096 Apr 22 00:48 ..
web_1    | python: can't open file 'app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
I am not immediately aware of how to fix this.
The redis client's hostname for redis is "redis".
See https://github.com/docker/compose/blame/ac82597ac10c9a0dbd3bf25ebde792e9cc71efc4/docs/gettingstarted.md#L40
This looks very elegant; however, I could not find the network setup to support this (versus Python blowing up when it can't resolve the name "redis"). To enable Python to connect to a Redis, I changed "redis" to localhost.
All in all, I was able to run docker run --net host redis & docker run --net host web, after building the web container as specified in the Getting Started tutorial, but that did not use docker-compose.
Thank you for your time.
