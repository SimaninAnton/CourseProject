In my docker-compose file I have specified a bunch of services, some of which are optional, i.e. which I don't need to spin up all the time.
One example is a container with Jenkins, which I use only when I need to make a change in the job config, so as to test it before editing the job on the "production" Jenkins server.
As an example, consider the following docker compose file:
version: '3'

services:

  web:
    image: nginx
    depends_on:
     - db

  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
     - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password

  jenkins:
    image: jenkins
Thanks to the depends_on, with just docker-compose up web I can have both nginx and mysql spin up.
But when I tear it down with CTRL+C, only nginx is stopped, mysql is not stopped.

dockercomposeissuestop_web_1   nginx -g daemon off;          Exit 0
Summarizing, the steps are:
docker-compose up web (no detach mode)
CTRL-C
In case this is expected, I think the behavior should be documented in here.
