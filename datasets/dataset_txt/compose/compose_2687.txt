I can't find the syntax error in my docker-compose.yml. Under services: it has (beneath others):
  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:latest
    networks:
       log:
         aliases:
           - elasticsearch
When I run docker-compose up elasticsearch I get:
ERROR: Validation failed in file './docker-compose.yml', reason(s): services.elasticsearch.networks contains an invalid type, it should be an array
Do you have any clue?
I use docker-compose version 1.7.0dev, build 77cf67b due to #271 on MacOSX
