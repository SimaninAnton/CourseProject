Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I am currently attempting to use docker + docker-compose to recreate a closed network system for testing purposes. Our external spec dictates that I need to use static IPs for several containers in the system to mimic the real thing on /24 networks so that our test scripts can use configurations consistent with the production environment.
The default behavior of the system appears to be to consume the x.x.x.1 IP of the system, which conflicts with my system specification (which assigns that to a container I am using for test purposes).
I have been unable to determine a method to change this behavior to use a different IP with the v3 syntax. These networks are internal and I don't otherwise care about the bridge adapter IP, other than it doesn't conflict with a static IP used by a container in the system.
The only workaround I have been able to find is in the v2 syntax; the gateway parameter does change the IP used by the bridge adapter.
Describe the solution you'd like
I want internal networks to be able to set which IP is used by the bridge adapter created, similar to the workaround available in v2 + gateway.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Only alternative I have been able to find is v2 syntax and abusing the 'gateway' parameter, which does change the bridge adapter IP.
