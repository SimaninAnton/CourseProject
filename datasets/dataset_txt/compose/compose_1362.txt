With the recent addition of service templates such as:
$ docker service create --name hosttempl \
                        --hostname="{{.Node.ID}}-{{.Service.Name}}"\
                         busybox top
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/#create-services-using-templates
Does docker compose support this as well? If not, are there plans to add it in? I have a few use cases where this would be really helpful. Thanks!
