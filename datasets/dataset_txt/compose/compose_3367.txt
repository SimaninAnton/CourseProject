I'm running into a problem with using pip and npm on the same container to install some packages from each. Whichever runs second causes the other's install contents in /usr/local/bin to disappear.
I've detailed this problem in a Stackoverflow post, but I haven't gotten any feedback, so I'm unsure if the problem is with my configuration or if this is a bug with either docker-compose, the official node image, or the official python image.
Here's my Dockerfile:
FROM python:3.4.3
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code
ADD ./requirements/ /code/requirements/
RUN pip install -r /code/requirements/docker.txt
ADD ./ /code/

FROM node:0.12.7
RUN npm install bower
Any thoughts on why this happens or how I can go about debugging?
