I'm not entirely sure if this should be considered a bug or a design enhancement, but here's the scenario:
You create a docker-compose.yml file in an otherwise empty directory
The contents of the file are below
You run docker-compose up -d to launch in the background
You run docker-compose scale redis=10
You receive an error message about the container name being already taken
version: '2'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    container_name: redis
Now granted, I understand that a hard-coded container name was specified in the docker-compose.yml file, but shouldn't it still append a unique container number to the end of the container_name property? I guess I'm thinking of container_name being more like container_base_name rather than a singleton value.
Any thoughts?
