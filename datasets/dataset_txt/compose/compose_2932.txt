Based in the example for environment variables is possible to override configurations based in the key:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#adding-and-overriding-configuration
# original service
environment:
  - FOO=original
  - BAR=original

# local service
environment:
  - BAR=local
  - BAZ=local

# result
environment:
  - FOO=original
  - BAR=local
  - BAZ=local
But this same approach does not work for volumes:
# original service
volumes:
  - /tmp/foo:/tmp/original
  - /tmp/bar:/tmp/original

# local service
volumes:
  - /tmp/bar:/tmp/local
  - /tmp/baz:/tmp/local

# result
volumes:
  - /tmp/foo:/tmp/original
  - /tmp/bar:/tmp/original
  - /tmp/bar:/tmp/local
  - /tmp/baz:/tmp/local
