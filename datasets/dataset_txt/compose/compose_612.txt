When docker-compose is used in a directory starting with a hyphen, I got this error ERROR: invalid reference format
This directory is managed by CI, if the name is too long CI truncates it. I tried to copy the same directory to /tmp/test and it works, that's why I am pretty sure that's it's the hyphen which causes error.
