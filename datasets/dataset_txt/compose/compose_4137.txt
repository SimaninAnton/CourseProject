hi guys,
My development fig starts a postgres db and a Play server app (jvm + scala + sbt) in development mode.
The start is successful but when the app binds the port and starts the server in the foreground, the web container exists and the environments shuts down. When I use the same "sbt run" CMD in my local environment the server keeps running in foreground until I hit CTLC-D or C.
These are my configs:
fig.yml
web:
  build: .
  command: sbt run
  links:
   - db
  ports:
   - "9000:9000"
db:
  image: postgres:9.3
Dockerfile
FROM williamyeh/scala:latest
ADD . /code
WORKDIR /code
