It seems like there is a race condition in docker-compose run when trying to pipe input into the container. For example, this sequence of shell commands can be observed:
$ echo hi | docker-compose run app cat
$ echo hi | docker-compose run app cat
hi
I.e. The first invocation does not work, but the second invocation works. This seems to be non-deterministic. A test case for reproducing is in this Gist:

This is using the following versions on OS X (not the Docker for Mac Beta):
$  docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.7.0rc1, build 1ad8866
$  docker-machine --version
docker-machine version 0.7.0-rc2, build 60dbecb
$  docker --version
Docker version 1.11.0-rc3, build eabf97a
