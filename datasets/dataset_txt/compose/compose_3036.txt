Using the configuration file below (example.yml) as an example, I'm trying to have the run command start the linked services, which should be the default behaviour.
db:
  image: redis
os:
  image: busybox
  command: /bin/sh -c 'sleep 2 && (printf "PING\r\n"; sleep 1) | nc compose_db_1 6379'
Compose works as expected with the up command, as shown below.
Command:
$ docker-compose --x-networking -p compose -f example.yml up
Output:
...
db_1 | 1:M 30 Nov 18:59:13.498 * The server is now ready to accept connections on port 6379
os_1 | +PONG
compose_os_1 exited with code 0
...
Now, using the run command, it doesn't work as expected.
Command:
docker-compose --x-networking -p compose -f example.yml \
  run --rm os /bin/sh -c 'sleep 2 && (printf "PING\r\n"; sleep 1) | nc compose_db_1 6379'
Output:
nc: bad address 'compose_db_1'
The db service is never started, therefore os cannot find it. Am I missing anything?
Thanks!
