I have a number of projects which are using docker-compose and I'm starting to have the need to specify the project name directly into the docker-compose.yml
Consider this scenario:
I have two projects with the following directory structures
project1
|-- docker
|    |-- docker-compose.yml
|-- public
|    |--index.php
|-- vendor
|-- modules
project2
|-- docker
|    |-- docker-compose.yml
|-- public
|    |--index.php
|-- vendor
|-- modules
And with two docker-compose.yml like this:
web:
  image: fntlnz/nginx:1.6.2
  volumes:
    - ../:/var/www/project
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.2:80:80"
  links:
    - fpm:fpm

fpm:
  image: fntlnz/php-fpm:5.6.6
  volumes:
    - ../:/var/www/project
  links:
    - redis:redis

redis:
  image: redis
When I issue a docker-compose up in the project1 directory it will start three containers with the following names docker_web_1, docker_fpm_1, docker_redis_1.
If now I issue the same command in the project2 directory it recreates the same containers of project1 instead creating it's own.
I know that I can change the project name using the -p option or the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable but IMHO would be useful to have in the docker-compose.yml something like project_name: project1.
My docker-compose.yml would become:
project_name: project1
web:
  image: fntlnz/nginx:1.6.2
  volumes:
    - ../:/var/www/project
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.2:80:80"
  links:
    - fpm:fpm

fpm:
  image: fntlnz/php-fpm:5.6.6
  volumes:
    - ../:/var/www/project
  links:
    - redis:redis

redis:
  image: redis
