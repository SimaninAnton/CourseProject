When there is no docker-compose.yml then there is this nice error message:
$ docker-compose up

        Can't find a suitable configuration file in this directory or any parent. Are you in the right directory?

        Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, fig.yml, fig.yaml
Yet if one exists but is empty it produces this output:
$ docker-compose up

This is very hard to debug and was already mentioned in #129 yet this still persists in docker-compose 1.4.2.
