I am getting this error every now and then when I run docker-compose up -d with a big (>1 GB) image, such as hansenms/gadgetron_no_cuda (1.2 GB). The error line reads as:
requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None):
  Read timed out. (read timeout=60)
I know that there is a --timeout=10 argument to docker-compose up but that defaults to 10 seconds (the error msg above says 60) and this argument reference says:
“Use this timeout in seconds for container shutdown **when attached or when containers are already running.”
So I guess that's not going to fix this... Is there another way I can extend the timeout for the request made to the docker engine to pull the image down from registry?
