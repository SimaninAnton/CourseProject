As shown on in the official doc: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#args you can pass arguments from docker-compose to the build process.
But, the Dockerfile must start with directive FROM, and an argument is available only after calling ARG your-arg-name.
So one cannot provide base version through build argument.
Could it be possible to make this working? So we can call something like this: FROM ubuntu:$UBUNTU_VERSION?
