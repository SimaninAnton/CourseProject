There seems to be an issue with tmpfs or /dev/shm when re-creating containers.
I have the following in the docker-compose.yml file:
version: '3.1'
services:
  ...
    tmpfs: /dev/shm:exec,size=1g
    volumes:
      - /dev/shm
When I initially bring this up with docker-compose up it works fine. If I stop it and try to bring it up while also rebuilding the images I get:
> docker-compose up --build
Building ...
