Hey everyone, I'm making a simple test environment using docker-compose for a project in my company. However, I have built a simple docker-compose.yml file like so :
version: '3'
services:
  entry:
    image: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  maids:
    image: "local_tests/maids3"
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
The idea is that entry connects to maids that stores an ML algorithm's results in a redis cache.
I am using
% docker -v                                                             
Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build cec0b72
% docker-compose -v                                                            
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
However, when I do docker-compose up, I get
% docker-compose up                                                                
Creating pocbasket_entry_1 ... 
Creating pocbasket_redis_1 ... 
Creating pocbasket_maids_1 ... 
Creating pocbasket_maids_1
Creating pocbasket_redis_1

Creating pocbasket_redis_1 ... done

ERROR: for entry  list indices must be integers, not unicode

Any clue how I can fix this ? Thanks in advance !
