Currently i'm using docker compose to connect my web app with the postgre database. My config looks like this:
# Dockerfile

FROM rails:onbuild
RUN rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
# config/database.yml

# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
#
default: &default
    adapter: postgresql
    encoding: utf8
    database: rezeptr_prod
    pool: 5
    username: postgres
    password:
    host: db

development:
  <<: *default
  database: rezeptr_dev

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: rezeptr_test
# docker-compose.yml

db:
  image: postgres
web:
  build: .
  volumes:
    - .:/usr/src/app
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  links:
    - db:db
If i run docker-compose up i get this error
could not translate host name "db" to address: Name or service not known
If i don't run rake db:create ... in the Dockerfile and run it like this docker-compose run web rake db:create it works fine and i don't get any errors. Can you help me?
