This StackOverflow post describes my issue well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31210197/how-to-make-environmental-variables-available-to-docker-run-commands-from-docker
I'm trying to set environment variables within docker-compose.yml via the "env_file" directive.
I've got my environment variables (such as http_proxy, etc.) but those variables aren't available until after the Docker container is built.
Ideally, those environment variables would be set before the Docker container starts to build, so commands such as "RUN apt-get install package" would have access to them (and be affected by them, as is the case with http_proxy)
I think this is a reasonable request, but is it even possible to implement with the way docker-compose is written?
