docker compose already allows for overriding Dockerfile CMD. It would also be nice if there was the ability to override the Dockerfile WORKDIR as well.
For example:
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    build: .
    workdir: /newworkdir
    command: echo "hello"
I believe this is possible because docker run takes --workdir as an option. I didn't see this as an option in the current version of the docker compose documentation.
