I am running currently 1.6rc. I'm happy with the added build and image feature. But to be honest
its not of much because it doesn't fulfill the complete workflow with swarm.
You can't push the images and therefore running them after building fails in a docker-swarm scenario. (they simply can't find the image) allowing a push would work.
You have no control over on which server the images get build (i.e. one server can have much more ram for building than others).
Is there anywhere a roadmap i can see?
