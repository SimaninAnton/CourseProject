Recently there was a discrepancy between the version of docker-py specified in setup.py install_requires and the version specified in requirements.txt. This was fixed by manually updating at least one of the files. Perhaps it would be better to directly read requirements.txt in setup.py and use those as the install_requires values? This would mean one less place to update when bumping a dependency in the future, a task that I am sure some developers will forget to do, or forget to check for during code review.....
