My environment:
$ docker -v
Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7

$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version: 1.5.0dev
I've created a test repo to reproduce this issue.
When using links for connecting a sample web app to a fluentd container, and using the fluentd-address to refer to this link, I am getting the following error:
sample_fluentd_compose nritholtz$ docker-compose up
Creating samplefluentdcompose_log_1
Creating samplefluentdcompose_web_1
Cannot start container ca26fe06dd7e4d63b401b12203f5670a8b95fa0c50793fb4ab5e1ec052c4cd30: Failed to initialize logging driver: dial tcp 198.105.244.74:24224: i/o timeout
However, when exposing the fluentd container port to host and then connecting via localhost, it works just fine.
