I'm having an issue launching a compose based stack. Using docker stack deploy... I'm starting a stack running on docker swarm in AWS. When executing docker stack ps <name> I see multiple attempts to launch each service with each failing to find the image. This happens for a few minutes until the services start working at random. The image comes from a private repo hosted on docker hub and I'm using --with-registry-auth to start the service. The same thing happens when updating a service via docker service update ... - it fails and retries for 1-2 minutes then it starts working randomly.
