When running
docker-compose up
and subsequently restarting one of the services (well after it is fully up) there seems to be an exception that causes the thread monitoring events to die. What I see in the original log stream is
bms_bms_1 exited with code 137
bms_bms_1 exited with code 137
Exception in thread Thread-9:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner
  File "threading.py", line 763, in run
  File "compose/cli/log_printer.py", line 197, in watch_events

  File "json/decoder.py", line 369, in decode
ValueError: Extra data: line 2 column 1 - line 2 column 616 (char 612 - 1227)
Since it's easy for me to reproduce I can do some debugging to try to provide some more detail.
