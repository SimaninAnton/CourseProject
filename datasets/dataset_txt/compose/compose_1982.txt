Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?

I have declared a service with mode global and with a constraint to run it only in two servers (my cluster runs in 3 servers). When I try to update as following:
sudo docker service update --image $IMAGE:$TAG $SERVICE
The service is not updated.
If I do it with in "replicas" mode it works perfectly.
Thank you in advance.
