I dont know if this is the proper place for posting this. I apologize if it isn't.
When running:
i get the following error:
C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe Error parsing reference "Files/Docker" is not a valid repository/tag.
What am i doing wrong?
Btw, Kitematic isnt supported right?.
Thanks.
