Like with git, I would like to be able to run docker-compose from within a subdirectory so I don't need to repeatedly change directories when working on a project.
Current behaviour:
$ cd myproject
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating myproject_abc_1...
Creating myproject_xyz_1...
$ cd another/directory
$ docker-compose logs xyz
Can't find a suitable configuration file. Are you in the right directory?

Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, fig.yml, fig.yaml
docker-compose could simply look in all ancestor directories for the .yml/.yaml files until it finds one, change working directory, and continue as normal.
