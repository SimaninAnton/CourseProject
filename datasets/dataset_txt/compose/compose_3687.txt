I use docker under Debian Wheezy.
My Debian is up to date and I don't know why I don't have docker-compose available.
uname -a :
Linux hypvm2 3.16.0-0.bpo.4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt4-3~bpo70+1 (2015-02-12) x86_64 GNU/Linux
docker --version :
Docker version 1.6.0, build 4749651
Thanks in advance
