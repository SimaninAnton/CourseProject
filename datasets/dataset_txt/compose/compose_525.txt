I am on Docker For Mac 8.03.1-ce-mac65 (24312)
Description of the issue
I am reopening this issue #253 as the problem is still occuring for me and from the looks of comments on that issue, several other people too.
Original description:
If I start a bash shell inside a docker container, then start typing a long command at the bash prompt, I get to maybe 50-60 characters across the window, then the line wraps back on itself and I'm then typing over the top of what I've already written. It doesn't affect the input, only the rendering of the shell.
There is a workaround described in the linked issue but it kinda sucks to have to do that all the time
