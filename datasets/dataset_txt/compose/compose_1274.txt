I have a service call HealthCheck to verify database connection.
I use docker-compose up (with docker-compose.yml housing all environments variables) vs docker run (I must manually pass env variables in the command) to bring up the docker container but there is an observation:
If I hit this call
http://my-ip:8081/api/v1/HealthCheck
Service brought by docker-compose up: it takes around 2257 ms to return very call
while another with docker run: it takes < 1 second to give me the result
Docker-compose version: 1.8
Docker-engine version: 1.12.3
The time to start container seems similar in both ways
Any ideas why there is the slowness with docker-compose?
