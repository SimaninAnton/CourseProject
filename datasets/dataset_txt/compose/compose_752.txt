The cache_from option, mapping to docker build --cache-from <image>, was introduced into Compose version 1.12 or 1.17, depending on which release note is correct, but only in the Compose file format 3.x.
Folks are still using 2.x and expect this version to be maintained with respect to Docker updates!
