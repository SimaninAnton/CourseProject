run.sh contains some unnecessary statements that can be removed. For instance, a statement like
if [ -n "$foo" ]; then
echo bar
fi
adds an extra check for the [ result that was already evaluated, and shell script best practice is then to write
[ -z "$foo" ] || echo bar
instead and save us from wasting some extra CPU cycles while decreasing the shell script footprint too.
Furthermore, there is no need to add quotes where not needed, and also not make external calls to external binaries like dirname (where the shell build-in string manipulation can do the job for us at a much lower cost).
I will add a pull request for this.
