Have added es service in docker-compose. No error during build time but got run error "error: sysctl vm.max_map_count is not in a separate kernel namespace". My docker version is 1.12.6 bundled with RancherOS and docker-compose is 1.11.1. I also tried array format but same error.
ES service setting in docker-compose.yml
es:
build:
