Hello, I can still reproduce the issue: #4761
When I have this appended to a service:
    shm_size: 1G
    tmpfs: /dev/shm:rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=1G
Docker-compose syntax version: 2
When I scale up the container, then an error appears.
At least two different Linux setups are affected.
On other twos it does not appear.
One of problematic setup: docker-compose version 1.17.0, build ac53b73, Ubuntu 16.04
Thanks for your time.
