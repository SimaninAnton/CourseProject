When I first run a fig with a volume mounted, it usually fails because of SELinux context.
The fix is to run this:
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t ./something
Would be nice to have that automated in fig.yml, to ensure SELinux never disturbs development:
app:
    build: .
    volumes:
        - ./something:/mountpoint
        - other:/other:ro
    chcon:
        - ./something: svirt_sandbox_file_t
