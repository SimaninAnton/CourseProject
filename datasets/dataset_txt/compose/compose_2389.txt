Hi,
Versions:
docker-compose version 1.5.2, build 7240ff3
Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5
I have a docker-compose file that starts up nginx after mounting nginx.conf.
Suppose this is original-docker-compose.yml:
nginx:
  image: <custom nginx image>
  net: "host"
  ports:
    - "80"
  volumes:
     - ./nginx.conf:/opt/openresty/nginx/conf/custom/nginx.conf
The nginx config needs to be overriden in certain cases:
docker-compose -f original-docker-compose.yml -f overriding-docker-compose.yml up -d
overriding-docker-compose.yml file:
nginx:
  volumes:
    - ./environment-specific.conf:/opt/openresty/nginx/conf/custom/nginx.conf
When running docker-compose up with this override, nginx crashes immediately because what gets mounted is somehow an empty directory instead of the file `environment-specific.conf'.
nginx: [crit] pread() "/opt/openresty/nginx/conf/custom/nginx.conf" failed (21: Is a directory)
tail: cannot open '/opt/openresty/nginx/logs/access.log' for reading: No such file or directory
tail: no files remaining
This looks like a bug, but I could be missing something. Any help / insight / workaround is appreciated.
Thanks.
