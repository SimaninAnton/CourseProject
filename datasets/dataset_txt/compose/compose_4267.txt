Just read the official announcement that Orchard's founders @bfirsh and @aanand are joining Docker to work on the orchestration part of the Docker ecosystem.
I am very excited to see this announcement and wanted to congratulate you on this. Hoping to see even better orchestration with less 'hacking' around missing features upstream.
Great news!
