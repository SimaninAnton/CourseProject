Please, look at this config:
mynode:
    image: myimage
    environment:
        - "affinity:container!=myproject_mynode_*"
    ports:
        - "50010:50010"
Once I try to scale it with docker-compose scale mynode=3 it rejects to scale with the following error:
Service "mynode" cannot be scaled because it specifies a port on the host. If multiple containers for this service were created, the port would clash.
Remove the ":" from the port definition in docker-compose.yml so Docker can choose a random port for each container.
However, the ports won't clash because of the affinity.
Now, I'm forced to use net: host to avoid this.
