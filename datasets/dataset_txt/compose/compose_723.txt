Description of the issue
During docker upgrade with live-restore enabled (over daemon.json file), containers started with docker-compose are stopping. Not sure if that is supposed to be like that and it is docker-compose limitations?
When I start containers with docker run command on the same host with the same version of docker, upgrade doesn't impact running containers.
the same issue as #5865 on newer version of docker engine and compose.
Context information (for bug reports)
We start docker containers with docker compose yml file.
