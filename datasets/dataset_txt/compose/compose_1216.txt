docker-compose config prints out a configuration that docker-compose considers invalid. This happens starting with version: "2.1" and regards volume configurations.
This issue appears to originate from name being allowed directly under volume but does not get along with external. According to documentation name started being allowed under the volume with 2.1. Having name directly under the volume will auto-create it. Having it under external complains and it must be manually made. However according to documentation (and testing) name is not allowed directly under the volume in 3.x.
This issue escalates all the way through version 2.1 -> 3.3.
