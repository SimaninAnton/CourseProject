I'm trying to use the new Compose long syntax ports
version: '3.2'
...
    ports:
      - target: 50020
        published: 50020
        protocol: tcp
        mode: host
      - target: 50010
        published: 50010
        protocol: tcp
        mode: host
...
Getting following error on docker-compose build
ERROR: Version in "./docker-compose.yml" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version ("2.0", "2.1", "3.0", "3.1") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
