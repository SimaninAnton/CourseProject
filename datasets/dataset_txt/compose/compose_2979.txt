We have an application template with docker-compose.override.yml files.
If a user with docker-compose < 1.5.0 tries to start it, it breaks.
The stack basically starts, but volumes settings for local development are missing and the user gets unrelated errors, see phundament/app#191 for an example.
This may be also very useful for all the new features like networking and volumes, which are also planned for compose.
