When I start my 30+ containers on my laptop, they all compete with each other for resources. I don't care what order they start (I'm not asking to be able to control startup ordering, or delay until dependencies are healthy); I just don't want them to all start at once.
Would you consider adding an option to the scale command that would make it ramp up gradually, rather than start all containers at once?
