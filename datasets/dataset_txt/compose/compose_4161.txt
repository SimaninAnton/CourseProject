What's the best practice on cloning private repos (e.g. gems or npm modules)? Currently, I'd need to add my private ssh keys into the repo via volumes in fig.yml. Is there a better way?
I'd think the optimal way of handling this would be to forward the ssh agent. Perhaps have an option in the fig.yml for doing that?
