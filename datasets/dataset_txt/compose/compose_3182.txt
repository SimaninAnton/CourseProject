We have an machine that's having an issue where host volumes aren't being mounted inside of the container on docker-compose up. We're running Arch x86_64 with Linux 4.2.3, Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7-dirty, and docker-compose version: 1.4.2. Here's our config:
docker-compose.yml
db:
  image: postgres:9.4
wsgi:
  build: app
  links:
    - db
  environment:
    LM_PROD:
  restart: always
web:
  build: web
  links:
    - wsgi
  ports:
   - "80:80"
   - "443:443"
  volumes_from:
    - wsgi
  restart: always
dev:
  build: app
  links:
    - db
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  volumes:
    - ./app/:/mnt/app/
  environment:
    LM_DEBUG: "true"
    LM_PROD:
  restart: always
While wsgi service works just fine (which uses the same ./app directory), the dev service doesn't. Even stranger, it seems that we're able to get host volumes mounted inside the container just fine with a shell command that does the same thing.
docker build -t dev app
db_link="$(docker run -d  postgres:9.4)"
docker run \
  --restart=always \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --link "$db_link:db" \
  -e "LM_DEBUG=true" \
  -e "LM_PROD=$LM_PROD" \
  -v "$(pwd)/app/:/mnt/app/" \
  dev
Weird, right? Here are our logs, showing that the file ./app/util/start isn't being mounted to /mnt/app/util/start, whereas it's definitely there when we build the directory (as opposed to mounting a host volume).
$ docker-compose up
