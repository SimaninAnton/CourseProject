Hi guys,
I'm using docker run security-opt "credentialspec... without any issues but when I try to use it in docker-compose yaml file, I get the following warning: WARNING: Some services (wcm) use the 'credential_spec' key, which will be ignored. Compose does not support 'credential_spec' configuration - use docker stack deploy to deploy to a swarm.
Did I miss something in the documentation?
