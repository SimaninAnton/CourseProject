Description of the issue
If you have a typo like an extra space, in the docker compose file version field, you'll see a stack trace rather than error message.

version: '3 '

services:
  web:
    image: alpine:latest
(Note the space following the 3)
Run compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml config
Observed result
Stack trace is printed:

Expected result
Helpful message like:
The `version` field in the file `docker-compose.yml` contains an unexpected character. It should be either 1, 2, or 3. We found: "3 ".
