I have a working docker-compose example running a static html with nginx.
The directory tree:
├── docker-compose.yml
├── nginx
│   ├── app
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── Dockerfile
The docker-compose.yml:
nginx:
  build: ./nginx
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/app:/usr/share/nginx/html
  ports:
    - 8080:80
The nginx directory has the Dockerfile:
FROM nginx
Everything is working right.
The problem is that I build a Docker-Swarm infrastructure with docker-machine following the Docker documentation: The Local, the swarm-master and two nodes.
Everything seems to work fine too.
$ eval $(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)
$[swarm-master]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                  NAMES
d8afafeb9f05        few_nginx           "nginx -g 'daemon off"   20 minutes ago      Up 3 seconds        443/tcp, 192.168.99.102:8080->80/tcp   swarm-host-00/few_nginx_1
But nginx is returning a Forbidden
$[swarm-master]$ curl http://192.168.99.102:8080/
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.9.10</center>
</body>
</html>
I enter into the virtualbox and into the container:
$[swarm-master]$ docker-machine ssh swarm-host-00
docker@swarm-host-00:~$ docker exec -ti d8afafeb9f05 bash
and nothing inside the nginx/html directory:
root@d8afafeb9f05:/# ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
Version:
$[swarm-master]$ docker version

Is it necessary to do something different in compose/swarm for the volumes? Am I doing something wrong?
