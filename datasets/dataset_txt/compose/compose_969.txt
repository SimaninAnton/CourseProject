https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#long-syntax
Before anybody says that the long-syntax only works with 3.2, the documentation also clearly states:
Added in version 2.3 file format.
I am using the 2.3 file format because I need to control the resource usage without deploying via Swarm (which is not possible with 3.x).
This example does not work with Compose 2.3:
version: "2.3"
services:
web:
image: nginx:alpine
ports:
- "80:80"
volumes:
- type: volume
source: mydata
target: /data
The following error is returned
services.web.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be a string
If the long syntax does not work with 2.3, the documentation should be updated to reflect this.
