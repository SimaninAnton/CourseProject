Hi guys !
When doing a docker-compose -f /a/b/c/docker-compose.yml pull from /a -> it works.
When doing a docker-compose -f /a/b/c/docker-compose.yml pull from /a/foo/bar -> it does not work:
ERROR: .IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/a/b/c/docker-compose.yml'
Didn't investigate more on this problem.
