Hello.
I have service A containing "/path/to/file.socket".
This file shall now be in service B in the path "/different/path/to/socket.io" (could also be the same path, tho).
It would be very useful to have such an option in the docker-compose.yml file:
version: '2'
services:
    MYSQL_SERVICE:
        image: mysql:latest
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ''
            MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: 1
    PHP_SERVICE:
        image: php:latest
        volumes_from:
            - MYSQL_SERVICE:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Currently you might need to create an empty file, mount it in service A and then mount the same file in service B. Such a detour. Especially if you need to do it with directories - then it will end up in a big mess.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Cheers!
