As this moby/moby#15182 functionality has been merged, it would be great to manage with Compose
I.e.:
Dockerfile with default variables
ARG vhost=default.com
RUN echo $vhost > ...
Overriding through docker-composer.yml
web:
  build: ...
  arguments:
    - vhost: dev.com
Or an hierarchy of extended environments
production:
  extends: web
  arguments:
    - vhost: my-final-domain.com
