We've just merged the docs for using compose in a container, but the script currently points at dnephin/docker-compose. We should move the image to something like dockercompose/compose (to match dockerswarm/). Or we could make it an "official" image and just call it "compose".
We also need to update our release process docs to bump the version in this script and publish the new image.
