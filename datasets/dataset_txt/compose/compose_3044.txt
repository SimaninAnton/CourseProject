Im trying to launch compose on win 10 without any luck.
docker-compose version: 1.5.1
Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5 ( all installed via docker-toolbox )
First error is following. I have set following env vars: DOCKER_CERT_PATH='C:\Users\ShapeR.docker\machine\machines\default' ( which is a valid path and keys are there ca.pem, cert.pem, key.pem ).
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
When i try to launch docker-compose up i get following error:
C:\Dev\PycharmProjects\django-rentapplication>docker-compose up

docker-compose returned -1
Seems like it doesnt find a keys where they are. Also paths in stacktrace are non existent. ( like C:\projects\compose\ - there is no such folder on my pc)
I looked into sources of compose and figured out if i take out DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY it should run fine. I did it. And get a new error.

docker.errors.DockerException: Invalid bind address protocol: "tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
Which is totally mystery for me, since in utils.py that i find on my disk parse_host is on different line and dont see how it can not strip tcp:// which it should..
But then again i found if i strip tcp:// from addres it should work again.
But again no luck. New error.

docker.errors.DockerException: ('Invalid port: %s', '"192.168.99.100:2376"')
docker-compose returned -1
And at this point i totally lost since don't see how this could happen becvause from sources that i look into its not possible ( well like any previous errors too..) and neither i see how to solve this.
