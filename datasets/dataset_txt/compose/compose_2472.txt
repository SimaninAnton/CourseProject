We've been happily using docker compose for a couple of months in our project (~9 service, moderately complex setup). From time to time, usually when a new team member tries to set up the development environment, there's an issue with bringing up the environment. When this happens, all we get is some cryptic error message:
No such file or directory
Container command not found or does not exist.
At this point, we usually have to dig into the person's machine and check what's wrong. We usually have to: check container logs, check images, inspect containers, try to start them manually using docker directly. From time to time, we even have to check docker logs, start stuff with strace...
It would be so much better if compose printed way more information when an error occurs: service name, engine API call, all arguments... Ideally, engine would do the same by sending more detailed error messages.
