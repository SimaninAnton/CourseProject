Hi there
We use macvlan as a 2nd network in a docker container to connect it to the physical network.
Mostly it works fine, but approximately every 8th "docker-compose up" command fails with this message:
(...)
Creating default_orion_1
Creating default_pegasus_1

ERROR: for broho  Cannot start service broho: driver failed revoking external connectivity on endpoint default_broho_1 (4aed7b1bb508a07d3daf074901d011778a153460c1c87a238f2f4d4c08a7519d): network not found: 1e320a2ba090ea6f6b563c421ecc3eda121aa3065cd32c52dc74fb42851d23d6
Encountered errors while bringing up the project.

Is there something I can test to help debugging?
When I remove 'networks' in the service 'broho', and connect this container by "docker network connect isa-vehicle default_broho_1" after compose started the container, it works fine.
