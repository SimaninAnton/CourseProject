This is only supported in "swarm" mode and not in "compose" per instructions and error message. Why is it not supported in "compose"?
PS C:\Users\Desktop\interdocker> docker-compose down
WARNING: Some services (iis, sql) use the 'credential_spec' key, which will be ignored. Compose does not support 'credential_spec' configuration - use `docker stack deploy` to deploy to a swarm.
