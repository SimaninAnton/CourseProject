I created a shell script to detect the minimum version of docker-compose.
I noticed that in 1.5.1 it looks like
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version: 1.5.1
while in 1.5.2...
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.5.2, build 7240ff3
Which leads to a regex like
if [[ $(docker-compose --version) =~ version[:]?\ (.*)[,]? ]]; then
Is this platform dependent? Will the string format stay like in 1.5.2 future versions?
