I can't reproduce it but I would say about 10% of the time when I hit CTRL+C, the containers that were started with docker-compose up fail to stop. I'll get an ABORT message in the terminal but they are still up. When it works, it says "gracefully stopping..." instead of ABORT.
At this point I need to docker-compose stop them to "really" stop them.
It was much worse in earlier versions of Compose but it's still happening often enough that I feel like it needs some attention. If you need more info let me know.

Potentially relevant information
When I encounter the issue I'm always running multiple containers, such as postgres, redis, and multiple web services. I never run 1 container so I can't say for sure if it would happen with only 1.
It happens with and without using links and both the legacy and v2 docker-compose.yml files.
