Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
docker-compose up --exit-code-from test will return exit code 0 if another service ends before the tests finish (even if that other container exits with non-zero exit code).
Describe the solution you'd like
any kind of flag or combination of flags that would make sure that a docker-compose exit code 0 would mean: the test service really ran until it cleanly exited with code 0
So either change --exit-code-from behavior to return non-zero exit code if the test service exit prematurely, either create a new flag that could have this behavior.
Describe alternatives you've considered
I have created a bash script to force this behavior; but it uses grep, so not the best solution:

Additional context
I asked a question on stackoverflow without much response, I have seen similar questions on the web. Nobody seems to have a solution for this.
