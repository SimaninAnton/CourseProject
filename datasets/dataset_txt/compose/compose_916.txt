By mistake, I had two volume sections in one (big) service definition, e.g.
services:
   test:
        volumes:
           - ./test1:/test1
        environment:
           - testenv=abc
        volumes:
           - ./test2:/test2
It took me some time to find this bug because compose didn't act as expected.
Current behavior:
Compose used only the last volumes section. All other volumes sections were silently ignored
Expected behavior: One of
Throw an error: Invalid syntax
Use all volumes sections
Probably this can be generalized to other sections than "volumes".
Probably this is just expected behavior because of yml syntax (overwriting), but from developer point of view it should be fixed. In big / complex compose files this isn't always obviously.
