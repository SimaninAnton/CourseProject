Trying to perform docker-compose build in a directory with a path containing non-ascii characters (Russian letters), got this:
Traceback (most recent call last):

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 17-22: ordinal not in range(128)
Doing the same in a directory without non-ascii characters in a path seems to be OK.
