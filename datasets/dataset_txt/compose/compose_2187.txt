I was just going through the quickstart guide and discovered that the example Dockerfile threw errors.
line 30 of rails.md
I had to change line 30 to cd /myapp && bundle install
And then I had more errors.
I am happy to make a pull request. I wanted to file this before I lost track of it whilst doing the tutorial.
This analogous Dockerfile example fixed the issue:
FROM ruby:2.3.0

VOLUME ["/widget_app"]
WORKDIR /widget_app
EXPOSE 3000

RUN apt-get update -qq &&\
    apt-get install -y \
        build-essential \
        libpq-dev \
        nodejs
ADD ./widget_app/Gemfile /widget_app/Gemfile
ADD ./widget_app/Gemfile.lock /widget_app/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
  web:
    build: .
    command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'
    volumes:
      - ./widget_app:/widget_app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
