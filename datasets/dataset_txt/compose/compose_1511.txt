Suddenly, docker-compose became terrifically slow. I'm eager to find out why.
Simple docker-compose ps when there are no running containers takes 10 seconds:
$ time docker-compose ps
Name   Command   State   Ports
------------------------------

real 0m10.320s
user 0m0.232s
sys 0m0.061s
while docker's ps takes 0.02 seconds:
$ time docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

real 0m0.019s
user 0m0.008s
sys 0m0.006s
Getting up this docker-compose.yml (with image already pulled in)
version: "3"
services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["echo", "hello"]
takes more then 1 minute 16 seconds:
$ time docker-compose up -d
Creating network "test_default" with the default driver
Creating test_ubuntu_1

real 1m16.356s
user 0m0.459s
sys 0m0.112s
(I'm not sure why I don't see 'hello' output here, tell me if you know)
while docker does the same in less then a second:
$ time docker run ubuntu echo hello
hello

real 0m0.794s
user 0m0.011s
sys 0m0.010s
I'm running docker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e and docker-compose version 1.11.2, build dfed245 on macOS 10.12.4.
