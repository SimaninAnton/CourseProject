For some reason I have a leftover ghost network. At some point I created via docker-compose but I cannot get rid of it. Is there a location I can remove it from a file? As of now I can't bring down my compose without stopping all of the containers individually and manually removing the network.
$ docker-compose down --remove_orphans
Removing network xxx_default
WARNING: Network xxx_default not found.

$ docker inspect xxx_default

$ docker network rm xxx_default
Error response from daemon: No such network: xxx_default

$ docker network ls

docker prune will run but not remove it either
I have a feeling the docker-compose --project-name flag might be a culprit here?
