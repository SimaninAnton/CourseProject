I have a two cronjob for run php service in same time.
Only one run command execute correctly
Cannot create container for service php: Conflict. The container name "/folder_php_run_1" is already in use by container {hashhere}. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
Command exited with non-zero status 1
