docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
I can't get stop_signal to work.
version: '2'
services:
  some_name:
    image: node:4.4-onbuild
    command: some_command
    stop_signal: SIGINT
It seems stop_signal is just ignored and I need to wait timeout (10 seconds) for SIGKILL to be sent and container terminated.
I think stop_signal was introduced in 1.6? #2508.
