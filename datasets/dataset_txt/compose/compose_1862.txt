Trying to test out some systems with docker.
system:
    mac_address: 11:11:12:34:5a:bc
I need the first few characters of the mac address to always be 1111 (another container searches the network and looks for devices starting with these values).
I'd like to do docker-compose scale system=5, but when I do it, all 5 will have the same mac address. Is there some way to get the mac address dynamic? I don't care if I need to hack my way around it.
One idea I had was to write a bash script that would run something like
export MAC_ADDR=11:11:<random value>
docker-compose scale=2
export MAC_ADDR=11:11:<random value>
docker-compose scale=3
... etc
But wasn't sure if there was some other mechanism?
