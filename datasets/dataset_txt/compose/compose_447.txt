Description of the issue
network flag for the build option of a service in Docker Compose yml file, doesn't work when using the name of the network. It only does when prefixing the network name with the project name (<project name>_<network name>). I don't think it is an expected behavior.
Error:
Service servicename failed to build: network networkname not found.
Output of "docker-compose config":
networks: 
  "networkname": 
    driver: bridge 

services:
    "servicename": 
        build:
            context: ../
            dockerfile: ./dockerfile
            network: # add network for build runtime (dockerfile RUN commands).
                "networkname" # ISSUE - docker doesn't resolve the project name, it should be specified explicitly. i.e. `<networkname>` -> `<projectName>_<networkName>`
Steps to reproduce the issue
Create yml file with network flag for the build, using the name of the network only.
Run docker-compose --project-name <project name> build <service name>
Error - network not found
Observed result
Usage of <project name>_<network name> fixes the issue. But requires knowledge of the project name before hand, not so dynamic for usage on different project names (e.g. with the compose --project-name flag).
Expected result
Use name of network only (without specifying project name explicitly) to attach the container to it on build runtime.
