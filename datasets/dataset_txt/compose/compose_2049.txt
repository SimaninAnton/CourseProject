Is there a way for an application with a docker-compose.yml to depend on another application with docker-compose.yml?
For instance, let's pretend I have an API in one repo and a UI in another repo. And both have a docker-compose.yml file and each has it's own set of containers that are required.
Can the UI have some sort of directive that will tell it to load the API and all of it's containers?
