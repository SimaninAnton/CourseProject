I have a problem to use environment variables in docker-compose in windows, I need to pass the tag of the image that will be used.
how to pass the tag to the docker-compose?
I also need it to work on windows and linux
I have a Makefile:
tag = 1.0.1
apixx-up:
     docker build ./src -t apicredito:$(tag)
     docker-compose -p apixx -f production.yml up -d
docker-composel file (production.yml):
version: '3'
services:
   app:
     image: "apixx:${TAG}"
     container_name: apixx
     volumes:
       - ../src:/src
     expose
       - "8000"
