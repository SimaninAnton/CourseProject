We are attempting to use fig with images specified as private repositories hosted on quay.io, but, when running fig up, it reports a 403 Unauthorized even though we ran docker login quay.io beforehand.
Running docker pull quay.io/foo/bar works as expected.
Example fig.yml:
---
recommendations:
  build .
  links:
    - redis:redis
    - memcached:memcached
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
  environment:
    RAILS_ENV: demo
    RACK_ENV: demo
redis:
  image: quay.io/modcloth/redis:latest
  ports:
    - 6379:6379
memcached:
  image: quay.io/modcloth/memcached:latest
  environment:
    MEMCACHED_INTERFACE: 0.0.0.0
  ports:
    - 11211:11211
