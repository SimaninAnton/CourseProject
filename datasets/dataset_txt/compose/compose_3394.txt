Hi, i'm trying to use docker-compose logs in a git hook script but got no log lines. After some fiddling i figured out that the output seems to be buffered. If i run python with -u or PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 it works fine.
How to reproduce:
docker-compose logs | cat
This works:
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 docker-compose logs | cat
Not really sure how it should behave. Maybe configure line buffering for stdout somehow when not a tty?
