I am attempting to setup a Django project I made in eclipse in Docker-Compose for deployment purposes.
I copied my project into a directory just for Docker and followed a variety of tutorials online and from my understanding, the only services my App requires in Docker are Django and Postgres. Here is my docker-compose.yml file:
db:
  image: postgres:latest
  ports:
    - "5432"
  environment:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    POSTGRES_USER: postgres
web:
  build: .
  ports:
   - "8000:8000"
  volumes:
   - .:/code
  links:
   - db
  command: python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
and my DockerFile:
FROM python:3

#ENV LANG C.UTF-8
#RUN export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"

RUN mkdir /code

WORKDIR /code

#Add requirements.txt to code
ADD requirements.txt /code/

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

ADD . /code/
I have tested the python command locally in my virtualenv and the server starts, however, when I run 'docker-compose up' in the folder the application is located in, I get this output:

No message about the server starting or anything like that, I thunk its compiling my code due to the warning messages about deprecation I get when I run the application locally but I am quite stumped here. Can anyone see my error?
Upon closer inspection and changing the port for the Django server, I find that accessing the webpage returns a "Connection to the Server was reset while the page was loading" error. This indicates that something is being set up on that page. But I still cannot access it. I know Docker-Compose is working as simple Django applications from tutorials work just fine.
