Running docker-compose build --no-cache will fail if one of the Dockerfile commands returns a non-zero exit code. However running docker build --no-cache will return successfully in the same condition.
Example:
Dockerfile has command RUN npm install libxmljs:
npm will return code 137 (a warning) from this command
docker-compose will exit at this stage while docker does not.
I can provide more details of the builds if necessary.
