Description of the issue
I am under the impression, from looking at various examples of docker-compose.yml files, that I should be able to map a file directly using volumes in my .yml files. That functionality doesn't appear to be working correctly (or I'm possibly not understanding how it should work maybe?).
Context information (for bug reports)
docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880fe
docker-py version: 3.4.1
CPython version: 3.6.6
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2o  27 Mar 2018
Client:
 Version:           18.06.1-ce
 API version:       1.38
 Go version:        go1.10.3

services:
  alpine:
    entrypoint: ls -al /data
    image: alpine:latest
    volumes:
    - ./temp.dat:/data/temp.dat:rw
version: '3.0'
Steps to reproduce the issue
Using this docker-compose.yml, run docker-compose up
version: '3'
services:

  alpine:
    image: alpine:latest
    
    volumes:
        - ./temp.dat:/data/temp.dat
        
    entrypoint: ls -al /data
Observed result
Starting dirproblem_alpine_1 ... done
Attaching to dirproblem_alpine_1
alpine_1 | total 8
alpine_1 | drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep 30 22:00 .
alpine_1 | drwxr-xr-x 25 root root 4096 Sep 30 22:00 ..
alpine_1 | drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 40 Sep 30 22:05 temp.dat
Expected result
temp.dat would be a file, not a directory.
Additional information
I have the file temp.dat in the directory with my docker-compose.yml file and it is the directory from which I'm running docker up
I've been trying to set up wikijs and a bunch of their examples using docker-compose, show files being mapped. For example, the config.yml file in this examples:
