For my local docker daemon i have SSL on, but client auth turned off.
This configuration works fine when using docker, but docker-compose doesn't seem to accept it.
This is on windows:
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=d:\certs\local
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localdocker:2376
DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=dev
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=0
DOCKER_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_PATH=D:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox

ERROR: TLS configuration is invalid - make sure your DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKER_CERT_PATH are set correctly.
You might need to run eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
