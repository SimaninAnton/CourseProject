Started an application using https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images/blob/master/wildfly-mysql-javaee7/docker-compose.yml as:
docker-compose --x-networking up -d
Creating network "wildflymysqljavaee7" with driver "None"
Creating wildflymysqljavaee7_mywildfly_1
Creating db
The message shows network is created with driver "None" but listing the network as docker network ls shows otherwise:
> docker network ls
