ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Additional properties are not allowed ('x-logging' was unexpected)

You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
same result for version: '2.2' and version: '3'
