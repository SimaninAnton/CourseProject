It is not possible to have the enable_ipv6 directive in the composer file if version is 3.0 or higher. This is not consistent with the documentation (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
To be more precise, here is the docker-compose.yml file I am trying to run:
version: '2.2'

services:
  app:
    image: busybox
    command: ifconfig
    networks:
      app_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.16.238.10
        ipv6_address: fc00::10

networks:
  app_net:
    driver: bridge
    enable_ipv6: true
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
      - subnet: 172.16.238.0/24
      - subnet: fc00::/64
It runs very well with docker-compose up and the ipv6 address is affected to the container.
If I change the compose file to version 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, receive the following error:
$ docker-compose up
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
networks.app_net value Additional properties are not allowed ('enable_ipv6' was unexpected)
Is this an error in the documentation or in docker-compose?
