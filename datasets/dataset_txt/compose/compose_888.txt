Hi,
I am running a react app using create-react-app, and have set up docker-compose.yml to run the project, everything is running fine, i run docker-compose up to run the server, and for build i have created docker-compose-production.yml, so, to create a build i have to run docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up, i wanted to create only a single docker-compose.yml, which on docker-compose up should start the server in development mode, but using docker-compose build-project should create the build.
Here is my docker-compose.yml
`version: '3'
services:
frontend:
build: .
working_dir: /opt/app/
command: npm start
volumes:
- .:/opt/app/
- /opt/app/node_modules
ports:
- "3000:3000"
`
Here is the docker-compose-production.yml
`version: '3'
services:
frontend:
build: .
working_dir: /opt/app/
command: npm run build
volumes:
- .:/opt/app/
- /opt/app/node_modules
ports:
- "3000:3000"
