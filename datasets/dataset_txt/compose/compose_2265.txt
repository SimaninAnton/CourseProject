I do have several compose files. My goal is to combine them using "docker-compose config". The problem is, that docker-compose does not understand its own created file after that.
Given a compose file with an unnamed volume
version: '2'
services:
  test:
    image: ubuntu
    volumes:
      - /config
When running 'docker-compose config'
Then the unnamed volume will be suffixed with ":rw"
Unnamed volumes are currently not allowed to be suffixed with ":rw".
This causes docker-compose to do not understand it's own format anymore.
Error message is like
Creating composeconfig_test_1

ERROR: for test  b'Invalid volume spec "rw": volumeabs: Invalid volume destination path: \'rw\' mount path must be absolute.'
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
Once running docker-compose config again on that file, the volume will be again suffixed with ":rw".
