I have a container that already exists on every node in the swarm, call "certs" but when I run docker compose against my swarm master, it tells me it does not exist.
The container is not running it has just been created.
Compose complains that certs is not a service or container name, yet it exists on every server.
Compose: 1.5.2
Swarm: Master Branch
