We currently have some lightweight documentation about how to use Compose in production, but this could do with improvements:
How to manage releases, particularly when deploying through the Docker Hub (e.g. in development build images, in production use image from Hub)
A step-by-step guide to deploying a Compose app from dev through to production
Some examples of how to deploy apps using init scripts
Some examples of how to deploy apps using Swarm
How to deploy apps on a single server (particularly useful for internal tools, etc)
Resources
Examples of production Compose files
