Problem
When using a docker-compose.override.yml file, $ docker-compose up will exit with a TypeError if the port mappings specified in both the base and override file are not all of the same type. Additionally, the error message produced on exit is not particularly helpful.
Version(s)
Operating system: Arch Linux
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.11.2, build dfed245b

$ docker --version
Docker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e329
How to reproduce
#
# File: docker-compose.yml
#
web:
  image: tianon/true
  ports:
    - 8080 # int
#
# File: docker-compose.override.yml
#
web:
  ports:
    - "8443" # str
$ docker-compose up

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
Workaround
Adjust the port specifications in both files so that they are all the same type (e.g. "8080", "8443")
