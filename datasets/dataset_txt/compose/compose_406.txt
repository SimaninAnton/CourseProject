Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
docker-compose build --parallel outputs mixed output during the build
It's very hard to see which log is what when using shared Dockerfiles for the build
Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like to see a more detailed output, including the name of the service in compose being built
Each line appended with the service
In addition, add some color as it is done during the docker-compose run commands
When applicable (terms with colors)
Describe alternatives you've considered
Just show the of the service being built makes it easier to identify where the logs come from
If coloring is not possible
