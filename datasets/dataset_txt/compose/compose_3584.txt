Requested in #652 and #1347.
It would be nice to allow users to customise container names, perhaps with a name field:
web:
  image: myimage
  name: webapp
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose ps
CONTAINER ID        COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              NAMES
747cb66d30f5        "python app.py"     About a minute ago   Up About a minute   webapp
However, it might not play nicely with docker-compose scale, since names are supposed to be unique.
Some options, keeping in mind that sequential suffixes are probably going away (#1516):
Don't allow services with a custom name to be scaled.
Automatically append a suffix to the name of each container:
webapp_1a2b3c, webapp_4d5e6f, webapp_7a8b9c
Easy enough, but the feature becomes somewhat less useful at that point.
3. Automatically append a suffix to the name of all but the first container:
webapp, webapp_1a2b3c, webapp_4d5e6f
It works, but it's more complicated. What does the logic for creating/scaling look like now?
