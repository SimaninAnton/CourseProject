When I run docker run the container acts "normally".
I have two build context, ./server ./client
The servers job is to grab an XML file and convert it to JSON and serve that JSON file out.
The client then grabs JSON file and displays the data. (nodeJS + react create app)
If I use docker-compose build && docker-compose up the node server.js command fires off, but the JSON file never gets downloaded.
If I build the containers myself (server / client ) and run the containers, everything works as expected.
Can anybody explain why the difference in behavior? And might point me on possible areas to investigate?
This is a private repo, I can show snippets of code, if need be.
