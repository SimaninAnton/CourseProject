Description of the issue
The .env file is only evaluated in $CWD when calling docker-compose
My folder structure is like
~/projects
.env
docker-compose.yml
|-- project-1
|-- project-2
|-- ...
With no .env file present, docker-compose behaves the same if called inside ~/projects or any of its subfolder. However the .env file is only evaluated in the $CWD.
