System specs:
Mac OSX 10.8.5
Python 2.7.2 (built-in)
Fig 0.2.2
My fig.yml:
image: stackbrew/ubuntu
ports:
  - 3306:3306
  - 6379:6379
links:
   - mysql
   - redis
mysql:
  image: orchardup/mysql
redis:
  image: orchardup/redis
When running fig up, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
I tried removing everything from the fig.yml shy of the image entry, and the same error occurs regardless. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
