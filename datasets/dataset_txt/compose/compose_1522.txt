Example:
version: '3.2'
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: 'Asd'
    secrets:
      - source: api-config-v1
        target: config.toml

secrets:
  api-config-v1:
    file: ~/nx_configs/config.toml
docker-compose config will export:
networks: {}
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: Asd
    secrets:
    - source: api-config-v1
      target: config.toml
version: '3.2'
volumes: {}
It works fine with version 3.1
I may found the problem:
https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/config/serialize.py#L10
https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/config/serialize.py#L12
I think it should be:
from compose.const import COMPOSEFILE_V2_2 as V2_2
from compose.const import COMPOSEFILE_V3_2 as V3_2
https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/compose/config/serialize.py#L53
because variable V3_2 contains 3.1 and the version in the config is 3.2
