Hi,
I was trying to pull an image from private registry and I received this message:
[root@baleia sinesp-seguranca]# docker-compose up
Creating sinespseguranca_ldap_1...
Pulling image baleia:5000/sinesp.ldap:latest...

[root@baleia sinesp-seguranca]# 
This is my docker-compose.yml file content:
ldap:
  image: baleia:5000/sinesp.ldap
  command: /run.sh
  ports:
    - "389:389"
    - "9830:9830"
  environment:
    ADMIN_DOMAIN: sinesp.bsa.serpro
    SERVER_IDENTIFIER: sinesp
    FULL_MACHINE_NAME: ldap.sinesp.bsa.serpro
    CONFIG_DIR_ADMIN_PWD: password1
    ROOT_DN_PWD: password2
    SUFFIX: dc=sinesp,dc=bsa,dc=serpro
  hostname: ldap.sinesp.bsa.serpro
And this is my /etc/sysconfig/docker file content:
# /etc/sysconfig/docker

# Modify these options if you want to change the way the docker daemon runs
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled -H fd:// --insecure-registry baleia:5000

# Location used for temporary files, such as those created by
# docker load and build operations. Default is /var/lib/docker/tmp
# Can be overriden by setting the following environment variable.
# DOCKER_TMPDIR=/var/tmp
I have got to push that image on my private registry. What is wrong?
