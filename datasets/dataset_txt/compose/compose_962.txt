I have the similar problem
Version 3
creditcard-monk:
build:
context: ./creditcard
dockerfile: Dockerfile
args:
JAR_FILE: target/creditcard-1.0.0.jar
My requirement is that the jar is present in target directory of creditcard (mentioned in context)
My docker file copies this jar file to the container lib directory .and its failing as the builds are done under docker-lib temp directories.
failed to build: COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder347176151/target/creditcard-1.0.0.jar: no such file or directory
Please help
