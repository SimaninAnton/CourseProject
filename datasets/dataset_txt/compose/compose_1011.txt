Hi,everyone
I have tried to check all the online resource but I still cant get any solution on this.Hope somebody can help me on this.
I trying on portia and scrapy, I have successfully running portia locally, but then when I try to extract the data,It pop out the error.
Error response from daemon: pull access denied for portiacrawl, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
I want to extract the data into json format.
This is the code that I used and try to extract the data
docker run -i -t --rm -v aD:/silverlakething/portia/portia/data/projects:rw -v aD:/silverlakething/output:rw -p 9001:900 1 portiacrawl /silverlakething/portia/portia/data/projects/BigData www.lazada.com.my -o /silverlakethin g/output/www.lazada.com.my.json
This is the Error
Unable to find image 'portiacrawl:latest' locally
D:\silverlakething\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for portiacrawl, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
See 'D:\silverlakething\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe run --help'.
