Hi,
I'm having a problem with docker-compose and MacOS 10.12
In short: on linux all works fine, on mac.. there is huge performance problem.
I'm using it to develop a symfony app. If I use 'dev' version (which don't uses a cache, loads all data from the hdd and so on, each time I refresh the page) page can load up to 1-2 minutes...
Have you faced similiar issue?
One more thing: while refreshing the page, my CPU goes really hight..
I've found other (similiar) issue? with solution: #3419 (comment)
but it won't work on my pc.
What's more strange is that phpmyadmin works fine, without any problem, also quering a database is quick...
