I’d like to to something like that:
services:
  tool:
    volumes:
      - ./app:./app
    working_dir: $PWD
so that I can use the tool from any directory and :
the tool will print paths that are valid on the host
I can pass relative path to the docker-compose run tool and it’ll work automatically
this is not an option:
services:
  tool:
    volumes:
      - $PWD/app:$PWD/app
    working_dir: $PWD
because it would mount only the current directory lots of tools needs the whole project (eg: to read configuration file at the project root)
