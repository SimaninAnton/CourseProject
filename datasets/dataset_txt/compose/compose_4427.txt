Hello again,
This is a really odd bug I came across. I'm still not sure what causes it but I think it's linked to the third services name (and possibly the length?!).
Screencast of the bug happening.
In summary, when I had a fig.yml file setup to boot 3 services, like so..
web:                                                                                     
    build: .                                                                             
    links:                                                                               
        - redis                                                                          
redis:                                                                                   
    image: orchardup/redis                                                               
longNamedService:                                                                        
    build: .
I get an No such service: redis error when running fig up
But if I change the third services name to be really short, such as..
web:                                                                                     
    build: .                                                                             
    links:                                                                               
        - redis                                                                          
redis:                                                                                   
    image: orchardup/redis                                                               
l:                                                                                       
    build: .  
fig up works just fine! Really odd!
