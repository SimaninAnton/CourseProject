I'm attempting to keep my fig processes up using supervisor. If one of my docker processes crashes I would like to restart it. Currently fig doesn't restart it, but it doesn't crash either.
If for example fig up web crashes, it will just sit there showing the exception.
Is it possible to make fig crash too? Allowing supervisor to restart it?
