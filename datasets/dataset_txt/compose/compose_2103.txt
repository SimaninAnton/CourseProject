I have a situation where I needed to run the docker daemon with --bip=192.168.50.1/24 flag, this made sure that my containers get started in that network range by default, thanks to the newly configured docker0 bridge.
As expected, every time I execute docker run ...... my containers get the appropriate IP in the 192 network.
The issue with docker-compose up is that the containers get created in their own network, using a default network of 172.X.X.X, now I know that I can create my own network and configure it accordingly, which is what I did in my compose file, however it feels as if compose's default network should "default" to the docker0 interface?
Using Docker Machine on Virtual Box with docker version 1.12 on Windows 7.
