Im using gelf logging in my docker-compose file and I lose the ability to use fig run <container> bash because it gives the error "Error attaching: configured logging reader does not support reading". An example config is:
my_container:
  image: link-to-image
  log_driver: "gelf"
  log_opt:
    gelf-address: udp://0.0.0.0:12201
    gelf-tag: my_container
I understand that I lose the ability to use docker-compose logs or docker-compose logs my_container but I would expect docker-compose run my_container bash to let me into the container as I am overriding the CMD line manually.
docker-compose version: 1.5.1
Docker version 1.9.0, build 76d6bc9
