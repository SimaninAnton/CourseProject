When trying to scale a service using a fixed hostport, it fails, which is expected. What is not expected (by myself at least) is the attempt is not in the log.
$ docker-compose up
....
$ docker-compose scale web=2

WARNING: The scale command is deprecated. Use the up command with the --scale flag instead.
WARNING: The "web" service specifies a port on the host. If multiple containers for this service are created on a single host, the port will clash.

While the error would not be part of any existing container, it is also not part of the failed container.
user@ubuntu:~/microservice$ docker container logs microservice_web_2

I don't have enough knowledge, but would expect a log aggregator to show this type of activity. Maybe it is showing microservice_web_2 (which happens to be empty). Just curious, am I wrong wanting this type of info in the Compose aggregate log?
Related to this (I think), if you stop a service, you see it in the log, if you start the service again the log shows the previous logs, plus the new logs; but excludes the shutdown log line. Again, I would expect some kind of aggregate and immutable behavior (aka replay the same output as before).
No biggie, just more curious than anything.
