Hi,
this is actually a feature request. Docker was adding the exec command with Docker 1.4 which lets you execute commands on a running container (rather than creating a new container each time, like run does). I would love this to be available in docker-compose as well.
Right now I can use the docker exec command directly, but it is not as convenient as using the commands through compose.
Thanks.
