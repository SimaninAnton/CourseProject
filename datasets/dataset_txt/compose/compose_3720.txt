Hi,
I was wondering how to specify dependencies for a docker. For example I need to build my coreweb before webapplication because webapplication use FROM coreweb in its Dockerfile. However when building containers, docker-compose add the PROJECTNAME_ prefix before container's name so when I create multiple docker-compose.yml for local, dev, stage environments, it names it for example local_coreweb and my container isn't found when building webapplication.
coreweb:
  build: ../Dockerfile/web-application/core/
webapplication:
  build: ../Dockerfile/web-application
Any idea? I did some search in the issues but nothing good was found.
