I run tests with docker-compose, but because it mounts the volume inside when you do it, I have to install dependencies again.
What i do to run test locally:
docker-compose run backend npm test
But on CicleCi I build my containers first with docker-compose build and they are completly runable, but docker-compose makes it easier because it starts links at the same time.
So on circleci i have to do
`docker-compose run backend /bin/bash -c "npm installl && npm test"``
which takes longer because i have to do npm install twice.
I want to do
docker-compose run --no-volumes backend npm test
