I'm having a strange problem running docker-compose config on a project. I use the config command to combine multiple Compose files together for deployment using docker stack deploy --compose-file …. For some reason, when I run config on this project, Docker Compose is dropping the deploy options on the services.
monitoring.zip
The monitoring project consists of three Compose files, specified in .env. Running docker-compose config in this directory produces a config with the deploy options missing.
I'm using Docker Compose 1.11.1.
→  monitoring git:(monitoring-stack) ✗ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.11.1, build 7c5d5e4
