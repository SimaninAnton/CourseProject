I have the following commands in my crontable:
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose pull > /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose build --pull > /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --no-deps -d > /dev/null
I want to supress the outputs and only get error messages, but these still give me the complete output.
Is this a bug? How can I do this?
Thank you!
