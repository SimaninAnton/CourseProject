I'm trying to run several containers with TTY mode enabled (tty: true in config). When I enable TTY mode, commands such as compose up and compose logs do not show the container's output. However I can run docker logs $cid and the output shows up just fine.
The output does show up when the container exits, but not until then. And when it does show up, the first several bytes of the stream are missing. For example:
hello:
  image: busybox
  command: sh -c 'echo hello world; sleep 2; echo done'
  tty: true
# compose up
Recreating code_hello_1...
Attaching to code_hello_1
hello_1 | rld
hello_1 | done
code_hello_1 exited with code 0
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Both lines showed up at the exact same time instead of having a 2 second pause, and note that the hello wo is missing.
This is using current master 43369cd
