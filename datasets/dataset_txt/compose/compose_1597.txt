I'm running docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up my-service with python using Popen, it starts up the containers and all the linked services correctly.
After that, a few moments later, the following message just pops on my terminal.
File "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/compose/cli/main.py", line 64, in main

I followed #1509 but on my system i dont have any ndg-httpsclient.
I saw a similar issue opened #3880 which is exactly the same error, but with no answers.
