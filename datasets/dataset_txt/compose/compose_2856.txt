My use case calls for a random integer to be used as a server id for a mysql replica setup. This can be passed via a docker run command using bash but not an option with docker-compose due to the nature of RANDOM not being listed in the static list of ENV. Naturally it's generated each call.
Docker example:
[moore@host test]$ docker run --rm busybox echo $RANDOM
6735
[moore@host test]$ docker run --rm busybox echo $RANDOM
25738
Compose example:
config...
docker-compose.yml:
randomTest:
   image: busybox
   container_name: rand
   command: echo $RANDOM
run...
$ docker-compose up
WARNING: The RANDOM variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Recreating rand
Attaching to rand
rand |
rand exited with code 0
Could be fixed by catching the instance of the RANDOM key before error and generate an appropriate random integer using python functionality therefore permitting $RANDOM to live in compose workflow too.
