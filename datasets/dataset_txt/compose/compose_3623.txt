Example docker-compose.yml:
dbdata:
  image: postgres:9.3
  command: echo "data only container (might already exists)"

db:
  image: postgres:9.3
  environment:
    DB_PASSWORD: postgres
    DB_USER: postgres
    DB_NAME: postgres
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes_from: 
    - dbdata
Error raised is:
A service can not mount itself as volume
I believe the error is due to the usage of "in" here:
