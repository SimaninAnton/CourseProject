Description of the issue
I would love to be able to set an env variable with default containig $PWD call. I need to use the env var in the container later on, but I cant seem to get it to work.
Example:

    version: '2.3'
    
    services:
    
      extractor:
        image:xxxxxxxx:0.0.15
        environment:
          - INPUT_PATH
          - CRAWLER_PATH
        depends_on:
          - transformer
        volumes:
          - ${INPUT_PATH:-$PWD/test-data/}:${CRAWLER_PATH-/test-data/}
        restart: always
So if not INPUT_PATH is set, use the test-data in the current working directory. It works ok for th CRAWLER_PATH parameter, but not for INPUT_PATH. I tried to set it also in .env file but it would not evaluate either. Would that be possible somehow now, or later on, please?
Thanks
