I tried to install docker-compose via brew (via source), and Little Snitch detected a process with an invalid signature was trying to make network requests. Here are the details:
$ brew install docker-compose

==> python -c import setuptools... --no-user-cfg install --prefix=/tmp/docker-compose--homebrew-virtualenv-20171030-79342-2rewrz/target --sin
==> python -s /tmp/docker-compose--homebrew-virtualenv-20171030-79342-2rewrz/target/bin/virtualenv -p python /usr/local/Cellar/docker-compose
At that point, I get the following error:
I believe the signature shown there is actually iTerm's, and a red herring. However, investigating the python binary shows its signature is invalid:
$ codesign --verify /usr/local/Cellar/docker-compose/1.16.1/libexec/bin/python
/usr/local/Cellar/docker-compose/1.16.1/libexec/bin/python: invalid Info.plist (plist or signature have been modified)

Is this just because Info.plist is missing, or something similarly innocuous? I can install the package from the bottle without any problems, but without knowing more about the failure I'd prefer not to trust that python binary.
Cheers.
