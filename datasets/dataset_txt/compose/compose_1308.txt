I previously had a bunch of sites set up using docker-compose and since upgrading to the latest versions of Docker and Docker-Compose, have been getting the following issues.
Project files on my local machine are no longer being mounted
Each container is attempted to be spun up twice
docker-compose up -d
Starting site_db ...
Starting site_db ... done
