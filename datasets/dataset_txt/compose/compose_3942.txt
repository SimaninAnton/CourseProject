I am packaging an app in docker with fig and I specify several volumes in my fig.yml. When I remove the volumes from fig.yml and run fig build; fig up; the volumes are still in my image. I have tried fig build --no-cache to no avail.
Is this expected behavior and/or how do I remove the volumes from the image that fig generates?
