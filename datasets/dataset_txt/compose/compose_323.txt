We have a container running which is not started with compose which uses/defines several volumes.
With compose v2 we are able to easily use these volumes without knowing (or duplicating) information about these volumes every time by using:
volumes_from:
    container: <name of container>
It seems like this use-case is no longer possible with the compose v3 format.
Was this a deliberate choice? Or could support for this use-case be added to the compose v3 format.
