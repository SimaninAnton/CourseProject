I have a webapp defined by this compose file:
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    command: /bin/bash --login -c "uwsgi --http :8000 --wsgi-file project/wsgi.py"
    tty: true
    build: .
    volumes_from:
      - config
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
  db:
    image: mdillon/postgis
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASWORD=postgres
  config:
    build: .config/local
    command: "true"
    read_only: true
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
config loads a python settings file that configures the environment.
The issue I have is after a while, docker-compose up exits claiming ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run docker-machine start default`. Bizarrely the app still seems to be running as per below, and I can access the website as expected.
$ docker-compose ps
     Name                    Command               State            Ports          
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tappil_config_1   true                             Exit 0                          
tappil_db_1       /docker-entrypoint.sh postgres   Up       5432/tcp               
tappil_web_1      /bin/bash --login -c ./man ...   Up       0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp 
EIther there is an issue with my setup (.config/local/Dockerfile is just 3 lines copying a settings file and declaring the folder as a volume), or there is some issue with a data-only container that's exited, as removing the config service and having the file within the app container on it's own does not bring about these issues.
Any help appreciated. Happy to provide more info, didn't want to bore everyone unless necessary!
