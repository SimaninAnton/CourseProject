AS STATED BY DOCKER:
For the multi-value options ports, expose, external_links, dns, dns_search, and tmpfs, Compose concatenates both sets of values:
original service
expose:
"3000"
local service
expose:
"4000"
"5000"
result
expose:
"3000"
"4000"
"5000"
MY REQUEST:
This behavior causes issues for multi-tenant docker engines when publish(public) ports are used.
If host is already using port 8080, and a new compose file specifies ports: "8080:80", the compose file will fail to launch the service (port in use). The is no way to override the original file's ports: setting, since compose behavior is to "merge" ports. It would be better to make an option for merge or override for ports, e.g.
ports:
"8080:80"
extend: override|merge
I'd like to be able to override any ports specified by a developer with an enterprise override yaml that would add an approved, privately-registered hostport, e.g.
ports:
"11000:8080"
