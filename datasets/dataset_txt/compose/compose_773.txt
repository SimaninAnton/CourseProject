i have two war files and i run them fine on my local computer with docker-compose up command. I tried deploy it with docker-machine tutorial:
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part4/
but i got an error after docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-deploy.yml app saying: "invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist"
I'am not sure how to handle it - and i'm preety sure that this error is caused by CMD ["/bin/sh","/data/app/bootstrap.sh"] from my Dockerfiles.
I dont want to deploy it as two seperate war files to tomcat.
Bellow i give you all details of my project regarding deployment. I changed my username to username:
docker-compose-deploy.yml
    version: "3"
    services:
      app2:
        image: userName/dockerdocker_app2
        container_name: app2
        build:
          context: ./app2
        volumes:
          - .:/data
        environment:
          - LOGGING_LOG-FILES-PATH=/opt/tomcat/logs
        ports:
          - "8000:8080"
      app:
        image: userName/dockerdocker_app
        container_name: app
        build:
          context: ./app
        volumes:
          - .:/data
        environment:
          - LOGGING_LOG-FILES-PATH=/opt/tomcat/logs
        ports:
          - "8001:8080"
My docker-compose.yml does not have image lines.
Also i have two folders: app and app2
in the folder app i have:
app.war, app2.war, bootstrap.sh, Dockerfile
bootstrap.sh
is taking one of the war file and it places it in Tomcat
    #!/bin/bash
    
    WAR_FILE=app.war
    
    cp /data/util/wait-for.sh /
    chmod +x /wait-for.sh
    
    echo "Starting application..."
    rm -rf /opt/tomcat/webapps/*
    ln -s /data/app/$WAR_FILE /opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
    rm -rf /opt/tomcat/logs
    ln -s /data/logs/app /opt/tomcat
    
    echo "Starting Tomcat..."
    
    echo "org.apache.catalina.webresources.Cache.level = SEVERE" >> /opt/tomcat/conf/logging.properties
    export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Duser.language=pl -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -D"
    
    ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/catalina.sh run
Dockerfile:
FROM jeanblanchard/tomcat:8

ENV authType ""
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en
ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8

CMD ["/bin/sh","/data/app/bootstrap.sh"]
in the folder app2 i have:
bootstrap.sh, Dockerfile
The first file only differs in this line:
WAR_FILE=app2.war
The second file is the same expect CMD ["/bin/sh","/data/app2/bootstrap.sh"]
My application runs fine with docker-compose up command.
But i find it difficult to deploy.
I appreciate your help
