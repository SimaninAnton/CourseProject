Please let me know what other information you need.
I'm simply trying to get command line help printed out by running
$ docker-compose
no options no arguments. I just want to view the help.
Results in this error:

Figured something was wrong with urllib3 so I uninstalled and reinstalled like so:
# sudo yum erase python-urllib3
# sudo yum install python-urllib3
This did not change the error.
My system info:
# cat /etc/system-release
