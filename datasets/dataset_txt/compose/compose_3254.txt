Hi,
I have the following docker-compose.yml:
web:
  build: .
  volumes:
   - app:/web/app
which fails with
Running "compass:dist" (compass) task
directory dist/css
    write dist/css/auth.css (1.791s)
    error app/client/sass/not-supported.scss (Line 2: No files were found in the load path matching "notsupp/*.png". Your current load paths are: /web/./app/client/assets/img)

The normal build, i.e.: docker build -t ihr/web . doesn't fail.
