using the following compose file:
---
version: '2'
services:
  aaa:
    image: ubuntu:16.10
running the following:
docker-compose -f compose.yml pull
I get:
Pulling aaa (ubuntu:16.10)...
16.10: Pulling from library/ubuntu
30179d74c3a2: Pulling fs layer
29eedd999b59: Download complete
155740d76144: Download complete
ec1b1466d64c: Waiting
01af7eecc784: Waiting
However, running the following:
docker-compose -f compose.yml pull > pull.stdout 2> pull.stderr
And then looking at stdout or stderr, I don't see any of the "pulling"/"download complete" parts. Where are they hiding?
~$ cat pull.stdout 
16.10: Pulling from library/ubuntu
~$ cat pull.stderr
Pulling aaa (ubuntu:16.10)...
Aborting.
Is that behaviour documented/expected? What stream is used for the messages that don't show up?
Many thanks,
Avidan
