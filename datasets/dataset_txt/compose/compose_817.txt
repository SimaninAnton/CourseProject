I tested on both raspberry pi zero w and raspberry pi 2, and the docker-compose utility takes a lot of time (more than 1 minute) to start building or running things. Not the first time, but every time.
ps: instructions on docker for linux do not work for raspberry
ps2: I'd love to get compose installed together with docker
