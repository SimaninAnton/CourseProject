Just for the start. This is not an issue about environment variable expansion.
I have a definition for a MariaDB:
image: mariadb:10.2
restart: always
environment:
- MYSQL_USER=blabla
- MYSQL_PASSSWORD=123$abc
This raises the warning: Variable abc is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
There is lots of topic talking about environment variable expansion. But none of them talk about $ escaping.
Can you help?
