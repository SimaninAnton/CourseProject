Hi all,
My usecase requires the running app aware of the docker instance name, so that it can push performance metrics to a Elastic Search index with the right container name.
For example, if I scale my "web" tier compose to 3, compose would generate some names like web-myapp-01, 02, 03. I am hoping there is a way for me to access the name from within the web app so that each app could create a new elastic search index like web.metrics.web-myapp-01.xxx.
I have done a few searches and readings, there seems to be no easy way of doing this.
The 1st idea pops in mind is a feature request for docker-compose to add the name parameter as a runtime environment name.
I guess similar things the people have been wanted for IP and port awareness which we now use service registration and discovery to solve can be done the same way.
Please let me know if thats a sensible feature request. If you have a good workaround, I am all ears.
Thank you!
