Hiya,
I'm trying to set up a new registry container with an S3 storage backend.
I went by the guidance at
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/deploying.md
and
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md
But I get
Unsupported config option for storage service: 's3'
Here's my docker-compose.yml:
registry:
  restart: always
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 5000:5000
storage:
    s3:
        accesskey: awsaccesskey
        secretkey: secretkey
        region: region
        bucket: bucket
        encrypt: true
        secure: true
        v4auth: true
        chunksize: 5242880
        rootdirectory: /s3/object/name/prefix
