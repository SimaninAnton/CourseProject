I've noticed that one case where the "ERROR: Container command not found or does not exist." message occurs is when a service refers to a non existing directory in its working_dir: attribute. Having a more helpful message pointing to the problem would had saved me a lot of time instead of focusing on the command: section and not finding anything wrong.
Here's a quick compose file to replicate the error.
version: '2'

services:
  builder:
    image: golang:1.5.3
    restart: never
    working_dir: /go/this-dir-doesnt-exist-and-causes-the-error
    volumes_from:
      - data
    command: ["/bin/true"]

  data:
    image: golang:1.5.3
    container_name: data
    restart: never
    volumes:
      - data-volume:/go
    command: ["/bin/true"]

volumes:
  data-volume:
