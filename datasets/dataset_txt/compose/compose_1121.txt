consider the following docker-compose.yml file:
version: "2.3"

services:
  test:
    image: tutum/hello-world
    healthcheck:
      test: echo | telnet 127.0.0.1 80
      interval: 20s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s
We would expect the first test to occur 5s after the container start (instead of 20s after start)
