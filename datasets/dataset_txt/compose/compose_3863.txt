Given a docker-compose.yml:
web:
  image: nginx:1.7
  ports:
    - 9084:80
node:
  build: test/functional
  links:
    - web
  ports:
    - 127.0.0.1:8080
Executing this will:
$ docker-compose --project-name=B up
...
$ docker-compose --project-name=A run --rm -T -e ENV=staging node npm test
Creating A_php_1...
Creating A_web_1...
Cannot start container 282ac57ac3052dc65c4647c93596504ead598dcc3c29e4b51f4ead123f2d40d7: Bind for 0
.0.0.0:9084 failed: port is already allocated
However I didn't use the new --expose-ports command, so I don't expect it would try to expose port, so I expect it'd not try to bind to port 9084 during the second command.
