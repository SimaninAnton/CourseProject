Hi, I'm trying to use docker-compose version 1.5.1 with docker-machine. My system is Ubuntu 14.04 and the remote system is a RHEL 7.1 system. When i try docker-compose ps, I get this error:
docker-compose ps
ERROR: SSL error: hostname '16.xx.xx.xx' doesn't match 'localhost'
The --verbose log output looks like this:
compose.config.config.find: Using configuration files: ./docker-compose.yml
docker.auth.auth.load_config: Trying /home/eraigosa/.docker/config.json
docker.auth.auth.load_config: Found 'auths' section
docker.auth.auth.parse_auth: Found entry (registry=u'xxxxx', username=u'xxxxx')
docker.auth.auth.parse_auth: Found entry (registry=u'xx.xxx:443', username=u'xxxx')

I saw another issue in the list about updating openssl, but that didn't work for me. Also the workarounds looked specific to OSX. Any ideas?
