Running a container like docker-compose -p "cutter" up will output:
base_theme_builder   | g changed files to targets
base_theme_builder   | ##teamcity[progressMessage 'Applying changes']
base_theme_builder   | ty[progressMessage 'Waiting for containers to stop']
base_theme_builder   | h exited 0
base_theme_builder   | nish.d] executing container finish scripts...
base_theme_builder   | nish.d] done.
base_theme_builder   | sh] syncing disks.
base_theme_builder   | sh] sending all processes the TERM signal.
base_theme_builder   | sh] sending all processes the KILL signal and exiting.
However, running docker-compose -p "cutter" up -d and viewing the logs:
base_theme_builder   | Copying changed files to targets
base_theme_builder   | ##teamcity[progressMessage 'Applying changes']
base_theme_builder   | ##teamcity[progressMessage 'Waiting for containers to stop']
base_theme_builder   | /bin/bash exited 0
base_theme_builder   | [cont-finish.d] executing container finish scripts...
base_theme_builder   | [cont-finish.d] done.
base_theme_builder   | [s6-finish] syncing disks.
base_theme_builder   | [s6-finish] sending all processes the TERM signal.
base_theme_builder   | [s6-finish] sending all processes the KILL signal and exiting.
I will get together a sample repo, but hopefully others can reproduce this easily in the meantime.
This has been since 1.8.0.
