When developing on multiple services, date and time strings added to beginning of each line in logs is a bit annoying. Is there a way to disable the date and time when docker tails the logs? I couldn't find this in any of the log drivers documentations. The only option is to add a timestamp to logs.
I opened the issue here because I think it may be a more compose specific problem.
