When monitoring logs from a service (docker-compose logs -f service1), container starts from a different service will be shown in the log output. The feature in 1.7 to add new containers to exiting log outputs is nice, but should still be limited to containers of the same service when one is specified (ie: only when the scale changes).
To recreate:
version: '2'
services:
    service1:
        image: alpine
        command: sh -c 'while true; do echo "service1"; sleep 1; done;'
    service2:
        image: alpine
        command: sh -c 'while true; do echo "service2"; sleep 1; done;'
docker-compose up -d service1 && \
eval '(sleep 5 && docker-compose up -d service2) &' && \
docker-compose logs -f service1
After five seconds, you will start to see output from both services, even though we just requested logs for service1.
