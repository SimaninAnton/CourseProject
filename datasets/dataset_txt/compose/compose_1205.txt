I am using Linux.
I am trying to add data to Redis from my web application running on Tomcat container.
But I can't store any more data to Redis.When I restart Redis container, the temporarily added data lost.
I configure the docker from using docker-compose.yml
Redis-bitnami/redis:latest
Please update ASAP.
Thanks
