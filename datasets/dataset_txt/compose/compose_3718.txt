Docker commands are organized alphabetically while Docker Compose commands are not. Also Docker and Docker Machine have the option to print version with -v while Docker Compose does not. Related to version is that it is listed as the last option in the aforementioned. Sorry if this sounds like extreme OCD, but I thought it would be good to have all the help output be as uniform as possible.
