Description of the issue
I've installed a fresh Ubuntu 18.04, then docker from repos, then a few containers. Everything was doing fine.
I've then installed docker-composer from repos : docker is now dead, I can't start it, even after rebooting.
Context information (for bug reports)

Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Everything was done as root, so I don't think it's a permission problem.
I've done some googling but didn't find any solution.
Is there a way to get thing back online without re-installing everything?
Thanks
