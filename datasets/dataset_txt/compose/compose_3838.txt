If you start a compose stack with one of the items with n nodes and then downgrade to anything <n nodes, the console will output that one of the nodes had quit with error code 137 and gracefully stop everything.
However, if you start with n nodes, upscale to >n nodes then downscale to n nodes, everything works as intended and the stack will not crash.
Example:
web:
  build: ./web
  expose:
    - "3000"
  restart: always
  environment:
    JOB: web
  links:
    - soa
lb:
  build: ./lb
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  restart: always
  environment:
    JOB: lb
  links:
    - web
    - soa
soa:
  build: ./soa
  environment:
    JOB: soa
  restart: always
  expose:
    - "8301"
    - "8302"
    - "8400"
    - "8500"
    - "8600"
Then (everything is scale=1)
docker-compose up
docker-compose scale web=10
docker-compose scale web=1
docker-compose scale web=10
docker-compose stop
This works, scales, and stops as expected. However after the previous command (that is, when the last scale value for web is 10), if you execute the following
docker-compose up
docker-compose scale web=1
This will say somenode_1 exited with code 137 and gracefully stop the whole thing.
Is this the intended behavior?
