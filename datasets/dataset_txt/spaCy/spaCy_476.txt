spacy version 2.1.6
I trained multiple spacy models which completed without error. But when I tried to reload the models I get the following error
OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en_model.vectors'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
When training I used the en_core_web_lg model to start and added the en_vectors_web_lg on top of that using
spacy.load(voc, vocab=nlp.vocab)
where voc is en_vectors_web_lg
