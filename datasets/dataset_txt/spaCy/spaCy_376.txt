mdl=spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
ttxt=mdl('Our reported interest expense for the years ended December 31 ,2016 ,2015 and 2014 includes non - cash interest related to the accounting for convertible securities of $ 8.1 million , $ 7.9 million and $ 7.1 million , respectively .')
print( [(e.text, e.start_char, e.end_char, e.label_) for e in txt.ents])
('the years ended December 31 ,2016 ,2015 and 2014', 34, 82, 'DATE')
I would like this to have been broken down into three dates as opposed to one big date it is currently outputting.
Looking for suggestions on how to proceed Add custom tokenizer in the pipeline before ner ? Or entityruler ?
