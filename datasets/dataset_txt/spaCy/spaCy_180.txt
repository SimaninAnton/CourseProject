How to reproduce the problem
On a computer with vanilla Windows 10 Professional
Download and install the Windows x86-64 executable installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/.
In a command prompt window, run pip install -U spacy.
Instead of a successful install, I get a litany of errors: errors.txt
