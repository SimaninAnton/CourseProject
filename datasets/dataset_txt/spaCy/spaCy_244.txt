How to reproduce the behaviour
There are few things to improve for the CLI docs and implementation related to jsonl files:
the spacy convert API docs have jsonl listed as the default output, but the default was reverted back to json
spacy train can only read in tuple-style jsonl, not training-style jsonl
more unit tests are needed for the converters
