When running wikipedia_pretrain_kb.py how should the model be linked to? I've tried passing in my parameters like:
python wikipedia_pretrain_kb.py wd_json='./' wp_xml='./' output_dir="./output' model='/Users/spetulla/...lib/python3.7/site-packages/en_core_web_md/'
This doesn't work, however. Despite my best efforts, still getting the "can't find model" exception thrown.
I can load the model from spacy with the same path using spacy.load() however.
Maybe this is the wrong model altogether?
Which page or section is this issue related to?
