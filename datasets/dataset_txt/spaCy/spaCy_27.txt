Hi,
I am running datacamp exercises in my own system but I have some problems, datacamp uses 2.1.0 when I try to use this version in my system I get a bad escape error when loading the models, same thing happens when I use the latest version, problem disappears when I use version 2.0.16. Also when I use conda to install spacy, it auto. installs 2.0.16 rather than latest version.
My specific problem is when I do the following exercise in datacamp:
def get_wikipedia_url(span):
# Get a Wikipedia URL if the span has one of the labels
if span.label_ in ('PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'LOCATION'):
entity_text = span.text.replace(' ', '_')
return "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=" + entity_text
Span.set_extension("wikipedia_url", getter=get_wikipedia_url, force=True)
doc = nlp("In over fifty years from his very first recordings right through to his last album, David Bowie was at the vanguard of contemporary culture.")
for ent in doc.ents:
# Print the text and Wikipedia URL of the entity
print(ent.text, ent._.wikipedia_url)
I get the named entities but when I run the same piece of code in my own system I get a empty tuple as output
My Environment
Operating System: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6
spaCy version: 2.0.16
Platform: Darwin-17.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version:** 3.7.0
Models: en
Thanks a lot
