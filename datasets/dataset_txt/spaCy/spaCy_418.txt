I think its worth noting in the init-model documentation that if you just start with a word2vec vector file, the vocabulary will still depend on spacy's vocabulary (or at least, thats what it looks like in the code). It took me a while to figure out why the word "cop", which was in my file, didn't have a vector loaded in (because it wasn't ever created by init-model)
Which page or section is this issue related to?
