When installing in a fresh environment (dockerized python:3.7-slim in this case), the __version__ attribute does not correspond with pkg_resources.get_distribution('spacy').version (the version passed in setup.py - setup()). This is leading to unexpected errors in our implementation, and makes me doubt whether pip install is a stable way of installing older versions of spacy.
How to reproduce the behaviour
pip install --upgrade 'spacy<2.1'
Collecting spacy<2.1
