I'm using spaCy for NER Training for adding a new entity type.
My initial setup was Manjaro Linux on a Dell Latitude laptop with an Intel i5-5300u and 16GB of RAM, and after one iteration of my data using spacy train en output train.json validation.json -p ner I obtained ~16000 CPU WPS with 100% CPU usage (on one core only).
Info about spaCy
spaCy version: 2.2.3

(same results with python 3.7.6)
I moved this project (same training files, same python packages, all the same) on a MacBook Pro 15 2015 with i7 2.2Ghz (should be i7-4770HQ) 16GB and macOS Catalina.

Now with this configuration, I obtain ~13000 CPU WPS with the CPU that is far away to reach the 100% mark, even on a single-core, like the Dell with Linux.
I think that with the MacBook's CPU I have to get better results (maybe only a little), am I wrong? Is this the correct behavior or for macOS there is something that I have to keep in mind?
Thank you for your help
