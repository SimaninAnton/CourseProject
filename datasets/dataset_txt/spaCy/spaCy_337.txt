When I visit the website of the displaCy demo, and I scroll down to see the code below the displaCy Named Entity Visualizer heading, some text seems to be missing. In reality, the color is simply set to the same color as the background. Specifically, this is the culprit
[data-demo=displacy-ent] .d-wrapper code {
    color: #1e1935;
}
When removing this style, the code is nice and white-ish.
I could not find the code to the demo in this repo, so I just filed an issue here.
