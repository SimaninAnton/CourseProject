Feature description
I'm looking for an efficient way to add data augmentation into my TextCategorizer training workflow â€” namely, by applying a variety of transformations to a given Doc and thereby producing a new, similar-but-distinct document. There's a variety of transformations in the literature, but many come down to either swapping two tokens present within a given document/sentence or replacing tokens outright.
Is there any way that the existing Retokenizer could incorporate .replace() and .swap() actions? I appreciate that the resulting sequence of tokens could become ungrammatical, but I don't know what the implications would be for spaCy.
Currently, I'm taking a Doc and using its annotations and vectors and such to produce a transformed text string, which I then use to create a new Doc, then repeat for the next transformation. It's inefficient. Would be awesome to have some built-in functionality to assist.
Could the feature be a custom component or spaCy plugin?
If so, we will tag it as project idea so other users can take it on.
Probably! tbh I'd like to incorporate the higher-level data augmentation functionality into textacy, I'm just hoping for a less hacky / more efficient solution.
