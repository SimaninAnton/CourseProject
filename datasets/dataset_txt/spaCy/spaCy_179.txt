The instructions at https://spacy.io/usage suggests they work with Python 3.8: at the top, it says spaCy is compatible with "64-bit CPython 2.7 / 3.5+". That invites users to just jump in.
That needs to be clarified. Per #4581, Python 3.8 requires you to compile spaCy. Therefore, the instructions should state that you can't simply jump in at the top if you have Python 3.8. Otherwise, users will get errors that are hard to decipher.
