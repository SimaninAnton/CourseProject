Problem description
Tokens are merged (or didn't split, to begin with) when email-like text is parsed, however, the like_email flag is false.
How to reproduce the behavior
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en", disable=["parser", "tagger", "ner"])
resume_text = "a,b@mail"  # text that does not look like an email address
doc = nlp(resume_text)
print([t.text for t in doc]) # => ['a', ',', 'b@mail'], 3 tokens

resume_text = "a,b@mail.com"  # Text that looks more like an email address 
doc = nlp(resume_text)
print([t.text for t in doc])  # => ['a,b@mail.com'], 1 token, and `like_email` is False. AFAIK is should still be 3 tokens
