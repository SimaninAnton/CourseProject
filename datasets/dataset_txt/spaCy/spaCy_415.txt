I'm looking into the Spacy documentation for a way to set the number of layers for the simple_cnn (or ensamble) architecture for a TextClassifier.
I've found the depth parameter in the documentation for the pretrained models https://spacy.io/api/cli#pretrain
Is there a similar parameter for the TextClassifier based models?
If not what is the default number of layers for a Simple CNN based model?
