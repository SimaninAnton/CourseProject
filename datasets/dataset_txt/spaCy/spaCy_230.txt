Although I raised this issue ages ago (#593) and I know some work has been done on it, I just want to let you know there is still a discrepancy in the way spacy maps fine POS tags to coarse POS tags for English.
Specifically, the current spacy tag_map maps PRP$ and WP$ to PRON while Universal Dependencies map them to DET (UD tag map). These are words like "my car" and "whose car", which UD lists as examples of determiners (link).
I also noticed some old information on the annotation specifications page:
https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging
Specifically, the header in the Universal Part-of-speech Tags tab says you use the Universal Dependencies scheme, while the headers in the English and German tabs say you use the Google Universal Tagset. The latter is no longer true (although maybe it is for German?)!
