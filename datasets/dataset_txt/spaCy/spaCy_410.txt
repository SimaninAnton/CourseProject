Hi, I'm wondering that shouldn't the language code for Serbian be sr rather than rs (according to ISO 639-1)?
And since Serbian uses either the Cyrillic alphabet or the Latin alphabet, is there any need to distinguish between the two writing systems (e.g. sr-Cyrl for Serbian Cyrillic and sr-Latn for Serbian Latin according to ISO 15924) in spaCy to make things more clear (the newly-added stop words for Serbian in #4078 uses the Cyrillic alphabet)?
