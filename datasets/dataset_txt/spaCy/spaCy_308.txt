How to reproduce the behaviour
With lower case:
>>> import spacy
>>> nlp = spacy.load('es')
>>> sentence = "no."
>>> doc = nlp(sentence)
>>> for token in doc:
...     print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_)
...
no. no. ADJ
>>>
with uppercase:
>>> sentence = "No."
>>> doc = nlp(sentence)
>>> for token in doc:
...     print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_)
...

I don't expect punctuation to ever be included in my tokens.
