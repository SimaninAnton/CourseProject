I'm encountering an issue where when I load my latest NER model and test it on a document, it produces a different result if I remove a single sentence from the beginning of the document
I tested with two separate models and you can see an example below
I added a sentence to the first document with a fictitious person entity
Then removed the first sentence
Is this normal?
I find it strange that such a short sentence would have such a profound effect on the predictions
Models were trained using spacy 2.1.8
with custom vocabulary using word2vec using the following parameters
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
word2vec = Word2Vec(all_words, min_count=2, window=5, size=200, sg=0, workers=5)
