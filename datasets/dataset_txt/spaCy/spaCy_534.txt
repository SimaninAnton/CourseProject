Hi,
I am running below simple code to obtain all tokens that contains the word ( for example, words containing acompared, notcompared, thiscompared).
But, the spaCy regrex does not return anything. The regular expression word fine on python re.
Could you let me know if this is an spaCy issue or how resolve the issue?
import plac
from spacy.lang.en import English
from spacy.matcher import PhraseMatcher, Matcher
from spacy.tokens import Doc, Span, Token
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = """
"Net income was $9.4 million acompared to the prior year of $2.7 million.",
"Revenue exceeded twelve billion dollars, with a loss of $1b. run",
"""
doc = nlp(text)
pattern = [{"LOWER": {"REGEX": "\b\wcompared\w\b"}}]
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
matcher.add("item", None, pattern )
matches = matcher(doc)
print(matches)
print(matcher)
Thanks,
Saul
