Hi!
I'm trying to make SpaCy work in SageMaker JupyterLab notebook. I managed to install SpaCy using this line in terminal: conda install -n python3 -c conda-forge spacy.
But I struggle to download models.
I can import spacy in my notebook but when I run this line in my terminal (in python3 environment) python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
I get this error:
ImportError: Something is wrong with the numpy installation. While importing we detected an older version of numpy in ['/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/python3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy']. One method of fixing this is to repeatedly uninstall numpy until none is found, then reinstall this version.
The same error I get when I run this python -m spacy info --markdown
I uninstalled and installed numpy again, but it didn't help.
Any suggestions, please!
