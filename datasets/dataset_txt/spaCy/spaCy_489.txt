Is it possible to make changes to the result spacy provides before passing it to evaluation method?
What I want to do is iterate over the found entities and if one is a false positive (that I know for sure by other means) I want to remove it from the spacy result. Then I want to evaluate the modified result against my gold standard after having removed the false positive items. I know the evaluation would no longer be a true representation of spacy performance, and I'm doing this because I'm combining spacy with another process to produce a final result and I want to evaluate the combined performance.
Is this possible?
