Hi Ines,
I'm using the code below from your documentation to export images of dependency parses, however, it throws up 'TypeError: write() argument must be str, not None'.
print(type(svg)) shows svg to be a <class 'NoneType'>
I don't seem to be able to find a solution online, do you have any suggestions please. Hopefully a quick solution which should take too much of your time!
`import spacy
from spacy import displacy
from pathlib import Path
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
sentences = [u"This is an example.", u"This is another one."]
for sent in sentences:
doc = nlp(sent)
svg = displacy.render(doc, style="dep")
file_name = '-'.join([w.text for w in doc if not w.is_punct]) + ".svg"
output_path = Path("/images/" + file_name)
output_path.open("w", encoding="utf-8").write(svg)`
