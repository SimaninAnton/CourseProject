I tried running my example in your binder (https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#tokenization)
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"Trypsin-sensitive photosynthetic activities in chloroplast membranes from Chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1.;Location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or insolubilized trypsin.")

for ent in doc.ents:
print(ent.text, ent.start_char, ent.end_char, ent.label_)
Trypsin 0 7 GPE
Chlamydomonas 74 87 GPE
As for I understand GPE is the geopolitical entity which includes Countries, Cities or location. However the result it is throwing is a chemical or an organism name.
Is there some way to rectify it.
