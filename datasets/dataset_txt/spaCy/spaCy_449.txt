I was doing some tests and found that the quality of spaCy's output drastically decreases when the input is not cased. Especially for named entity recognition that is true. For instance, when you try the sentence:
I saw Obama and Trump shaking hands.
Cased, there aren't issues (even though Trump is marked NORP). But lower-cased, the model doesn't recognize any named entities. See here.
This begs the question: is spaCy only trained on cased data? If so, it might be useful to make this more explicit in the documentation.
