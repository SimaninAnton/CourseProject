I made many custom components of spacy, and sometimes I want to put same components in one nlp pipeline.
I tried changing one of their name and they can be put in one pipeline, but that made it impossible to restore with spacy.load.
So it is great if nlp.meta can holds spacy_factories to avoid confliction.
