Hi,
NER is incorrectly combining 2 MONEY entities as one in the following sentence:
"Q2 2019 revenue decreased $1.2 million to $23.5 million, from $24.7 million in Q2 2019." I am using en_core_web_lg for processing the above.
Is there a way to correct this and have separate entities for "$1.2 million" and "$23.5 million"? (NOTE: It is correctly identifying "$24.7 million" as a separate MONEY entity).
The fully list of entities that the application is extracting for this sentence is:
[second quarter 2019, $1.2 million to $23.5 million, $24.7 million, second quarter 2019]
Thanks for your help,
Ronny
