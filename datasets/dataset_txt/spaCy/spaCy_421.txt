I am trying to setup Spacy on Mojave 10.14.6. I get this persistent build error.
pip install spacy
warning: include path for stdlibc++ headers not found; pass '-stdlib=libc++' on the command line to use the libc++ standard library instead [-Wstdlibcxx-not-found]
spacy/_align.cpp:833:14: fatal error: 'complex' file not found
#include
^~~~~~~~~
2 warnings and 1 error generated.
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
I see the header files in /usr/include and yet it will not build. Does spacy work with the latest version of MacOs?
