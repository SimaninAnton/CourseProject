For my use-case, I read a document (multiple sentences) and perform some cleanup in the pipeline. This includes sending the document via a coref pipe to replace some text content. Another custom cleanup could include removing sentences that are irrelevant. The question I have is:
A. is there a way to update and/ or delete text from the original text?
B. If so, Is there some way I can retokenize the document?
Currently, I store the text in an intermediary file / stream and re-open it as a new doc. Thanks
