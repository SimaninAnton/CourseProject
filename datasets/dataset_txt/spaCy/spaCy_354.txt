Hi! I was just importing the model(en_core_web_lg) and I got this error - [T008] Bad configuration of Tagger. This is probably a bug within spaCy. We changed the name of an internal attribute for loading pre-trained vectors, and the class has been passed the old name (pretrained_dims) but not the new name (pretrained_vectors).
My Environment
spaCy version: 2.0.18
Platform: Darwin-18.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.7.2
Models: en_core_web_lg
