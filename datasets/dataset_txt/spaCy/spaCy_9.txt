How to reproduce the behaviour
nlp = spacy.blank("en")
docs_golds = [("", {})]
nlp.evaluate(docs_golds)
Causes the error:
        gold_deps = set()
        gold_deps_per_dep = {}
        gold_tags = set()
>       gold_ents = set(tags_to_entities([annot[-1] for annot in gold.orig_annot]))
E       TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
