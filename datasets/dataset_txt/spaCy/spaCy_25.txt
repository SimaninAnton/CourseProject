I asked this question on StackOverflow more than a week ago so I wanted to to try my luck here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59504980/how-do-i-robustly-strip-quotations-from-news-articles-using-spacy
I'm looking to essentially take this Github Issue a step further: #3196.
My goal is to remove or tag quotations from news articles, but I'm not sure how to robustly do so. I want to treat tokens inside quotes differently than tokens outside. For example, I would like to ignore entities found within quotations for my current use case.
My current implementation is brittle to unmatched quotes and also seems inefficient since its using the Matcher in a while loop for each document. One idea I had was ditching the Matcher which matches at a token level and start using something that allows me to take whitespace into account so I can match "\s. Would love any help.
Thanks!
