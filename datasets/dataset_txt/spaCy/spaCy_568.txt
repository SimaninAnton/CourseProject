Hi, I am encountering some problems with the German POS tagger. Even though the tokenizer works correctly on \u201e and \u201c, the part-of-speech does not work.
How to reproduce the behaviour
nlp = space.load('de_core_news_md')
text = "\u201eDas ist nicht gut.\u201c"
doc = nlp(text)
for tk in doc:
  print(tk.text, tk.pos_)
In this case, is assigned VERB and \u201c PROPN.
However, the following works as expected:
nlp = space.load('de_core_news_md')
text = "'Das ist nicht gut.'"
doc = nlp(text)
for tk in doc:
  print(tk.text, tk.pos_)
