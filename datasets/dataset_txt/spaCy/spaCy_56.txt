How to reproduce the behaviour
I have installed spaCy inside my conda environment by following the instructions provided by the official website https://spacy.io/usage. I obviously selected the instructions for conda. However, I have noticed that the spaCy package causes a conflict with the bash command tr. Below the error that appears:
(spacy) geektoni@uriel:~/Github/spacy$ tr
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/geektoni/miniconda3/envs/spacy/bin/tr", line 10, in <module>
    sys.exit(tr())
TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable
This happens because spaCy install inside the bin directory of the conda environment an executable called tr and this will be called instead of the "standard" tr (calling which tr results in /home/geektoni/miniconda3/envs/spacy/bin/tr instead of /usr/bin/tr)
The following steps can be used to reproduce the error:
conda create -n spacy python=3.6
conda activate spacy
conda install -c conda-forge spacy
conda install -c conda-forge spacy-lookups-data
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
tr # This will cause the error
