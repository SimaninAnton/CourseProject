I live in China. When I want to download the en_core_web_sm model, the download speed becomes below 1KB/s and then timed-out. When added --default-timeout=3600 option, what surprisingly works, I receive pip._vendor.urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ("Connection broken: ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')", ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')), after some time passes.
