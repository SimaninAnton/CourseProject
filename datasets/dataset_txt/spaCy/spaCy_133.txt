Thank you for your service and support for spacy and prodigy which we just bought!
I want to teach the model to recognize specific types of dates in a text document.
So I wish to run through all the dates, perhaps using...
prodigy ner.teach your_set en_core_web_sm C:\Users\Yishai\Downloads\lease-7.txt --label DATE
then I want to tell the machine which ones should be labeled as start dates and which are end dates.
Is this considered training a new entity type?
Thanks!
Which page or section is this issue related to?
