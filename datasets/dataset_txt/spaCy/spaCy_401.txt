Hi,
I want to know if there is an elegant way to get the index of an Entity with respect to a Sentence. I know I can get the index of an Entity in a string using ent.start_char and ent.end_char, but that value is with respect to the entire string.
For example in the following code -
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion. Apple just launched a new Credit Card.")

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.start_char, ent.end_char, ent.label_)
I want the Entity Apple in both the sentences to point to start and end indexes 0 and 5 respectively.
Basically, I am trying to achieve similar to this SO Question but for Entities rather than tokens.
