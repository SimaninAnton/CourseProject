Feature description
The Named Entity Recogniser is great for displaying named entities, what would also be great is the ability to also display custom attributes along with the named entities.
Using the token based matching structures, initialistion might go from:
displacy.serve(doc, style="ent")
to:
custom_attributes = [{"" : {"ATTRIBUTE1" : "VALUE"}, {"" : {"ATTRIBUTE2" : "VALUE"}]
displacy.serve(doc, style="ent", custom = custom_attributes)
Could the feature be a custom component or spaCy plugin?
Displacy is a custom component so this suggestion should be possible.
