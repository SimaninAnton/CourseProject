Which page or section is this issue related to?
In Chapter 2, section "Data Structures Best Practices", Part 2, the solution is not a general solution and would not work for strings which end in a Proper Noun. To fix this, I used this code instead:
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Berlin is a nice city")

length = len(doc)

for token in doc:
  if token.i + 1 < length:
    nextToken = doc[token.i + 1]
    if token.pos_ == 'PROPN':
      if nextToken.pos_ == 'VERB':
        print("Found proper noun before a verb:", token.text)
