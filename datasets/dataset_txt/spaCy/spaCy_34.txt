Hi! Please forgive me if this question was already raised somewhere, I tried searching first but couldn't formulate it properly for Google. Also, sorry if this is not formatted correctly.
My question is - I know that you can train the model to recognize new named entities, however, my problem is the opposite. Is there any way to tell the model to "forget" certain entities that are not recognized correctly and not to recognize them anymore? For example, I was going through some law voting transcripts, there are words "Aye" and "No", and "Aye" gets recognized as a person, even when it's lowcase. Is there any better solution for this apart from just building a stop-word list for such cases?
