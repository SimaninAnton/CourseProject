Feature description
Converting things back and forth between tokens, spans and entities is often laborious. A function like
def get_ent_from_token(token):
    return [ent for ent in doc.ents 
            if ent.start_char <= token.idx <= ent.end_char][0]
simply returns the entity of which the supplied token is a part. I submit that Token should have Token.ent as an attribute that would supply the entity's span if it exists or return [] is tok.ent_type == 0.
