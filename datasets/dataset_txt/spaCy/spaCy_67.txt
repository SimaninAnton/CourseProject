In named entity recognition Spacy always recognizing apple as an organization, never recognizing as a fruit.
I tried the below code:
import spacy
nlp=spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')
doc= nlp(u'Apple is my favourite fruit , it's cost around \u20B9 10 in India')
for token in doc:
print(token,end='|')
print('\n....')
for ent in doc.ents:
print(ent.text+'-'+ent.label_+'-'+str(spacy.explain(ent.label_)))
Why Spacy is not recognizing apple as fruit and â‚¹10 as monetary value.
Please help me on this.

Venkat
