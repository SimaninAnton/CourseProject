I wonder how spaCy's textcat computes scores for longer passages. Since CNN typically requires a fixed length sequence (typically when I train CNN models for text classification). But for longer passages, does spaCy simply chops off part of a long passage, or does it do some kind of averaging based on individual sentences (if there are multiple sentences). Thanks!
