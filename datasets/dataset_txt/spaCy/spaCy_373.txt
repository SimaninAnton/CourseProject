How to reproduce the behaviour
Using the french model fr_core_news_sm leads to a bad interpretation of word "musique" when it is given alone.
Incorrect behaviour
It is recognized as ADJ while it can never be an adjective as it is always a noun (even if the verb "musiquer" exists, but if the word is used isolated it is a noun).
import spacy
spacy = spacy.load("fr_core_news_sm")
text = "musique"
for token in spacy(text):
    print(token, token.tag_)
text2 = "la musique"
for token in self.spacy(text2):
    print(token, token.tag_)
musique ADJ__Number=Sing
Correct behaviour
When it is in a sentence like "la musique" it is well recognized as NOUN.
import spacy
spacy = spacy.load("fr_core_news_sm")
text2 = "la musique"
for token in self.spacy(text2):
    print(token, token.tag_)
