How to reproduce the behaviour
in gold.pyx#L539 it appears as if the static from_annot_tuples function unpacks a tuple of length 7, but in the constructor gold.pyx#L635, self.orig_annot is populated with a length 6 tuple (discarding the cat annotation). This is creating a bug in the scorer.py score function where the gold object is reconstructed with from_annot_tuples function. I discovered this bug when trying to override the cli train function.
