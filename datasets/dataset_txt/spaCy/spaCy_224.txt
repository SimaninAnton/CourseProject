The documentation for PhraseMatcher should be more explicit about how to pass in a list to PhraseMatcher.add().
The documentation specifies the type of the 3rd parameter as *docs or List, which is a bit misleading. *docs is technically correct, but the add() method actually fails when providing a list of Doc objects with the error:
  File "phrasematcher.pyx", line 193, in spacy.matcher.phrasematcher.PhraseMatcher.add
TypeError: an integer is required
Which does not indicate a list cannot be passed. Perhaps it should be more explicit in the example? I lost my morning to this, so I figured I'd make this issue just in case anyone else has the same problem.
Which page or section is this issue related to?
