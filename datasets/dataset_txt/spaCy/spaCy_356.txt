I can not read Greek, but looking at the nouns in the lemma_index.json file for Greek, these are the first several entries:
"(ιρλανδικά)", "(σκωτικά)", "(σοράνι)", "-αλγία", "-βατώ", "-βατῶ", "-ούλα", "-πληξία", "-ώνυμο", "sofa", "table", "άβακας", "άβατο", "άβατον"
I'm pretty sure parentheses don't belong there, and the things that begin with hyphens and "table" and "sofa" seem out of place.
Maybe this is due to a bug in the Wiktionary parsing script mentioned by @giannisdaras in #2558?
If someone who speaks Greek could check and clarify what, if anything, should be removed, that would be great.
