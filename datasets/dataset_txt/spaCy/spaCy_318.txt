I couldn't figure out how to re-open an issue, so I am creating a new one with a link to the previous #3047.
The behavior is still present.
Basically, here is the line where the assertion is triggered.

I can't quite figure out from the code what is the variable size trying to represent here. Perhaps, I can do some workaround, but I need to understand the root cause.
Also, if there is a different recipe for getting the confidence on the extracted entities, I am happy to consider that (I haven't found an alternative)
