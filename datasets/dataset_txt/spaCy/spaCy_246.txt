Spacy already has a NER but it doesn't link with KBs due to which the NER looks erroneous. NER are also restricted with generic classes like PERSON, ORG, LOCATION. An extension with wiki data, freebase and DBPedia KBs can help in a natural extension of them.
Current NER result:
Input: I like watching Harry Potter
Output: Harry Potter (PERSON)
Proposed NER result:
Output: Harry Potter (book/movie)
P.S: Examples like I like watching Netlfix find Netflix as PERSON tag. It would have been disambiguated correctly with the use mentioned KBs.
Therefore, I think Spacy should have this feature to be superior in entity extractions.
