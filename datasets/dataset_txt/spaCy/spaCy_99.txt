Hi
I'm new to spaCy and at the moment, I'm looking for the best ways to use it for dependency parsing.
Results from https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy
en_core_web_lg
Change the color to red. => color => red[dep=relcl]
Change the color to green. => change => to[dep=prep] => green[dep=pboj]
Change the color to yellow. => change => yellow[dep=advcl]
Change the color to pink. => change => pink[dep=advcl]
en_core_web_sm
Change the color to pink. => change => pink[dep=advcl]
Change the color to green. => change => green[dep=advcl]
Change the color to yellow. => change => yellow[dep=advcl]
Change the color to red. => change => red[dep=advcl]
It seems all the models do not have the same stability
I would expect the lg model to be more stable than the sm.
What the best way to insure the most stable parsing ?
