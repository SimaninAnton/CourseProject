Feature description
I downloaded the en_core_web_lg package and I want to use it for similarity, but I have some special words, which the vectors are zero and I want to add the vector. What is the order?
for example:
    nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')

    vector_data = {u"maestro": np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (300,)),
                   u"bot": np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (300,)),
                   u"nugget": np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (300,))}
    vocab = Vocab()
    for word, vector in vector_data.items():
        vocab.set_vector(word, vector)
Could the feature be a custom component or spaCy plugin?
If so, we will tag it as project idea so other users can take it on.
