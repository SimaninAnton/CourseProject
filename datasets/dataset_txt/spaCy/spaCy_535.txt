How to reproduce the behaviour
Since pos attribute of tokens is now writable (related comment ), I ran into the issue that I changed the pos tag and serialized the doc but on deserializing, it retained the original pos tag.
I believe this is happening because only the tag attributes are pickled
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
d = nlp("displaCy uses JavaScript, SVG and CSS to show you how computers understand language")
print(d[0].pos_) # prints ADJ
d[0].pos_ = "NOUN"
d.to_disk("t.txt")

d2 = nlp("")
d2.from_disk("t.txt")
print(d2[0].pos_) # prints ADJ
Wasn't entirely sure if this should be a bug or a feature request to make pos tags picklable or maybe documentation could be added specifying how serializing would not save changes in coarse grained attributes with pos tag as examples
