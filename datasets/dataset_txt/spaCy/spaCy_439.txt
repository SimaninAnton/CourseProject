Hello, I'm new to Spacy and trying it out. Really enjoyable stuff, thanks. Spotted one small thing working through the docs:
Which page or section is this issue related to?
URL: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features
In the NAMED ENTITY EXAMPLE, this line
nlp = spacy.load("custom_ner_model")
doesn't work for me. Replacing it with the standard model "en_core_web_sm" works perfectly fine.
If I try to install it with python -m spacy download custom_ner_model, I get the error message âœ˜ No compatible model found for 'custom_ner_model' (spaCy v2.1.4).
