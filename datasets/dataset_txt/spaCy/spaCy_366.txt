I have a custom NER model created in Spacy and loaded from file. Trying to add an entity ruler as per code below. Output is either the ruler or ner but not a combination where entities wouldnt overlap.
Is this a bug or am I missing somthing?
ner_model_ruler = spacy.load(r"***path_to_model***")
patterns=[{"label":"COVER_TYPE_R","pattern":[{"LOWER":"word_1"},{"LOWER":"word_2"}]},
          ..... ]
ruler = EntityRuler(ner_model_ruler,validate=True)
ruler.add_patterns(patterns)
ner_model_ruler.add_pipe(ruler,after='ner') 
Help would be very much appreciated.
