We are trying to build ner model for custom entity recognition . We tried with 10 samples as shown from https://spacy.io/usage/training
It is not recognizing any custom entity
do we need to provide the correct grammar data for training ?
what is the minimum training data for custom named entity model ?
Do we need to load 'en' or 'en_core_web_sm'?
ner losses are low if we train 10 samples. If we give same sentence from training data , it is not recognizing?
