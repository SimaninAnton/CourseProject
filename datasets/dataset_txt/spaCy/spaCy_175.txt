I have gone through the docs several times but I can't understand what spaCy is doing when creating a model from scratch ?
So I have my custom own training data & I am building a blank english model from this using the NER pipeline only.
What type of neural network is used in this scenario ? Is it as suggested in this article ?

If so how are the word embedding's being produced ?
Could really do with help on this please & thanks for your great product (grovel, grovel :))
