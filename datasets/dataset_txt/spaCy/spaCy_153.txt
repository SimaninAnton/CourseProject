After installing spacy pip3 install -U spacy and downloading python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm, I can run the following code:
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("de_core_news_sm")

text = "Das ist den Tisch"

my_doc = nlp(text)

token_list = []
for token in my_doc:
    token_list.append(token.text)
print(token_list)
Then I tried to debug the code (on Pycharm) and got the following error:
OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'de_core_news_sm'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
I have also tried the solution from #4577 but did not work!
import de_core_news_sm
nlp = de_core_news_sm.load()
Does anybody know the reason and how to fix it? Thank you in advanced!
