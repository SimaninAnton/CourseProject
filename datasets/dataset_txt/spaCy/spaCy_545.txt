Feature description
There was an issue reported in #1143 but the stated solution (to modify egg-info) is not adequate for many use cases. For example, in a lot of Python projects it is customary to automatically parse the entries of requirements.txt and populate the install_requires field in setup.py when building a package.
If some of the dependencies need to be specified as git URLs, it can make this process needless complicated to deal with dependency links and updating egg-info tags.
Why not build spaCy downloadable artifacts as proper installable packages? This would be especially nice because the artifact can specify the range of versions of spacy that are compatible, and then users can specify everything with pinned versions like usual in a single place, and ensure their combination of spacy and downloaded artifacts will 'just work' regardless of what type of packaging / environment situation they are working in.
Please consider changing the existing data set release procedure to build proper pypi-distributed packages (and also conda-forge to be extra awesome).
Could the feature be a custom component or spaCy plugin?
If so, we will tag it as project idea so other users can take it on.
