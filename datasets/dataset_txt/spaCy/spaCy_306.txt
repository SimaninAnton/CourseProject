Feature description
It looks like these kinds of cases aren't easy to handle with the train CLI:
I want to train a model from scratch given vectors, one corpus for the tagger, and one corpus for the parser. (See example in #4306.)
I have a model with a tagger and want to add a parser trained on a separate corpus.
For the internal spacy models, it looks like each component is trained separately and then they are combined using custom scripts.
Could it make sense to have a CLI component that combines models/components (with compatibility checks, of course)?
Case (2) is really just a minor variant of (1), but the train CLI might be able to handle it relatively easily by combining the components in model-final, for example. I think case (1) could be handled by the train CLI in theory, but the command-line options would get too complicated and it would be easier to handle it with a separate CLI command.
(What is the right way to combine the vocab directories (aside from vectors) for multiple models?)
