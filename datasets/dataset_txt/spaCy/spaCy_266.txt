Hello,
Although I can run an experiment to see which way performs better, I wanted to hear from the developers regarding if there is a recommended approach to deal with duplicate sentences in the training data.
I'm doing NER on medical reports. After sentencizing a report, its possible that eventually I'll encounter numerous sentences that are identical to each other with the exact same string. Even though all reports in my training set are different, there are sections of text which are identical
Currently I'm checking for these duplicate sentences (the ones without any entities) before adding them to my training set and keeping only one instance, but I wanted to know if that's ok or should I just use everything even if the training set would contain sentences that are duplicates.?
