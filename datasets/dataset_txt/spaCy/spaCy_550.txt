I know this issue was already posted in #1752, but I'm actually having the exact same problem, even though it was supposed to be fixed in #2159. I am loading different NER models which are contained in the ner_models folder in the NLP pipeline, as following:
How to reproduce the behaviour
for i, model in enumerate(os.listdir(path+ "/ner_models")):
    ner = EntityRecognizer(nlp.vocab)
    ner.from_disk(path+ "/ner_models/" + model, vocab=False)
    nlp.add_pipe(ner, "ner" + str(i+1))
I then get a segmentation fault when I apply the model to a sentence in which entities are detected by one of the NER (code 0xC0000005 with PyCharm), am I missing something?
