I am trying to load nlp with fasttext vectors. I have initialized Spacy as it is suggested on https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity and loaded nlp with the same path which I provided to spacy init-model. I successfully loaded vectors, but I was not able to iterate sentences since sentence boundaries were not set. The same code with Spacy native model works fine.
Is there missing information in instructions on how to load custom vectors or an issue with the code?
