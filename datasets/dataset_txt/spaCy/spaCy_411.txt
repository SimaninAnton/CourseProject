Creating a master issue for some of the reported Matcher bugs, especially those related to 'OP': '?' (optional tokens) to keep things in one place. We believe that they're all likely related to the same root cause and should be fixed at the same time. Each reported test case is already reflected in a regression test.
#3879: False positive matches on subsequent OPs in the Matcher patterns
Regression test: test_issue3879.py
#3951: Issue with several optional rule in Token Matcher
Regression test: test_issue3951.py
#4120: Matches without a final {OP: ?} token are not returned
Regression test: test_issue4120.py
