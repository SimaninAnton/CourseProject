I have a task which is half a matcher and half an entity extraction. I want to label some words that in some contexts refer to some label. Named entity extraction would be the way to go, but these words do not necessarily share structure (they can be verbs, nouns... etc). I could simply use a dictionary, but I would like to use context to label them. I am having trouble finding a solution to this problem. Can NER function of spacy be used for this or is this a completely different task?
