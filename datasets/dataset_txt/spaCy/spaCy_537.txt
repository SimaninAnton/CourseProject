How to reproduce the behaviour
Code:
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en")

sentences = [
    "Fruits, for example bananas, oranges and peaches.",
    "Fruits, for example, bananas, oranges and peaches.",
    "Fruits, for example apples, bananas, oranages and peaches.",
    "Fruits, for example, apples, bananas, oranges and peaches.",
    "Fruits, for example apples, bananas, watermelons, oranages and peaches.",
    "Fruits, for example, apples, bananas, watermelons, oranages and peaches."
]

cnt = 6

for sentence in sentences:
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    results = list([i for i in doc.sents][0].noun_chunks)
    if cnt & 1:
        print("'for example,' with comma")
    else:
        print("'for example' without comma")
    print("Sentence: {sentence}\nReal Examples: {coe}\nNumber of noun phrases:"
          " {len_of_result}\nResults: {results}\n\n".
         format(sentence=sentence, coe=cnt//2,
                len_of_result=len(results), results=results))
    cnt += 1
Outputs:
'for example' without comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example bananas, oranges and peaches.
Real Examples: 3
Number of noun phrases: 5
Results: [Fruits, example, bananas, oranges, peaches]


'for example,' with comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example, bananas, oranges and peaches.
Real Examples: 3
Number of noun phrases: 5
Results: [Fruits, example, bananas, oranges, peaches]


'for example' without comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example apples, bananas, oranages and peaches.
Real Examples: 4
Number of noun phrases: 6
Results: [Fruits, example, apples, bananas, oranages, peaches]


'for example,' with comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example, apples, bananas, oranges and peaches.
Real Examples: 4
Number of noun phrases: 5
Results: [Fruits, example, bananas, oranges, peaches]


'for example' without comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example apples, bananas, watermelons, oranages and peaches.
Real Examples: 5
Number of noun phrases: 7
Results: [Fruits, example, apples, bananas, watermelons, oranages, peaches]


'for example,' with comma
Sentence: Fruits, for example, apples, bananas, watermelons, oranages and peaches.
Real Examples: 5
Number of noun phrases: 6
Results: [Fruits, example, bananas, watermelons, oranages, peaches]
From the example above, we shall see that the noun phrase, 'apple' in this example, right behind "for example, " will be ignored by spacy when the number of example noun phrases are greater than 3. However, there's no such problem when using "for example" without a comma.
