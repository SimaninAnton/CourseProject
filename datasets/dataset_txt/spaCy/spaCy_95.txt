How to reproduce the behaviour
Hello,
I'm trying to extract a list of adjectives from a sentence into a span.
Simple setence such as "Die Farbe sollte rot, blau oder schwarz sein" can be extracted properly. I gained my wished result which is "rot, blau, oder schwarz" as the new tag/span (by using spaCy dep_ and children_)
But it's not working as I expected, when I added a subclause into it "Die Farbe sollte rot, blau oder schwarz sein, aber nicht grau oder braun"

The word "rot" and "blau" have the same dependency, which is "pd".
I use "pd" in my code as an indicator of the (new) span starts token, because of it I gain "rot" and "blau oder schwarz" as seperated span.
I would like to know which approach should I use fix change the word "blau" dependency into "cj", should I trained the model using what it said on this website https://spacy.io/usage/training? Thanks in advance.
P.S : I try also following examples..
"Die Stadt sollte in Karlsruhe, Berlin oder Stuttgart sein, aber nicht in London oder Manchester": accurately extracted
"Das System sollte schnell, einfach und robust sein, aber nicht teuer oder komplex": inaccurate extracted
So maybe the issues is only for adjectives..
