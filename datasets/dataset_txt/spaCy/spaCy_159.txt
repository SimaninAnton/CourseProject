I want output as ["good customer service","great ambience"] but I am getting ["good customer","good customer service","great ambience"] because pattern is matching with "good customer" also but this phrase doesn't make any sense. How can I remove these kind of duplicates
import spacy
from spacy.matcher import Matcher
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("good customer service and great ambience")
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

# Create a pattern matching two tokens: adjective followed by one or more noun
 pattern = [{"POS": 'ADJ'},{"POS": 'NOUN', "OP": '+'}]

matcher.add("ADJ_NOUN_PATTERN", None,pattern)

matches = matcher(doc)
print("Matches:", [doc[start:end].text for match_id, start, end in matches])
