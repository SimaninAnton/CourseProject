Great to see nb_core_news_sm released!
I would really like a model with word vectors, so I've picked up my work from #3082 (and https://github.com/jarib/spacy-nb) to build Norwegian Bokmål models of various sizes against spacy 2.2.2.
I've noticed two things:
Reproducability
The released nb_core_news_sm model gives much better accuracy scores than the sm model I build myself from what is presumably the same data source. I haven't found any code that shows how you preprocess the data from NorNE. Is it proprietary? Do you use the train/dev/test split that they provide? How many iterations do you run?
jarib/spacy-nb sm nb_core_news_sm
TOK 100.00 100.00
POS 94.03 95.70
UAS 88.51 89.31
LAS 85.37 86.72
NER P 71.90 83.69
NER R 70.53 83.45
NER F 71.21 83.57
Outdated morph_rules
The NorNE data has been updated (improved) since I last used the data. It now uses 30 POS tags that are missing from nb/morph_rules.py. You can see the output of spacy debug-data here. If I run debug-data against the older version of NorNE it has no errors.
What would be the best approach to fix this? Looking at nb/morph_rules.py it seems to do things differently from other languages (e.g. en).
