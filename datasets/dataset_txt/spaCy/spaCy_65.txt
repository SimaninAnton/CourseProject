Hello all,
I am just wondering if anyone has an idea of how to tokenize the below text without considering the xml elements but keeping the attribute values using set_extension for the corresponding token. For example, I want to save the attribute values (i.e. tid, type,etc) for "now" token. Any suggestion?
e.g. parsing the below text and not considering the xml element as a token
 The Navy has changed its account of the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.
 Officials <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF" temporalFunction="true" anchorTimeID="t0">now</TIMEX3> say the ship was hit <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">nearly two hours </TIMEX3>after it had docked.
 Initially the Navy said the explosion occurred while several boats were helping
 the ship to tie up. The change raises new questions about how the attackers
 were able to get past the Navy security.
, but saving the attributes values as well:
Token.set_extension('tid',force=True, default=None)
Token.set_extension('type',force=True, default=None )
now._.tid="t1"
now._.type=Date
