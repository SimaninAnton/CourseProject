Currently, extensions are something that gets defined on a global, system wide basis.
I think this is a serious design flaw since it severely restricts how spacy can be used.
It is not hard to find situations where people would want to use several pipelines, several languages etc. within the same system and clearly, extensions would ideally be specific to a pipeline. This would allow to have several pipelines which all may use different extensions.
Of course, there is nothing that would prevent us from declaring shared callbacks for several pipelines.
