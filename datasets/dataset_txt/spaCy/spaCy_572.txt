Environment Information:
Based on #3676, it is OK to use paragraphs as training data (each piece of training data is a paragraph), as opposed to sentences. In the example from your website, the training data can be annotated in the format below, where the indices indicate the start and end positions of a named entity.
train_data = [
    ("Uber blew through $1 million a week", [(0, 4, 'ORG')]),
    ("Android Pay expands to Canada", [(0, 11, 'PRODUCT'), (23, 30, 'GPE')]),
    ("Spotify steps up Asia expansion", [(0, 8, "ORG"), (17, 21, "LOC")]),
    ("Google Maps launches location sharing", [(0, 11, "PRODUCT")]),
    ("Google rebrands its business apps", [(0, 6, "ORG")]),
    ("look what i found on google! ðŸ˜‚", [(21, 27, "PRODUCT")])]
If each piece of training data is a paragraph, should I annotate the positions the same way, only now the start and end positions are with respect to the full paragraph? So for the sample data below which is a short paragraph consisting of two sentences, if I want to annotate "San Diego", the positions would be the positions in the paragraph?
train_data = [
    ("It's going to rain tomorrow. I think you should bring an umbrella with you to San Diego.", [(78, 87, 'GPE')])]



Thanks!
