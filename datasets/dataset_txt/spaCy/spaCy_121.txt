I am trying to train a NER model from scratch. I have successfully built train.json, dev.josn, and test.json. I issue the below command to start training:
python -m spacy train xx out train.json dev.json -p ner
I have a PC with +60GB of RAM. spaCy occupies all but ~500MB. After some time and doing nothing, it stops and spits something like "not enough memory"!
I had this very problem with spaCy 2.2.2 too.
I use python v3.7.5, spaCy 2.2.3, and Windows 10
