Spacy recently added support for fasttext vectors, but it is not clear to me how to package them, along with the info about subword features. init-model does not look like it knows to work with both the word vectors and the ngram vectors.
The approach I have been using so far is to create a custom Spacy component which sets the
vector user_hooks to a wrapper function which knows how to properly embed even OOV words.
However, later on I realised that these vectors hooks are not used throughout training, since the Tok2Vec expects to find the vectors pre-loaded in the vocab.
Could you tell me if I am missing something or if there is an easy work-around?
