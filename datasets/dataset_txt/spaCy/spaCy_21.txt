We OCR'd a number of images, the OCR was fairly noisy so we ended up with some exotic characters. These characters were causing the NER to fail during training
I suppose it was due to the fact that some of the noisey characters were not part of the english language character set
nlp = spacy.blank('en')
In our initial approach we tried replacing all non word characters with spaces using some simple regex
ocrCleanedText=str(re.sub(r"(?!/)\W","",ocrCleanedText))
However this causes an issue where we introduced spaces at the start & end of entities
which causes the training to fail. We can work around this but it seems to be a wrong approach to process with.
I am beginning to look at ASCII conversion type methods now but I would like to know what would you recommend as a gold standard approach ?
Are there any helper method in spaCy that would allow us to identify any non English characters set ?
