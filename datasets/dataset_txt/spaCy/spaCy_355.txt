As shown in the table in https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#pos-tagging, spacy differentiates two kinds of POS tags (POS and TAG). Probably I'm just a newbie, but is there some docs, which kind of philosophy these are based on? TAG seem to be based on Penn TreeBank tags, POS on a more universal set (as in Petrov, Slav, et al. "A Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset"). Any additional explanation on this would be helpful for the docs I guess, especially for people like me ;-)
