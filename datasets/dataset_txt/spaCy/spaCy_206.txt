How to reproduce the behaviour
Hello, due to work network restrictions, I cannot use python -m download..., so I use a downloaded model and just try to link it. However, although it links successfully, it is not available in my environment (and isn't reflected in SpaCy info).
$ python -m spacy link ./en_core_web_md-2.1.0.tar.gz en
Linking successful
Documents/SPACY_en_Models/en_core_web_md-2.1.0.tar.gz
--> /Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/spacy/data/en

You can now load the model via spacy.load('en')
$ python -m spacy info
