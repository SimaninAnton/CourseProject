Hi,
I'm trying to train an existing NER model for a new set of entities, but after training it is forgetting the old entity types and remembering only the new ones. Anyone could help me, please?
I have followed the tutorial from spaCy documentation: https://spacy.io/usage/training#ner
Setup:
Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
Python Version Used: 3.7.4
spaCy Version Used: 2.2.1
Regards,
George
