The documents I work with are typically on the larger side (Articles, emails/email threads). When I do the following:
results = []
for doc in nlp.pipe(docs, batch_size = 100, as_tuples = True):
    doc, docid = doc
    results.append([docid, doc])
The GPU utilization rate is around 3% - 7%. I wonder if there is any suggestion/tips on how I can increase GPU utilization Also as a side note, my GPU's memory is 16 Gb, so this limits how big the batch size can be -- I tried 200 docs, but it was clearly too big as I got an cupy out of memory error.
