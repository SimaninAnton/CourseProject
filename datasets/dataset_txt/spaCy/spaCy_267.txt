I'm trying to follow the entity linking documentation but I don't really follow.
It seems like the documentation on an entity linker shows how to do custom linking. But what if you just want to use the out of the box Wikipedia linking? How do I set that up? Seems like it's a matter of running the scripts but I'm not sure which ones or in which order.
Which page or section is this issue related to?
