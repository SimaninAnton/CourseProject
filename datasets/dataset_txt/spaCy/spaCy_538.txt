I have a 2015 MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14.5
Python 2.7.16
pip 19.1.1
gcc version 5.1.0
I tried upgrading to the latest spaCy with different options eg --no-use-pep517 , --no-binary etc. They didn't work and removed old spaCy - installing with no options didn't work.
Error message excerpts look like:
