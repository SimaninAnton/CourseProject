I have installed spacy and downloaded en_core_web_sm with:
pip3 install spacy
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
When I try to run the en_core_web_sm module in Python IDE with:
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
it shows an error message:
 File "/home/disha/Desktop/project/python/parser/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/spacy/__init__.py", line 30, in load
    return util.load_model(name, **overrides)
  File "/home/disha/Desktop/project/python/parser/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/spacy/util.py", line 169, in load_model
    raise IOError(Errors.E050.format(name=name))
OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
I have tried every possible solution which was suggested on GitHub and Stack Overflow but nothing worked
Operating System: Ubuntu
Python Version Used: 3.6
spaCy Version Used: 2.2.3
Can somebody help me fix this issue? Thanks in advance!
