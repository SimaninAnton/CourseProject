Thanks to your help, I was able to accomplish two things:
Train a new entity type, based on the example py file you provided here.
Train a model using the command line based on the example you provided here.
But what I want to do now is combine these two things.
Can I train a new entity type via the command line?
Or maybe no, I should just hard code my new entity types into the py file...
What do you think?
Many thanks!
