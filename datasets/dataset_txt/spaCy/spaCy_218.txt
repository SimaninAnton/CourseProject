How to reproduce the behaviour
self.nlp = English()
sentencizer = self.nlp.create_pipe("sentencizer")
self.nlp.add_pipe(sentencizer)
faq_answerr_token_doc = self.nlp("The weekly off/holidays, during the rainy period, shall not be counted as a leave in a government office. (Weekly off refers to employees who are in support roles working on a follow the moon model, granted a weekly day off in lieu of weekends).")
It should break the sentence at "." but it is breaking at "(".
Hence the response looks like below:
1.) The intervening weekly off/holidays, during the leave period, shall not be counted as leave. (
2.) Weekly off refers to employees who are in support roles working on a follow the sun model, granted a weekly day off in lieu of weekends).")
