I am developing a resume parser where I have used spacy to parse 'Name' from a resume. Everything is working fine when I'm running it using 'python3 manage.py runserver' command. But after I have deployed it in a apache server, its hanging just after loading the spacy language module. Earlier it was freezing while loading only, but that got resolved after installing spacy-nightly. But now it is freezing while I'm passing any text through through the object created after loading the module.
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
print('encoreweb')
doc = nlp(text)
print('name')
Its printing 'encoreweb' but its not going to the next print.
