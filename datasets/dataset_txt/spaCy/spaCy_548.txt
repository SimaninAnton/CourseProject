I'm deploying an app on PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) that uses SpaCy and I'm having error when install SpaCy.
The manifest file is:
applications:
- name: xxxxx
  instances: 1
  memory: 2048MB
  disk_quota: 2048MB
  command: python app.py
  buildpack: python_buildpack
  stack: cflinuxfs3
  timeout: 180
The error I'm getting is:
Command "/tmp/contents587794960/deps/0/bin/python -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;file='/tmp/pip-install-ralx3p8i/spacy/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(file);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, file, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-record-sx4g4727/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code -9 in /tmp/pip-install-ralx3p8i/spacy/
I have seen others reporting this error but it was due to Python version, but mine's different (unless PCF is messing things up).
I was able to deploy exactly the same app on Heroku with no above error.
