Feature description
As i understand from the documentation, we can match sentence using rules with adding patterns,
example :
import spacy
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

doc = nlp(
    "i want to buy an iPhone X"
)
pattern1 = [{"TEXT": "iPhone"}, {"TEXT": "X"}]
pattern2 = [{"TEXT": "Samsung"}, {"TEXT": "S 10"}]

matcher.add("Phone", None, pattern1,pattern2)
matches = matcher(doc)
print("Total matches found:", len(matches))

for match_id, start, end in matches:
    print("Match found:", doc[start:end].text)
the program will return :
Total matches found: 1
Match found: iPhone X
in this step, the program has successful extracted the iPhone X, and it was due to the match.add method call.
in our implementation, we need to identify witch pattern was successful ( in this example [{"TEXT": "iPhone"}, {"TEXT": "X"}] was the pattern chosen to return this result).
