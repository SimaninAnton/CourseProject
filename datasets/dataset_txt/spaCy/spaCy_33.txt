How to reproduce the behaviour
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("This _ is missing _.")
print([(t, t.pos_) for t in doc])

# outputs [(This, 'DET'), (_, 'PROPN'), (is, 'AUX'), (missing, 'VERB'), (_, 'PROPN'), (., 'PUNCT')]
With en_core_web_lg you get the same result, just with NOUN instead of PROPN. The result is the same regardless of the part of speech of the word or words it's replacing in the sentence. It also tags strings of underscores as several proper nouns or nouns in a row (e.g. "The _______ is on _____ table.")
