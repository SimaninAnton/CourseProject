Extract recurrent patterns using rule-based matching: Rule-based matching.
I want to extract the pattern "X such as Y1, Y2,..., Yn-1, and Yn." from a sentence. X is a hypernym and Yi is a hyponym.
Let's take an example:
doc = nlp("GDP in developing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh will continue growing at a high rate.")

# Matcher class object
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

#define the pattern
pattern = [{'DEP':'amod', 'OP':"?"},
           {'POS':'NOUN'},
           {'LOWER': 'such'},
           {'LOWER': 'as'},
           {'POS': 'PROPN'}]

matcher.add("matching_1", None, pattern)
matches = matcher(doc)
span = doc[matches[0][1]:matches[0][2]]
span.text
Output: 'developing countries such as Vietnam'
The desired output is 'developing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh'. How to perform this task using spaCy?
Thanks in advance.
