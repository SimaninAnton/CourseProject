Hello,
I am migrating to Python 3 and would like to use the latest spacy with model en-1.1.0 .
As explained in https://pypi.org/project/spacy/ ("Support for older versions")
I unpacked en-1.1.0.tar.gz into spacy/data . I then used
spacy.blank("en").from_disk('.../lib/python3.7/site-packages/spacy/data/en-1.1.0')
(This is a conda environment)
and got error messages - that "init.py" was missing.
I this possible at all to use this model?
If not, which of the new models supercedes it?
Thanks,
Yuval
