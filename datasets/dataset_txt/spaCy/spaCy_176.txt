Hi,
I've been attempting to install spaCy on Pycharm but with no luck.
How to reproduce the problem
Installation using: pip install -U spacy
spaCy is working well in Jupyter notebook, just now need to transfer to Pycharm for handling a large set of code.
The installation seems to fail at the point of installing Blis. After looking through previous issues both on Github and Stackoverflow it seems this is a 32bit to 64bit problem. I don't seem to be able to create a win64 venv in pycharm (I realise this may be out of scope for a spaCy installation problem)
Have been trying to sort this for three solid days now, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated!!
