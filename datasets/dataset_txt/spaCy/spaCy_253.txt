Not sure if this is something that exists already or if this is a request but -
The PhraseMatcher is obviously very fast at finding matches in a document which is great. However loading up the matcher takes quite a bit of time. since I am loading up the same patterns every time I am wondering if there is a way to serialize the matcher or save it after loading it once so that reloading is faster. I am creating the phrasematcher from a gazetteer with ~26k lines and it takes ~3 minutes to do so.
