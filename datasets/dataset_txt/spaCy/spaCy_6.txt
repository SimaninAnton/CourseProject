How do I do transfer learning i.e. take pre-trained Spacy NER model and make it learn new entities specific to my use case?
For this, I have 100 new annotated training samples. The new retrained model should only predict the new entities and not any of the existing entities in the pre-trained spacy model. Just adding/updating new entities to existing models and ignoring the old entities during prediction doesn't make sense.
This official example describes how to add new entities to existing pre-trained entities but that's not what I want. I also have very few examples i.e. 100 to completely built a new NER model from scratch.
Edit: I want to identify all account numbers in an unstructured document.
Example ("I would like to change address corresponding to my account 12345. Kindly let me know how to do it. " [34, 39, 'accountnumber'])
