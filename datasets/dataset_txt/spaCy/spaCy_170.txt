I want to extract the start and end date from the text of a contract. I am currently able to color and label all the DATES using displacy.render(doc, style="ent"). But again, I need to distinguish between start and end date. Any idea how I can do that? Maybe apply more training to a model? How can I do that? Thanks for your help! yishairasowsky@gmail.com
