I am probably doing something stupid, but this appears to be something new in code I've used for quite some time.
I have a custom model that contains both a text classifier and a named entity model. When training each component, I disable to other pipe so as to not attempt to train with nonsense. This is right out of example code.
Here's what happening though...when I train ner, any previous training for textcat and the named pipe disappears. Same when I train textcat on model that contains ner, it disappears? I have no idea what's happening
Should I be enabling the previously disabled pipe before I save to disk? What am I missing? I've had stable models so just now getting back into intense training.
