I am training a NER model from scratch. I have added the beam search functionality to the query logic. This means that I can get a probability for Test data I send to the model. This is in line with the code in previous posts #881
However it has also been suggested that to get more stable results you should train your model with the beam settings also being set to customized values of your choosing.
Have you any example of code to do this ?
I had been looking at doing it using
os.environ['SPACY_BEAM_WIDTH'] = '16'
os.environ['SPACY_BEAM_DENSITY'] = '0.0001'
However when I look at the ner\cfg file it still has the default values
{
"beam_width":1,
"beam_density":0.0,
"beam_update_prob":1.0,
....
}
This seems to indicate it hasn't picked up my settings ?
