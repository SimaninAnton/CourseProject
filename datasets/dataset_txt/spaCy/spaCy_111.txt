Hello,
I am a newbie with spaCy, currently trying to understand the terminologies and workflow - BTW I find sometimes the spaCy documentation introduces NLP jargon and tasks assuming the reader already knows the subject -
I wrote this question in scispaCy issues, with no answers so far, which made me think it could be more relevant to spaCy too: I tried scispaCy with a NER task using en_ner_bionlp13cg_md. Unfortunately it recognizes entities in a wrong way i.e.: "Americas" as ORGANISM, "Columbus" as CANCER, etc. so this is my question:
Could I chain different models?
Like using both en_ner_bionlp13cg_md and en_ner_bc5cdr_md?
If yes, how do I specify "priority"? For example: I would like to prioritize on geopolitical entities using model A but for gene names use model B?
Does this make sense?
Is this what the "pipeline" concept refers to?
Thank you for reading.
