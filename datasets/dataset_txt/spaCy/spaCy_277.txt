Hello,
I'm using Spacy for NER and would like to improve accuracy by adding a PhraseMatcher after the NER step. According to the EntityRuler doc, I can add spans to the Doc.ents, however I need exactly opposite - to exclude incorrectly predicted spans. For instance Spacy NER always predicts the type of the span AAAA to be X, which is always incorrect.
Is it possible to use EntityRuler API to unmatch incorrectly recognised entities/spans.
