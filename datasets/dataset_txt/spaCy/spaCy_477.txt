Feature description
My task is to extract/segment information from a semi structured text. But not only the text is important some "external features" are also important.
For example, imagine that I want to segment this text about GitHub projects in Category, Project name, URl and description.
I utilize an BIO scheme to tag each html token as a category.
Where
token=NLP start_of_p=True bold=True center=True B-Category
token=Projects start_of_p=False bold=True center=True I-Category
token=Project start_of_p=True bold=True center=False B-Project-name
token=Name start_of_p=False bold=True center=False I-Project-name
token=: start_of_p=False bold=False center=False I-Project-name
The final result is something like:
Pay attention that some features are important such as: Text formatting (italic, bold, centered), position in text and more...
This would be a scenario where Spacy can work with?
I can see a lot of moviment around Tok2Vec. But looking at
spaCy/spacy/_ml.py
Line 322 in 87fcf31
 def Tok2Vec(width, embed_size, **kwargs): 
, apparently it still glove | norm | prefix | suffix | shape only.
There is anyway of using those custom external features for training Spacy?
Thank you!
