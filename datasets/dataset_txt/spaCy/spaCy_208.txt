Feature description
My team (and I assume a lot of other companies) are using spacy 2.0 and 2.1 in various places. We have A LOT of trained models in spacy 2.0 and 2.1. It would be great to have the fix @adrianeboyd made here #4486 for the memory leak ported back to the older versions as well since it's a really small change with a pretty huge impact.
i.e. It's much easier to upgrade to spacy 2.1.9 from 2.1.8 rather than 2.2.2 and retrain all the models we have.
Thanks!
And not sure this counts as a feature request but didn't seem like a bug either haha.
