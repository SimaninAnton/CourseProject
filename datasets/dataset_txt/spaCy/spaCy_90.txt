I'm trying to use spacy noun_chunks.
I downloaded the model with python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
noun_chunks = nlp.noun_chunks
but it's throwing an error:
AttributeError: 'English' object has no attribute 'noun_chunks'
Operating System: Ubuntu
Python Version Used: 3.6
spaCy Version Used: 2.2.3
Can somebody help me fix this issue? Thanks in advance!
