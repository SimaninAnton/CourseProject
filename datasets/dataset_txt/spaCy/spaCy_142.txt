How to reproduce the behaviour
#4649 Hi, this is a follow up with the problem since it is closed. I don't mean to create a representative model, just want to figure out why the saved model is different from the model before saved. I upgrade the spacy to 2.2.2 and still have the issue. I reproduce the error using Google Colab. link
