I might be remembering wrong but wasn't it possible to match on the norm of a word a while back with the Token matcher?
I can't seem to find anything about it in the documentation anymore, nor creating custom norm exceptions.
I would use it for having a norm for single-token month expressions (that would be faster than having a matcher setting custom attributes, right?)
