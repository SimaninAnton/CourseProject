This is one of the most puzzling and not very well documented details about Spacy:
the Matcher apparently only allows to match a subset of token attributes and requires that instead of the original names of those attributes, special all-uppercase identifiers have to be used. Why? Why not allow to use all Token attributes and by their original name?
The entity ruler examples seem to indicate that lower case, original name attributes can be used. But the documentation does not really say much about this or if other features of the matcher like value ranges, operators and quantifiers can be used.
Ideally the token matching in the entity ruler would work identically to the matcher and both would allow to use all Token attributes with their original name.
