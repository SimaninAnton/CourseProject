Trying to use huggingface neuralcoref with spacy version 2.1.6 and receive the following error when I try to add coref to the pipe:
RuntimeWarning: spacy.tokens.span.Span size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 72 from C header, got 80 from PyObject
Have already tried this:
pip uninstall neuralcoref
pip install neuralcoref --no-binary neuralcoref
Right now the only solution seems to be using spacy 2.1.3 or lower but I need version 2.1.6 - anyone else running into this?
Operating System: Mac OS
Python Version Used: 3.5.1
