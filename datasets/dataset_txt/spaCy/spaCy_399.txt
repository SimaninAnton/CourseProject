Feature description
Sometimes it is difficult to retain the original structure of text from which we recognize named entities. For example I have text between standard html tags(ex. web page source) and while recognizing named entity from text I remove all the html tags and give raw text to Spacy NER engine but after prediction if I want to display text in original format with surrounded html tags it is not possible. it will break the originality of data.
if there is feature in spacy that can ignore specific pattern while recognizing named entities from text it will helpful to retain the originality of text.
Could the feature be a custom component or spaCy plugin?
If so, we will tag it as project idea so other users can take it on.
It will be a custom component so other users can specify the pattern which they want to ignore.
