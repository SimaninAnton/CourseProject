Spacy offers pre-trained vectors for words. However I have noticed that you can get vectors for sentences too:
spacy_nlp('hello I').has_vector == True
However I can't figure how it calculates the word2vecs from the sentences. I've tried:
spacy_nlp('hello I').vector == spacy_nlp('hello').vector + spacy_nlp('I').vector
False
spacy_nlp('hello I').vector/spacy_nlp('hello I').vector_norm == spacy_nlp('hello').vector/spacy_nlp('hello').vector_norm + spacy_nlp('I').vector/spacy_nlp('I').vector_norm
False
I can't seem to find or work out how spacy computes the w2v for sentences.
