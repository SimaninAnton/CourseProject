Feature description
Although technically they are Spans (which do not have indices per se), it would be nice to somehow access the indices of a Doc's sentences:
def get_sentence_index(ent):
    return [i for i, sent in enumerate(doc.sents)
                 if sent.start_char <= ent.start_char 
                 and sent.end_char >= ent.end_char][0]
perhaps by having the generator supply a tuple containing the index.
