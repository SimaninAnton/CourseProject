Apologies for what is likely a simple failure to find the right documentation. I understand Spacy recently added Entity Linking. How do I enable this in the default pipeline? What model do I need to install to bring this capability? Sample code would be very helpful.
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp.add_pipe(nlp.create_pipe("entity_linker"))
doc = nlp("The Democratic Party has cycled through various candidates.")
Throws error:
Model for component 'entity_linker' not initialized. Did you forget to load a model, or forget to call begin_training()?
Where do I get the model? Thanks!
