Feature description
It would be nice if during the merging of noun chunks the lemma would also be properly set. Currently, the lemma of the merged token is the lemma of the first word in the noun chunk sequence, which I don't think is the desired behavior in most cases.
Additionally, it would be nice to have more flexibility in setting the attributes of the merged token. For example, I would like to keep the entity type of the root token as the entity type of the whole merged token.
