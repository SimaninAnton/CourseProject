Referring to #3082, I have been in contact with the legal owner of noWaC, the dataset we wish to base a norwegian spaCy model on together with @jarib. They are unable to change the license of the corpus itself due to norwegian law (se explanation in section 1.2 in the noWaC paper), but are willing to set up some special agreement which would allow us to use the corpus to generate the language model. They have a standard contract available, where we could set the cost of the license to 0, and specific terms specified in Appendix 2. I also think we should further discuss the duration of the contract with them.
As pointed out by @ines here, the language models could count as derivative works based on the corpus.
@honnibal @ines, what do you need the terms of the contract to include? Also, is it sufficient to have the agreement in Norwegian? Do you perhaps have a template we could base the contract no, or alternatively, if their contract is used, what should be included in Appendix 2?
