Environment Information:
Suppose that I have a lot of emails in which people mention certain account numbers associated with an online service. It could be something along the line of the following (the sequence of #'s represents account numbers):
"My account # is #########"
"######### is my account number"
"our account #'s are the following: #########, #########, #########"
"The number you provided to us (#########) does not match the your account number in our system."
These account numbers follow certain rules that can be captured by regex (not just any sequence of 9 digits). However, there are also many other number sequences that can be captured by the same regex -- notably, some conference call services' access codes follow the same patterns, resulting many false positives.
So this leads me to wonder if it is possible to use spaCy to train on custom data like the sentences show above to identify and extract these account numbers. Crucially, I don't want the model to learn specific sequences of number combinations -- that is, if I train on 2000 sentences, I don't want the model to simply learn the specific sequences of numbers present in the 2000 sentences.
Thanks!
