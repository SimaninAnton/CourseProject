sentence = "The Cleveland Chamber of Commerce is more a good-government organization than a commercial body."
for chunk in nlp(sentence).noun_chunks: print (len(chunk), chunk)
...
3 The Cleveland Chamber
1 Commerce
6 more a good-government organization
3 a commercial body
The third noun_chunk should have been just "a good-government organization"; "more" before it is extraneous and/or not part of it.
