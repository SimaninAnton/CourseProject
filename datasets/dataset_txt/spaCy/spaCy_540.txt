I trained a NER model and I found the recall has some minor issues.
Companies are usually only recognized when it has a "Inc" or "Co". "Apple Inc." works fine, but "Apple" is fairly inconsistent
There are struggles with last names. "Bob Smith" will do fine, but "Smith" is more of a hit or miss
Certain entities like "Company X" will be tagged and not tagged
My guess is that my data is more user comments, so it's not as uniform and structured as well as a news article. With a bit more randomness, what's the best way to approach it? I've already taken into considerationEntityRuler but it won't help cover cases I don't expect.
