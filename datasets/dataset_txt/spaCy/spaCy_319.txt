Hi,
I have a problem when loading the en_core_web_sm model. These are the steps I followed that lead to the error.
I installed spacy using
conda install -c conda-forge spacy
following instructions form here. And the en_core_web_sm model using:
conda install -c conda-forge spacy-model-en_core_web_sm
following the instructions here.
Then I import spacy and the en_core_web_sm model in Spyder (Python 3.6) with no issues:
import spacy
import en_core_web_sm
However, when I do either:
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
or
nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()
I got the following message:
"ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (96) into shape (128)"
I read issues #3113 and #3226, but they don't really resemble my problem. I can't find any other resources on the internet to help me solve this issue. Does anyone have any idea of how to fix this?
