A few questions regarding using word vectors for NER
1 - After training the word2vec model using Gensim, what are we saving to file how do we import the Gensim output to spacy when training an NER model? (using the train_ner.py script provided, are we supposed to use this spacy.load(vocabulary, vocab=nlp.vocab) where vocabulary is something like en_vectors_web_lg
2 - I'm using the same corpus of text for both steps - training the NER model and creating word2vec model. Is this the correct approach?
3 - When building the word2vec model should we preserve word shape? or make everything lowercase? Also should we remove numerics?
4- CBOW vs Skip Gram for NER?
