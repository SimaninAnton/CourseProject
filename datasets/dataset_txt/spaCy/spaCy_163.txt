This might not be the right place to state this question OR it might be.
I'm wondering if anyone have had any experience on deploying/managing their spaCy models in Google Cloud Platform? E.g. it might be possible to use their AI Platform and list spaCy as a dependency when packaging the model. However it isn't clear to me if its actually feasible so maybe someone already knows?
FYI; we are using spaCy on a stream of realtime news.
