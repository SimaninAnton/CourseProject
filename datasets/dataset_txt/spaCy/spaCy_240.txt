How to reproduce the behaviour
Writing to stdout (-) with spacy convert produces invalid characters.
Standard shell redirect cannot be used to create the output file since the JSON file is corrupted. I guess the "information" messages should be printed to stderr rather than stdout and this will fix the issue.
(venv) $ spacy convert -c iob -s -n 10 -l de sentences.iob - > bug.json
(venv) $ head bug.json
