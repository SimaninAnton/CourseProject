Created a custom spacy ner on new entities and saved model using nlp.to_disk() and tested it on my local machine by spacy.load ('path to model') which worked succesfully.
When i tried to share my model folder (contains pipeline named folders,meta.json and vocab) with others and throws error for others when they try to run spacy.load('path to model')
Can't find model custommodel
Note: We both are using same version of Spacy 2.1.8 and python 3.7.3
