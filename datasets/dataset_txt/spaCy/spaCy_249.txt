The output of the spacy.gold.docs_to_json format is inconsistent with the function description. The function says that it RETURNS (list): The data in spaCy's JSON format.. In reality, the function combines all the documents into one big json.
Either the description or the function itself needs to be adjusted. I think that it should do the later - because that would be in line with the input for the training functions. I am not sure how the ids should be handled.
