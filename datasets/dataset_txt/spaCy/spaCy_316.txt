Hi there,
I used spacy to load glove vectors as below --
glove_vectors = spacy.load('en', vectors='en_glove_cc_300_1m_vectors')
and then to obtain glove embeddings for phrases, as below --
concept = 'red and white'
embedding = glove_vectors(u'%s' %concept).vector
The embedding returned from above is a 300 dim vector. But I could not find out how multi word phrases are dealt under the hood. Could someone explain me this?
Thanks!
