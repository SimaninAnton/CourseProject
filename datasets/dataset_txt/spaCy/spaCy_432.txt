I am trying to add a new match to doc.ents but Spacy raises an error after executing span = Span(doc, start, end, label=match_id):
*** ValueError: [E084] Error assigning label ID 10305103465695748238 to span: not in StringStore.
I tried to add the string doc[start:end] to the vocab with nlp.vocab.strings.add(str(doc[start:end]) but first I get returned a different hash
1395163539440239885
and second I still get the same error. So it does seems that the match text is different from doc[start:end] (which is: "No fiebre").
This is extra weird as the same match was added yesterday without raising any errors
