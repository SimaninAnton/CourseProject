Given this code...
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world.")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
the result is
Apple PROPN nsubj
is AUX ROOT
one NUM attr
of ADP prep
the DET det
most ADV advmod
profitable ADJ amod
companies NOUN pobj
in ADP prep
the DET det
world NOUN pobj
. PUNCT punct
I would have expected the word is to be VERB ROOT as in
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple stands among the most profitable companies in the world.")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
Apple PROPN nsubj
stands VERB ROOT
among ADP prep
the DET det
