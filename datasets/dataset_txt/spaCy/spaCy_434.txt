This is not a bug or feature request per se, but I didn't post this question on Stackoverflow because it's not specifically about programming.
I have a set of data labeled for named entities. Some of these named entities overlap with the entity categories in the pre-trained English models, and some are new entity types.
While my dataset is labeled for named entities, it is not annotated for either DEP or POS because I do not have the resources to tag them exhaustively in my data.. Both DEP and POS are things I need for my work.
So my question is: Is it possible to train (finetune) on a pretrained model with a data set that is only labeled for NER and still retain the DEP and POS tagging? Thanks!
