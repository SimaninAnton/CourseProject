Hello, I tested spacy with two different version and the same text produce two different dependency and tags.
Your Environment
Operating System: windows 10
Python version: 3.6
First Test:
spacy version: 2.0.13
model: de_core_news_sm 2.0.0
environment: anaconda, jupyterNotebook
Second Test:
spacy version: 2.1.8
model: de_core_news_sm 2.1.0
environment: visualStudio, django
How to reproduce the behaviour
The text that I tested is "Das Auto muss gleich gelb sein"
And the first test result
second test result
As you can see the dep and tag from "gelb" and "muss" are different.
And when I change the word "gelb" to "blau" on the second test

The tag will change from VVPP into an ADJD.
I would like to know if it is a bug by the language model or something else, and what should I do to get the same result from older version in the newer version from Spacy? Because I have a function that are using the dependecy and POS-Tagging as parameter from the older version (first test)
Thank you
