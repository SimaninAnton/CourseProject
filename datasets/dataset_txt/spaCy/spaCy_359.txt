Hello all ,
I am currently working on a multi class text classification project. I have a set of .txt files for which I have created the equivalent vector representation using spaCy. I now want to create labelled data which will be my training data in order to train and create a model .
The training data should be vectors followed by the labels.
Can someone please direct me on how to get spaCy to accept vectors. The examples I have seen so far use text data followed by labels as the the training data . Are there any examples available that use vectors followed by labels as the training data .
Thank you !!
