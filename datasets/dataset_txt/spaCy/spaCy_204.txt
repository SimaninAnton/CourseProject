How to reproduce the behaviour
Attempting to append the default stop words list, but can't seem to add anything using either
more_stops = ['like', 'vet', 'veteran', 'Veterans']
STOP_WORDS.update(more_stops)
or
nlp.Defaults.stop_words |= {"like", "vet", "veteran", "Veterans"}
Neither command results in an error message, but when I go on to filter out stop words they remain in the dataset.
