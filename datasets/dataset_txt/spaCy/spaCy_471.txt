How to reproduce the behaviour
spaCy 2.0.12 didn't have span.ent as you claimed, it's a bit inconvenient because you have to go back to the doc object to match ents.
import spaCy nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md" doc = nlp('some random text. test sentences 2.') for sent in doc.sents: print(sent.ents)
