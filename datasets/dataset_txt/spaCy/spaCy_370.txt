Hi
I would like to calculate my custom entity extractor model's accuracy, precision etc. I found one solution where we need to provide the text and its start and end position in json form. its ok for couple of sentences, but for real data how to evaluate the model performance? ( I have trained the model on 3000 comments for 8 custom entities )
Please suggest
