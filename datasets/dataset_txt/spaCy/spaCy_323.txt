How to reproduce the behaviour
I'm trying to train the parser for polish. I'm using the PDB treebank, in the conllu format (because it contains one sentence per paragraph, I've used the option --n-sents=1 while converting). The results are close to 84% on UAS, somewhat weaker than what I would expect (having used different parsers before), so I'm not sure if I'm doing everything right. The treebanks do contain few percent of nonprojective trees, so I apply the gold preprocessing. When I try to evaluate the results using the conllu ud 18 eval script, I get the error about multiple roots in a sentence. Indeed few out of 2 thousand sentences are parsed to include two roots. From my understanding spaCy mistakenly treats these sentences as documents composed of two separate sentences (despite the lack of '.'). This is somewhat undesirable, as I've used someone elses models for polish, and they do not have this problem. Would you have any ideas regarding how to fix this?
