Hi
I have one use case where I want to extract ACTION (Update, Add, Remove etc.) and there are other Entities like Hire-Date, Trem-Date, Status etc. This is to be extracted from the Comments. e.g. "Please update hire date to 12/3/2017. Also add status as Active". I have approx 12000 such comments. I have just started working on it. My approach is...
I have taken 2500 random comments for training.
I have tokenize these comments and prepare a tsv file with Word and default Tag as "O".
Manually annotating each word by adding the entity under Tag replacing "O" like
Word Tag
Please O
update Action
hire O
date O
to O
12/3/2017 Hire-Date
then I am converting the tsv to json and json to spacy required format.
Creating a Blank en model, adding these new labels and updating the model.
My doubts are:
Is this the right approach?
Should I use all the 12000 comments for training?
this Annotating the entities, have to be done Manually?
How should I evaluate the model? which would give me Entity wise precision, recall, accuracy etc.
Environment
SpacY Version: 2.0
Python: 3.7
OS: Windows 10
Thanks!
