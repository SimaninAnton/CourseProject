Feature description
I decided to separate this from #4069 (see also #4063 ) since it's not quite the same issue.
With Matcher, it's very confusing that "bad" parts of patterns (e.g., with attributes that aren't supported) are silently discarded and end up matching every token rather than no token.
{'ASDF': True} shouldn't be equivalent to {}.
How slow is validation? Would it make sense to make validate=True the default? Are there simpler checks that could be added for when attributes are discarded that don't require full validation so that you could provide warnings or errors in these cases?
I think that less confusing default behavior would be:
{'ASDF': True} matches nothing
there are always warnings or errors when it is known that patterns will match nothing due to this kind of problem
