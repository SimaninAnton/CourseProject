terms = ["Barack Obama", "Angela Merkel", "Washington, D.C."]
doc = nlp("German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Barack Obama "
"converse in the Oval Office inside the White House in Washington, D.C.")
If I enter an extra space between the words "Barack Obama", the phrase matcher does not work since it is space sensitive.
Is there a way to overcome this space sensitive issue?
