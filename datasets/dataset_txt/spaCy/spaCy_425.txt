Not sure if this is an issue or not, but there are several files in the Norwegian (nb) lemmatizer directory that are basically empty. Here's an example - this is the whole file:
# coding: utf8
from __future__ import unicode_literals


NOUNS = set(
    """
""".split()
)
The NOUNS object is imported and used elsewhere so maybe it's a placeholder for something but this just seems pointless.
If this actually serves no purpose, I guess the files should be deleted. On the other hand, if it's there for a reason, it's probably best to add a comment explaining what that is.
