This is to demonstrate different dependencies when Proper Nouns are the Subject of the individual clauses of a compound sentence.
e.g He was born in New York and She lived in London

She      PRON          nsubj                  lived                     8

London   PROPN         pobj                   in                        9
Notice that the parent of "She" is the parent id 8 which is the correct viz. "lived"
However, change the sentence to: Tom was born in New York and Alice lived in London gives:
Token    Pos Tagger    Dependency Relation    Parent Token      Parent Id
-------  ------------  ---------------------  --------------  -----------
Tom      PROPN         nsubjpass              born                      2
was      VERB          auxpass                born                      2
born     VERB          ROOT                   born                      2
in       ADP           prep                   born                      2
New      PROPN         compound               York                      5
York     PROPN         pobj                   in                        3
and      CCONJ         cc                     York                      5
Alice    PROPN         conj                   York                      5
lived    VERB          advcl                  born                      2
in       ADP           prep                   lived                     8
London   PROPN         pobj                   in                        9
Now, the parent of Alice points to id 5 which is "York" instead of 8 which it should be. I found the same with the online Stanford Parser too. Any reason for this behaviour and is there a way out of this? Thanks
