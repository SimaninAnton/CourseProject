I have been googling for a while but I 've not found anything which was close to this question. I suppose that due to several internal changes or models characteristics/technology/approach there is no way to reuse our models which were trained on previous spaCy version (1.8.*). However, we would like to be sure just in case we could avoid to recompute all our models.
Thanks in advance!
