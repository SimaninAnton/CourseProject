Let's say that I take an existing model and I add a custom component that classifies spans. So, my custom component take as parameter the nlp object itself because I need it to make some preprocessing (again) in the span. Like this I could fall in an infinite loop. What is the best strategy to handle this kind of problem? (You can assume that I need features from the pipeline and cannot use just the make_doc)
A solution I found is to deep copy the nlp object. Is there a better strategy that I am not aware of?
