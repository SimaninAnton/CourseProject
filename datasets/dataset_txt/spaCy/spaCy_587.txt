It seems that this is not a bug, may be feature request.
I have an issue with usage Match to validate 'want' or 'would like' in phrase.
With single token I can just use 'ORTH' : {'IN': ['word1', 'word2']}, but in my case it's impossible because 'would like' is two tokens. I understand it.
Is there a possibility to describe somehow rule to validate my example.
