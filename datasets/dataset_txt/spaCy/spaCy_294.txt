IS_ALPHA reported as unsupported by Matcher, but it's still listed at https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/matcher/_schemas.py#L113
How to reproduce the behaviour
   matcher.add("RULE1", None, [{'IS_APLHA': True, 'IS_DIGIT': False, 'IS_PUNCT': False}, {}])

ValueError: [E152] The attribute IS_APLHA is not supported for token patterns. Please use the option validate=True with Matcher, PhraseMatcher, or EntityRuler for more details.
