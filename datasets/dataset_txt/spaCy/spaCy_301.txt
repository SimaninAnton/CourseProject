I wrote a Token Matcher to capture 'measures' in my corpus- eg a number followed by a unit like 5g. I want to expand it to capture proportions like 5g/mL but am receiving the error: cannot merge disjoint spans because 5g is already part of the tokens to merge. is it possible to use nested patterns?
