I have used Entity Rule to add new label for social security number. I even set overwrite_ents=true but it still does't recognize
I verified regular expression is correct. not sure what else I need to do I tried before="ner" but same result
text = "My name is ddex and I leave on 605 W Clinton Street. My social security 690-96-4032"
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
ruler = EntityRuler(nlp, overwrite_ents=True)
ruler.add_patterns([{"label": "SSN", "pattern": [{"TEXT": {"REGEX": r"\d{3}[^\w]\d{2}[^\w]\d{4}"}}]}])
nlp.add_pipe(ruler)
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents: print("{} {}".format(ent.text, ent.label_))
