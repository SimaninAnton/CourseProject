Feature description
As i understand from the documentation, we can match sentence using rules with adding patterns,
example :
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

doc = nlp(
    "i want to buy an iPhone X"
)
pattern = [{"TEXT": "iPhone"}, {"TEXT": "X"}]

matcher.add("Phone", None, pattern)
matches = matcher(doc)
print("Total matches found:", len(matches))

for match_id, start, end in matches:
    print("Match found:", doc[start:end].text)
the program will return :
Total matches found: 1
Match found: iPhone X
now we want to tag each token from the matched sentence:
we want a result as:
Phone Product: iPhone
Version: X
Phone Product and Version are two variables tags provided by the user
is there a way to achieve this result ?
