text = "Dumplings are delicious."
nlp.load("xxx")
doc = nlp(text)
-----------------
doc.cats = {
                "Shopping": {"score": 0.01},
                "Food": {"score":0.99, "child": {"Chinese Food": {"score": 0.99}, "British Cuisine": {"score": 0.01}}
            }
What I am doing:
Add multiple textcat pipelines first. (https://github.com/Astral1020/MultiLevelTextCategorizer)
Issue:
If I call spacy.load(), I got an exception:
KeyError: "[E002] Can't find factory for 'ROOT'. This usually happens when spaCy calls nlp.create_pipe with a component name that's not built in - for example, when constructing the pipeline from a model's meta.json. If you're using a custom component, you can write to Language.factories['ROOT'] or remove it from the model meta and add it via nlp.add_pipe instead."
