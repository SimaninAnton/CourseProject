Hi, I'm training my custom NER model with Spacy. Everything is OK, with the training and the model, but I have a problem: My dataset is partially labeled. So, say I have one only label. I want to weight this label in order to force model to predict it more usually although it sees examples where it's not labeled.
I don't know if I explained properly the problem... If someone has any idea I would really appreciate it!
Thanks!
