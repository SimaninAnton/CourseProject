I am referring to this part of documentation.
Does it takes into consideration the meaning of words while labeling dependencies.
I have multiple entities of same type in a sentence and I want to check their dependencies on some words to distinguish those entities.
For ex: Workshop starts at 9 am and ends at 10 pm.
Here 9 am , 10 pm are time entities.
How do I get to recognize 9 am as start_time and 10 pm as end_time.
How do I get my model to work even when starts is replaced with starting or strt (misspelled form) or begin.
How do i get my model to label correctly even if the positions are reversed, '
" Workshop ends at 10 am and starts at 9 am "
