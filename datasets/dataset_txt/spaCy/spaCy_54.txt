I am getting the following error when running a matcher on spacy.lang.en.English.
ValueError: [E155] The pipeline needs to include a tagger in order to use Matcher or PhraseMatcher with the attributes POS, TAG, or LEMMA. Try using nlp() instead of nlp.make_doc() or list(nlp.pipe()) instead of list(nlp.tokenizer.pipe()).
That puzzles me since Token.lemma_ does exist on the tokens, e.g. does the following yield True
nlp('Dec.')[0].lemma_ == 'December'
I am aware that you probably shouldn't be able to match on lemma but I think the above is still confusing. I assume lemma is replaced by norm, maybe?
