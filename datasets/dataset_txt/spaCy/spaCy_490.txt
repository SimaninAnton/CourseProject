Feature description
spacy.gold.biluo_tags_from_offsets should throw Error.E103 when the collection of entites passed in have overlapping tokens.
For example,
from spacy.gold import biluo_tags_from_offsets

doc = nlp(u"I like California Pizza Kitchen.")
entities = [(7, 17, "LOC"), (7, 31, "BRAND") ]
tags = biluo_tags_from_offsets(doc, entities) # should throw Error.E103
Right now tags is being assigned as ["O", "O", "U-LOC", "I-BRAND", "L-BRAND"], which violates the biluo tagging schema.
