I am aware of the https://prodi.gy/ tool for labeling named entities.
However, I have not found an existing tool for handling the dependency parser.
Is there an existing tool that would solve labeling dep_ and head tags through some kind of UI (like prodigy)?
If there is not, how would you recommend to go on with this problem?
