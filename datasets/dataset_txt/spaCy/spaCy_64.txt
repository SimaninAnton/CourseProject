Is there a way to write a rule based system to catch things like start/end dates from a contract text. Here are a few real examples. I am bolding the date entities which I want spacy to automatically detect. If you have other ideas different than spacy that is also OK!
The initial term of this Lease shall be for a period of Five (5) years commencing on
February 1, 2012, (the “Lease Commencement Date”) and expiring on January 31, 2017
(the “Initial Lease Term”).
Term: One (1) year commencing January 1, 2007 ("Commencement Date") and ending
December 31, 2007 ("Expiration Date").
This Lease Agreement is entered into for term of 15 years, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2028.
