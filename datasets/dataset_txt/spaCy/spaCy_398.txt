Hello, I'm using SpaCy to do some preprocessing in a dataflow pipeline (based on apache beam),
I installed SpaCy using the beam setup.py as a specific requirement,
When I launch the pipeline I got on "spacy.load('en')"
ValueError: spacy.syntax.nn_parser.Parser size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 72 from C header, got 64 from PyObject [while running 'ParDo(CollectQuestions)']
Is it a version issue, or just the dataflow environment?
I have already downgraded SpaCy, but no result, I have also tried to install with --no-binary option
