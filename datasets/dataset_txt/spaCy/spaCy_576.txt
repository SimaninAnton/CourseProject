I'm using Spacy NER to get organisation names from the text.
Example:
Text: AG Barr is recalling 750ml glass bottles due to a manufacturing fault which may cause bottle caps to pop off unexpectedly
Entities I want: AG Barr: ORG
Using "en_core_web_lg" as base model.
Accuracy using the base model is: 76%
From here I have filtered the incorrectly predicted sentence and created a test example of them to train new entity to improve overall accuracy. I have not created a blank model, using the "en_core_web_lg" as a base model.
After training a new entity using the new training sentence, my overall model accuracy got reduced to 60%.
