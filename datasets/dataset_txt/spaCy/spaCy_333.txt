It'd be help to have definitions of the annotation parameters in the "Training spaCyâ€™s Statistical Models" article (e.g., in the "Simple training style" and in the code in the "Updating Named Entity Recognizer" section).
For instance, in the code you have:
training data
TRAIN_DATA = [
("Who is Shaka Khan?", {"entities": [(7, 17, "PERSON")]}),
("I like London and Berlin.", {"entities": [(7, 13, "LOC"), (18, 24, "LOC")]}),
]
It'd be nice to specify the the parameters of the entity annotation are (start_pos, end_pos, entity_type). It took me a while to figure that out.
