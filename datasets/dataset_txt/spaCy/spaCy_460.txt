Is it possible to get a certainty score for each token or sentence? I want to use spaCy in my bachelor thesis about active learning for named entity recognition. My first approach would be active learning with uncertainty sampling, but therefore I need my model to support me an indication about how certain it is with its predictions.
It looks like prodigy also uses uncertainty sampling so I guess technically it should be possible for spaCy to support some kind of certainty score.
I couldn't find that kind of information in the official spaCy documentation.
Thank you for your great tool and any help!
