For the use case of Python development in an air gapped environment, it would be useful if the API documentation was accessible via the built-in Python help() system. For example, running help(spacy.tokens.Span) in the interpreter gives the following:
Help on class Span in module spacy.tokens.span:

class Span(builtins.object)
 |  A slice from a Doc object.
 |  
 |  DOCS: https://spacy.io/api/span
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __eq__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self==value.
 |  
...
The online API documentation at https://spacy.io/api/span contains additional information and a number of useful examples. However, if connectivity to https://spacy.io is not available then the information cannot be used. Placing the information in the class documentation would make it easier to include with the packaged module. It would also make access to it more consistent with other Python packages that use the help() system.
Alternatively, the package might deploy the HTML API documentation within the /share directory for virtual environments. This would be less ideal since it would be separate from the help() system, however it would help ensure it is included with local installations of the package.
