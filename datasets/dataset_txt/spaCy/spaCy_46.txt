I was annotating with Prodigy (ner.make-gold, 7 categories), and when wanted to validate the training dataset, got the following error:
That's a bit strange, as I haven't missed tokens and used labels from the list. Moreover, I have explicitly checked, and none of the labels in the annotated examples, contains the empty label (' ').
Is it possible to introduce an automated way to remove such empty labels in future releases? It will be very helpful.
Is there a simple solution to remove such labels from the data? Thanks.
