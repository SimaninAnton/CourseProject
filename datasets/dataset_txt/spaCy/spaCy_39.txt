I wanted to use the spacy entity linking model with the version spacy==2.0.11. I just want the NER from this model, not the linking. I am getting this error
KeyError: "[E002] Can't find factory for 'entity_linker'. This usually happens when spaCy calls nlp.create_pipe with a component name that's not built in - for example, when constructing the pipeline from a model's meta.json. If you're using a custom component, you can write to Language.factories['entity_linker'] or remove it from the model meta and add it via nlp.add_pipe instead."
Although I have used this entity linking model on a newer version of spacy but my deployment server is having some prodigy based model trained on older version.Is there a way I can use this with previous version?
