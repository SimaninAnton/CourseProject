This doesn't work. Also, there are many other cases where this does not work

'A placebo controlled observer blind immunocytochemical and histologic study of epithelium adjacent to anogenital warts in patients treated with systemic interferon alpha in combination with cryotherapy or cryotherapy alone OBJECTIVETo examine biopsy specimens of tissue immediately adjacent to anogenital AG warts which had been treated with either cryotherapy plus subcutaneous interferon IFN alpha 2a or cryotherapy alone, for histological features of a human papilloma virus HPV infection b localised cellular immune responses, to further characterise any cellular immune infiltrates with tissue immunocytochemistry, and to relate any histological, immunocytochemical findings to the treatment response of nearby AG wartsDESIGNA randomised placebo controlled observer blind studySETTINGGenitourinary Medicine clinic, Department of Immunopathology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, N IrelandSUBJECTSThirty patients with AG warts 16 treated with IFN alpha 2a plus cryotherapy, and 14 treated with cryotherapy aloneOUTCOME MEASURES1 Light microscopic features associated with HPV infection and local cellular immune responses 2 Indirect immunofluorescence detection of the following cell surface markers HLA DR, alpha one antitrypsin, CD1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD22 3 Clinical response of AG warts to treatmentRESULTSIn pretreatment biopsies only non specific indicators of HPV infection acanthosis, 2930 biopsies, and hyperkeratosis, 730 biopsies were seen on light microscopy Mononuclear cells were seen both throughout the upper dermis and centred around dermal blood vessels in 1930 633 biopsies, and infiltrating into the epidermis in 1230 40 biopsies On indirect immunofluorescence CD3, CD8, CD4 antigen was detected on the surface of cells throughout the upper dermis in 2429 827, 1529 517, and 329 103, of biopsy specimens respectively CD3 antigen, CD8 antigen and CD4 antigen was detected on the surface of cells infiltrating into the epidermis in 1829 62, 729 241, and 629 207 of biopsy specimens respectively CD1 antigen was seen on the surface of dendritic cells throughout the epidermis in all specimens CD1 positive cells infiltrated into the upper dermis in 529 172 HLA DR was detected on the surface of dendritic cells throughout the epidermis in 2229 759 of specimens, and on the surface of cells scattered both diffusely throughout the upper dermis and centred around dermal blood vessels in all specimens Alpha one antitrypsin A1AT antigen was seen on the surface of cells in the upper dermis in 629 207 of biopsy specimens no cells expressing CD22 surface antigen were seen The nature of this local cellular immune response was not altered by treatment of nearby warts with either cryotherapy alone or cryotherapy plus systemic IFN alpha 2a, or related to the therapeutic outcome of these wartsCONCLUSIONS1 No convincing histological evidence of HPV infection was seen in epithelium surrounding AG warts 2 A predominantly T cellmediated immune response the target of which is uncertain was seen in this perilesional epithelium 3 In the dosage regimens used in this study, treatment of AG warts with either systemic IFN alpha 2a plus cryotherapy or cryotherapy alone did not appear to augment localised cellular immune responses against any presumed subclinical HPV infection in epithelium surrounding AG warts'
