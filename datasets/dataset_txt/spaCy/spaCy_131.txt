I have trained a spacy ner model and using the trained model in console application to predict the entities.
When I run the application from IDE(PyCharm), it runs smoothly no error, properly loads the Spacy model predict the entities and all. But when I convert this application to executable file and try to run it. It throws me an error. I have attached screenshot of the error.
I believe that #2536 this issue is similar to mine. But not able to resolve it.
