Hello all,
I am looking to extend the croatian language model in spaCy with a look-up lemmatizer.
I found a great source of lemmas (over 100 000 lemmas in more than a million forms) here : http://meta-share.ffzg.hr/repository/browse/croatian-morphological-lexicon-v50/2d429672703d11e28a985ef2e4e6c59e27b37c59b92d42a5be839f7daff7ecfb/
I have already adaptet the lexicon into a lemmatizer and tested it out locally. It seems to work well.
The issue I`m having with submitting this lemmatizer to the spaCy codebase is the lexicons licence:
The lexicon is licensed under CC BY NC SA licence and spaCy is released under an MIT licence.
TL;DR; Is it okay to adapt the Croatian morphological lexicon into a lemmatizer given the different licenses that the two projects use?
