I have installed spacy and downloaded en_core_web_sm with:
pip3 install spacy
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
When running codes on Python3 default IDLE, it runs successfully:
import spacy
spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
However, when I run above codes in jupyter notebook, it shows error:
OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en_core_web_sm'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
I tried several ways in Jupyter notebook like
!python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
but it still shows the error.
OS: MacOS
Could somebody help me fix this issue? Thanks in advance!
