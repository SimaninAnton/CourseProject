Hi
I have a very small number of requests incoming on my server and yet the flask server always ends up getting stuck/hanging indefinitely.
I tracked down the problem to : the allowed number of files that the server opens reaches ulimit.
The flask server creates sockets one after the other and I don't know why it doesn't close them. I am not doing anything crazy, just rendering a page or putting a number in a mongo database
Any thoughts ?

(I don't know how issues work on github, first timer here ; I don't mind copying the full issue here if you prefer)
Thanks
