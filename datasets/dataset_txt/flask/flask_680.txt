Not a bug report, per se, but still should be noted. On the Security Considerations page, after describing the XSS remediation that Jinja2 provides, it describes the one caveat that unquoted html attributes are still vulnerable. It follows with a "correct" example:
<a href="{{ href }}">the text</a>
However that example is also vulnerable to XSS. An attacker could still set href to javascript:alert(1) to inject javascript into the tag (although it would require a user to click the link).
Perhaps the example should use a different quoted attribute as the example, like a default value for an input field or something of the like.
