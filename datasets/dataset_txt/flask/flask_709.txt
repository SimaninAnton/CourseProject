I have an HTML template that works correctly and downloads a file when open it directly in the browser (Chrome or Firefox), but the window.open command does not run (does not download the file) when the HTML is called from flask.
<script> window.open("file:///C:/mypath/mywordfile.docx") </script>
see attached sample
