First, the link to the docs on the main page:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/
is missing the links on the left for downloading the docs. It should be:
http://flask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
Second, the download links on the left are dead ends:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.[epub,pdf,mobi,zip]
should be:
http://readthedocs.org/projects/flask/downloads/[pdf,epub,htmlzip]/latest/
Same thing for the docs download links on the main page under the heading "Interested?"
