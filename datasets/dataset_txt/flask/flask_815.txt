I'm using the latest version of Flask (0.11.1) and the built in dev server, with the following Blueprint:
blueprint = Blueprint("admin", __name__, url_prefix="/admin", template_folder="templates", static_folder="static")
The template folder is working as expected, but any resources inside the static folder throw a RuntimeError: Attempted implicit sequence conversion but the response object is in direct passthrough mode.
After searching around for this error, I found the following discussion:
closeio/Flask-gzip#7
The solution used in that third party extension was to put in place the following code on app.after_request:
response.direct_passthrough = False
My static content loads fine with the above.
I was wondering if anyone has run into this issue with Blueprints and if there is a better workaround.
