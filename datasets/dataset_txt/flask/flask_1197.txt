I am curious why there isn't an after_response function, in the spirit of after_request. There are often tasks that can take a while and don't need to be 100% reliable, such as writing statistics to a data store, or hitting a third party API, and don't affect the response object. It'd therefore be nice to be able to do this work after the response object has been sent to the user, with an after_response function. This could be done with a task queue, but for a lot of projects this vastly increases complexity.
