When calling jsonify with the padded argument as True the expected behavior is padded JSON response that uses the callback argument. Example
handleResponse({"foo": "bar"})
However when setting padded to False the result is still a padded JSON response with the name of the callback function set to jsonp. Example
jsonp({"foo": "bar"})
Should be
{"foo": "bar"}
