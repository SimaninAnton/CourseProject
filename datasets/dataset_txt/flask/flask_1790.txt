The new signature for flash() should look like this in 0.5:
def flash(message, category='message'):
    ...
The method to fetch messages then will also accept a parameter that allows pulling as tuples with the category as well:
def get_flashed_messages(with_categories=False):
    ...
If invoked with that parameter set to False (which is the default) just the strings are returned, otherwise tuples in the form (category, message).
