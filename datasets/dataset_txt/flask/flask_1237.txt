There is mod_xsendfile which in it's current beta version supports X-Sendfile-Temporary which is like X-Sendfile but removes the file afterwards.
Is there some chance of supporting this? If not (because it's beta and not supported by other servers yet), what would be the recommended way to implement this myself? Of course I can just send the header, but I'm not sure if that's enough, judging by the length of send_file().
