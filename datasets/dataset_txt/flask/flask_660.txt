(Observed on Python 2.7; untested on 3.x)
Steps to reproduce:
echo "import thisisnotarealpackage" > error_app.py
export FLASK_APP=error_app.py
flask run
Expected result:
Some indication that thisisnotarealpackage is not a real package
Observed result:
Usage: python -m flask run [OPTIONS]

Error: The file/path provided (error) does not appear to exist.
Please verify the path is correct.
If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py

This has been causing some confusion on my team because cx_Oracle can fail to import (from the bowels of SQLAlchemy) if it can't find certain Oracle support files on the host machine.
