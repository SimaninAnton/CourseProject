I'd suggest enhancing the url_for function to accept callables as well, i.e. the function name unquoted; as this would help e.g. with code refactoring tools and auto completion.
It can easily be implemented with a few lines; if such a functionality would be desirable, I can prepare a PR with tests, etc.
