I have 2 RHEL 6 unix servers. There are slight differences in between the versioning listed below. One server is already set-up and it is working well following the steps from the above link to configure logging integrated with gunicorn log file. However, when i followed the same approach to configure in a newer versions environment, those app.logger.info() message did not log to the gunicorn log file. I suspect it may be due to the change in 0.12 release. Any idea?
Version 0.12
Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.
...
Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
