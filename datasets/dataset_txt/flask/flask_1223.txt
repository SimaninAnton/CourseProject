I'm writing a website using Flask (I love it) in which I use a lot of decimals. This however, presents me with a problem when wanting to jsonify dicts or lists containing Decimals (which happens a lot in my website).
In this stackoverflow answer there is a suggestion to overcome this with the basic json.dumps() method:
def decimal_default(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):
        return float(obj)
    raise TypeError

json.dumps({'x': decimal.Decimal('5.5')}, default=decimal_default)
I wouldn't know how to use this way of doing it with the flask builtin jsonify though. Does anybody know how I can make jsonify also convert Decimals correctly? All tips are welcome!
