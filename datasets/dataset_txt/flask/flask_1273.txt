It would be useful to be able to refer to flash categories using constants, for example:
FLASH_CATEGORY_MESSAGE = 'message'
FLASH_CATEGORY_DEFAULT = FLASH_CATEGORY_MESSAGE
This gives an overview of the already defined categories, and an obvious way to avoid duplicating these in every Flask application.
