There's a new RFC for preventing CSRF by restricting cookies to same-site only (i.e. no 3rd party cookies).
At least Chrome seems to support it since the developer tools list it if you look at cookies.
Adding support for it in Flask should be pretty simple. (Add an attribute to Set-Cookie when setting the session cookie and a configuration option to configure this.)
