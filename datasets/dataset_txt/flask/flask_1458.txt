Hello
First, sorry for my english.
I have problem. I need HTTP_REFERER, like php to hotlinks protection.
in request.headers i have
Content-Length:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Connection: keep-alive
Host: dbooks.local:8080
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8
Accept-Language: pl,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Content-Type:
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
But i don't have HTTP_REFERER.
What i can do with this?
