Apparently there's been some changes in the way the docs are generated on RTD.
I see there's a rtd branch with a commit (86acd84) dedicated to RTD adding docs/requirements.txt.
The build on this branch passes but there's that warning on top of the page:
Warning: This is an old version. The latest stable version is Version 1.0.2..
The other builds (1.0.2 and master) fail: https://readthedocs.org/projects/flask/builds/.
I suppose the config was change in RTD to look for that requirements.txt file that only appears in rtd branch.
As a user, I don't mind the warning, but I'm building a documentation for a lib using Flask with this intersphinx mapping:
intersphinx_mapping = {
    'flask': ('http://flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/', None),
}
I get an error due to the failed build as http://flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/objects.inv is not fetchable.
Should I use https://flask.readthedocs.io/en/rtd/objects.inv or is this temporary?
Thanks.
