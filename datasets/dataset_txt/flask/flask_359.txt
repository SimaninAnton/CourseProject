I have already done some coding and get app with 3 lang urls but it may not be clear
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49496761/two-language-flask-site-with-or-without-blueprints/49948870#49948870
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/deferredcallbacks/
documentation for this is not clear too
Can anyone put the full example for international URLs in documentation ? and also using it in jinja and switching between languages and also using it without Babel
