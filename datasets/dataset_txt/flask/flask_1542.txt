i can't get a charset in json responses with my Flask app
running wsgi under apache.
for static json files outside of my Flask app with httpd.conf:
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
AddType 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' .json
i get the proper response:
Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
but in my Flask app i still get only:
Content-Type:application/json
is there a way to fix this without moving my json files outside
of my app, or creating a view just for them? that would be silly,
wouldn't it?
