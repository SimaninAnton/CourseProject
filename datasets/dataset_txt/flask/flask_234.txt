Hi
I have form(Form) which contains
<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="{{ url_for('xxx') }}">
  <input type="file" name="MultipleFileUpload" multiple="">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}" />     
  <input type="submit" value="add">
</form>
It should upload multiple files but it does not.
Python code
ob = request.files.getlist("MultipleFileUpload[]")
for x in ob:
     etc..
This was my old code which works perfectly
I presume it was caused by update
so I change it code to:
ob = request.files.getlist("MultipleFileUpload")
ob = request.files.to_dict()
None of them works
It just upload 1 file or none
