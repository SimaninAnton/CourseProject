I think that flask needs some sort of dedicated channel to announce critical updates (or in general, new versions).
The reason is that flask grew to a point where there is a lot of activity on the repository and the general mailing list. Listening on the mailing list or "watching" the repository for maintenance-only projects in order to catch new critical updates means siphoning through a lot of messages.
Would setting up something like a separate announce list be possible?
