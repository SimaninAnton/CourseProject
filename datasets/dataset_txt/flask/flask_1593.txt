Upon initially reading the url_for function documentation I assumed that if I provided an endpoint matched to a URL rule with substitution tokens without specifying substitution values, it would return the base rule. Having debugged my problem and re-read the url_for documentation closely, I realized that you tried to express this, it just isn't very 'tard friendly.
