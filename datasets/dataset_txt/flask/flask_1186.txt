I was experimenting with making a clean build of a project of mine that includes flask 0.10.1. I was going to run git clean -fdx to get a pristine clean environment to build from, but it crashes:
thiderman@dragonisle ~/git/piper venv:piper(master:+6) 
> git clean -fdx -n 
Would remove .coverage
Would remove .tox/
Would remove argparse-1.2.1-py2.6.egg
Would remove bin/
fatal: Not a git repository: /Users/mitsuhiko/Development/flask/.git/modules/docs/_themes
If I remove docs/_themes/.git it works. git autodetects it and thinks that it's a submodule, and since my computer is not @mitsuhiko's Mac machine it kinda fails. :P
Could this file be excluded from the tarball? I can't really see that it serves a purpose, and it breaks my project in an unexpected way.
