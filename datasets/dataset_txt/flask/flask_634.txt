I'm doing some work which requires defining some context hooks for our flask app. When reading the documentation for request contexts* I came across the passage:
In production mode if an exception is not caught, the 500 internal server handler is called. In development mode however...
As a user, I want to know: What is 'development mode?' I think it's debug mode (e.g. app.run(debug=True)). I've seen several people use the terms interchangeably when searching for help, but not either the flask developers or the official documentation. The flask docs don't appear to have an index (is it hidden somewhere?), and quick search does not appear to work. Google site search of the dev docs does not immediately turn up an obvious answer.
IMO, this is a bug in the documentation. Assuming for the sake of argument I'm right about dev=debug, that passage should be either:
"In development mode (i.e. with debug=True) however..." or
The text 'development mode' is a link to a list of terms & their definitions
Something along those lines.
Maybe if I had carefully read all of the docs from beginning to end, or at least carefully read the tutorial twice, I might not be confused about this. But lots of your users won't do that. That's why I call it a bug (it's sorta like failing to validate input).
*I was in fact reading the docs for the version of flask I'm using, but pointing to dev-version docs b/c I presume they represent the current state of the documentation
