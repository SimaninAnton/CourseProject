Expected Behavior
Should use clear language and variable names.
Example: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/0.12.x/patterns/celery/
Actual Behavior
Use the variable celery instead of something like celery_app. Also imports Celery from celery package.
I would rename the variable celery to celery_app or just app. app makes more sense because it is what is used in Celery documentation.
If you want to make this change, I am all ears. I would love to send the PR.
