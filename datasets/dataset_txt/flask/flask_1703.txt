The example last in this section is pointless because the recorded list is never yielded and it is not reachable from anywhere. connected_to yields None.
def captured_templates(app):
    recorded = []
    def record(template, context):
        recorded.append((template, context))
    return template_rendered.connected_to(record, app)
It's still a meaningful pattern for like what Flask-Testing does, appending to self.templates which in deed is reachable from tests. What would be a sensible rewrite?
