I think the changes introduced in fa6eded that swallow ALL exceptions if loading a custom CLI command fails are not good for the general development flow. I often do flask --help to see whether my custom command comes up fine and when it doesn't I don't get exceptions and I don't really know what I've done wrong.
I think this try-except should be removed. I really think the CLI should fail loudly instead of ignoring errors. Let's discuss this and if you guys agree I'll make a PR.
