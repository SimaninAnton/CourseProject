Over the past 2 months I've sent 3 questions to the mailing flask@librelist.com mailing list. It had worked for me before, The questions have been completely ignored, and they don't even appear in the archive.
I've sent another question earlier, in mid December 2014, and it was archived and responded to. The 3 questions since then have not.
