The config logic of flask is potentially useful for any other long running python server software.
I extracted it, extended is and started using it for my own projects : https://github.com/asmodehn/pyros-config.
It would be good if there was a dedicated (pallets) project for that part, not only in flask, so other could collaborate on it.
Thoughts ?
