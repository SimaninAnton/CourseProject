I have this route
@app.@app.route(/resource/<string:myresource>/details')
def handler(myresource):
  ....
  ...
When I have a leading backslash in the name, it doesn't seem to be getting routed correctly.
This works:
 /resource/testresource/details/
This does not work:
 /resource/%5Ctestresource/details
Is this expected? What am I doing wrong?
