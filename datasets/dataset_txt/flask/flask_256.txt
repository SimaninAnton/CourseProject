I am running flask dev server using the flask command. If an exception is thrown (such as syntax error) and then fixed. The next reload fails with some sort of issues having to due with attempting to reinitialize extensions. For example I get the following error from flask-admin (though depending on order of imports I get similar errors from other extensions):
AssertionError: A name collision occurred between blueprints <flask.blueprints.Blueprint object at 0x1118b96d8> and <flask.blueprints.Blueprint object at 0x1042880b8>. Both share the same name "admin". Blueprints that are created on the fly need unique names.
I don't think this is the same issue as #2423 as I can trigger the problem with non syntax error (ie a name error a module scope).
Environment
Python version:
3.7
Flask version:
flask==1.0.2
Werkzeug version:
werkzeug==0.14.1
