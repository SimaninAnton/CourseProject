A GET request is allowed for any route, even when it is not in the listed methods. The result is a 404 for the GET request.
For example:
@module.route('/foo', methods=["PUT"])
def foo():
    return Response(status=204)
Here's the result of an OPTIONS request with the incorrect additional GET in the Allow header:
$ curl -IX OPTIONS http://localhost:5000/foo

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Allow: PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, GET
Content-Length: 0
