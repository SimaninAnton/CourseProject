Use inspect to check if the factory takes an argument before passing the script info instance to it.
Preferably pass the info as a keyword instead of positional argument, so that the developer could do something like def create_app(config=None, script_info=None). Still check if the function takes a script_info argument before passing it.
Alternatively (or additionally), show how to pass arguments to the factory through the info. I think this can be done by overriding run, adding an option like --config, and setting info.data['config'] before invoking the built-in run command.
