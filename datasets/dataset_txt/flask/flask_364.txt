Hi,
I follow readme in tutorial.
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
But i got
Error: Failed to find application in module "flaskr". Are you sure it contains a Flask application? Maybe you wrapped it in a WSGI middleware or you are using a factory function.
I try to read many fixed issues about that and follow carefully http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/ but :(
