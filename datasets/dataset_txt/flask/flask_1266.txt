Hi,
I have a blueprint defined as :
auth_login = Blueprint('auth_login', name, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static', static_url_path='/static')
I am registering it as :
app.register_blueprint(auth_login, url_prefix='/user')
I have a route:
@auth_login.route('//')
def profile(username):
return render_template('profile/user.html',
username = username)
With this setup, the /user/ endpoint never manages to load the static files as I get,
"GET /user//static/css/lib/bootstrap.min.css HTTP/1.1" 404 -
"GET /user//static/css/lib/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css HTTP/1.1" 404 -
What I really want is to look into the static folder of the root application and not the blueprint, so I want it to request
"GET /static/css/lib/bootstrap.min.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
Is it possible to configure this via static_folder or static_url_path so that the route will look for the static files at root and not relative to where the blueprint is mounted?
