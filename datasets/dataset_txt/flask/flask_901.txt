Commonly i do a check similar to
if request.path != url_for('auth.index'):
The issue with this on Python3.5 right now is that request.path is unicode while url_for is a string.
print(request.path, url_for('auth.index'))
>>> (u'/auth/', '/auth/')
Is this intended or is there a reason for it? Could we not have both return unicode?
