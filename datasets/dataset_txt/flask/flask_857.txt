I use send_file() function for serving file-like objects from GridFS. However, if the file-like object obtained from the GridFS has assigned a file name, the send_file() function tries to get the file from the file system and I get a "File not found"-like error. It should serve the data from the file-like object directly and not to try to find the file on the file system (even when there is a file name assigned to the file-like object). Or am I missing something?
