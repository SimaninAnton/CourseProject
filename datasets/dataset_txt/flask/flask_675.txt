The help about flask.request http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#incoming-request-data just includes a simple: "args: A MultiDict with the parsed contents of the query string. (The part in the URL after the question mark).", Thus nothing about how args are generated.
I need to pass a complex string (with spaces and other url characters).
I found from some experiments, ithat I can generate on client side the query string with urllib.parse.quote(query1, safe=''), and this query parameter will be unquoted correctly by flask (request.args).
Because there are many quoting convention (e.g. space replaced with '+', it would be nice to have some more info on the documentation about quoting method, and possibly to have the quote and unquote also directly as flask utilities (like the json support), ready to be used client side.
Possibly also the path decoding could have similar problem (in that case with the default 'safe' argument).
