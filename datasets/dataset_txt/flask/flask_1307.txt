It is kind of understandable if Flask is deliberately not sending the Debug Page when it is serving through WSGI, even if app.debug = True, because Flask doesn't want the user to show that page in production by mistake. It is probably a security feature for the greater good. However, this means, Flask assumes that when the user is deploying it using WSGI, it is in production mode. Which may or may not be true. However, we can accept it for the sake of security.
That being said, the part that does not make sense is that it is not sending any data to WSGI in this situation. The least it could do is to send the 500 error page that it would have sent by default, if app.debug was False. Seeing an empty reply doesn't instinctively make sense.
I have setup a simple test to demonstrate the problem over here: https://github.com/recognosco/flask-uwsgi-error
