In our Flask web application we are facing 'CSRF Session Token is missing' only when morning first request. we have used the default session, csrf configuration not changed anything. cookie secret key only given.
We are using Nginx as our load balancer. We debugged the problem, For our HTML page Rquest cookies don't send 'session cookie', So we are Receiving session cookie in 'Response Cookies'
The logic here used is if we not send session cookie, server returns session cookie in response as per our understanding.
So can anyone help why there is session cookie not received in response for first time of a day in a HTML page or is that cookie expired and due to that we are facing this problem?(Note: we are not using any cookie expiration time using default value)
Environment
