Expected Behavior
On documentation e.g. http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/config/#ENV when I
press changelog button will show some information.
Actual Behavior
When I press changelog button doesn't show any news. This is working on unstable
documentation, but will be great if that is working on stable documentation too.
Environment
Flask version: 1.0
Documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/config/#ENV
