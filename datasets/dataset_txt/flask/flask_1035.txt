The Flask documentation for how to use it with uWSGI and nginx is incorrect. As the uWSGI docs say at http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Nginx.html#hosting-multiple-apps-in-the-same-process-aka-managing-script-name-and-path-info, "ancient uWSGI versions used to support the so called “uwsgi_modifier1 30” approach. Do not do it. it is a really ugly hack". The documentation should be updated to talk about the manage-script-name and mount options instead.
