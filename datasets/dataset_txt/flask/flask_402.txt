Just a typo here with the fileuploads guide I guess?
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fileuploads/
Expected Behavior
When running the code from the quickstart guide for fileuploads the return statement should call 'upload_file' and not 'uploaded_file'
Actual Behavior
The following error and recommendation is returned:
 raise BuildError(endpoint, values, method, self)
werkzeug.routing.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'uploaded_file' with values ['filename']. Did you mean 'upload_file' instead?
Environment
Python version: 3.5.1
Flask version: 0.12.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
