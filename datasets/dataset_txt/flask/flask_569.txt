Step 3 of the tutorial (installing flaskr as a package) needs rationale at the top. As it stands, that section of the tutorial tells the user out of the blue that they should install their webapp as a package, but doesn't say why. The user can already run their webapp via flask run, so it's not clear why they should at this point set up and install their package into their venv.
