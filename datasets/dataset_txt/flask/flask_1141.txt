Hi !
I'm in trouble since a moment using Flask with that point.
I'm registring 2 url rules in a blueprint :
class MyClass(Blueprint):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_url_rule('<service>.<ext>', view_func=service_call)
        self.add_url_rule('networks.<ext>', view_func=networks)
I've read somewhere that the rule with the less number of parameters is taken in routing.
But, when I'm typing /networks.json, I'm in the service_call() function, not in networks()
When I print the url_map :
Map([ <Rule '/v1/<service>.<ext>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> v1.service_call>,
 <Rule '/v1/networks.<ext>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> v1.networks>,
 <Rule '/static/<filename>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> static>])
After some tests, it seems that following code is working as expected :
class MyClass(Blueprint):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_url_rule('<service>/<ext>', view_func=service_call)
        self.add_url_rule('networks/<ext>', view_func=networks)
So, the dot isn't considered as a "separator" ?
Is there a way to fix that ?
Thanks in advance for your help !
