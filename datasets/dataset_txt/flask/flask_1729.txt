Not really a bug, but something worth mentioning in the documentation
the structure of the application is usually
application/init.py : creation of the app, registration of the modules
but then the modules don't have access to the "app" (cannot do 'from application import app')
how can we structure the app to have access to some global variables in all modules, etc?
if the app is only one module, it's okay because we already have the app, but if we're registering modules, they don't necessarily have access to the app
