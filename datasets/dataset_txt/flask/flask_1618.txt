I'd like to use Flask over pure Werkzeug but I don't need templating. It's fine for Jinja2 to be required to be installed since Flask extensions might expect it, but would it be possible (and worth it) for Flask to take an option to tell it not to bother setting up a default Jinja environment for the app since I won't be using it?
