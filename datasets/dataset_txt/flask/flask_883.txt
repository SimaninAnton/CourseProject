Hi, I was following the tutorial on Flask at this.
And I tried to return json data so I use jsonify
I found out that jsonify use dict() to convert params into a dict. But this will remove items with duplicate key.
In my case, I querried the data using this query
cur = g.db.execute('SELECT title, text from entries order by id desc')
The data was:
[(u'Nope', u'hi, this is anoooother things'), (u'Nope', u'This is another'), (u'Hi', u'This is a sample entry')]
So the jsonify just return:
{ "Hi": "This is a sample entry", "Nope": "This is another" }
The code work correctly, but I don't know if this is intended or not?
