Hey guys,
I am trying to achieve a automatic redirect to the '/' node on either timeout or if a variable is set to a specific value. And this should work from all pages. So it doesnt matter on which site the user is, the automatic logout will trigger.
I thought something like
while redirect = False:
do routing and stuff
at some point redirect = True
redirect(url_for('index'))
Any ideas? If the while thing is posible, how can I wrap the whole application? There has to be a better solution
