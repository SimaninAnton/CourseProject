Overriding a blueprint's template does not take effect without restarting the development server.
Follow these steps to reproduce:
First, add and register the following blueprint without creating any templates. It should produce a "Template Not Found" error:
from flask import Blueprint, render_template

blueprint = Blueprint(
    'blueprint', 
    __name__, 
    template_folder='blueprint/templates')

@blueprint.route('/testoverride')
def TestOverride():
    return render_template('test.html')
Next, add a new template called "test.html" under the blueprint's template directory and refresh the page. It should find the template without restarting the server.
Now add a second template having the same filename but different content under the application's template directory and refresh the page. The page's content will not change without restarting the server.
Restart the server and refresh the page. Confirm the content has now changed.
