SetUp
VirtualBox | Ubuntu Server 12.04.2
(flaskve)vks@UbSrVb:~/flaskve$ python --version
Python 2.7.3
ifconfig
192.168.1.100 (the bridge interface on which i interact with VirtualBox)
code I am trying to run.
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='192.168.1.100', port=8080, debug=True)
When I do
(flaskve)vks@UbSrVb:~/flaskve$ python start.py 
(flaskve)vks@UbSrVb:~/flaskve$
It does not run or do anything, it just returns back to command prompt. Although I am running in debug=True mode.
I then made a new VirtualEnv and install bottle in that. When I tried to run helloworld it shows the same behaviour.
However I then started the python shell on the same virtualenv, imported bottle modules and ran
>>> from bottle import route, run
>>> run(host='192.168.1.100', port=8081, debug=True)
Bottle v0.11.6 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://192.168.1.100:8081/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.  
What could be problem here ?
Even debug does not show anything.
Following link is the output of python -v start.py
