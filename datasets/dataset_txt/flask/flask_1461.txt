I think that it would be useful to be able to add configuration items to a blueprint and then have those merged into the app configuration on load. My thinking is simply that there might be configurations specific to your blueprint that should have default values stored as part of the blueprint. I suppose this feature could also lead to use cases where people make blueprint simply to hold different configuration for the application.
