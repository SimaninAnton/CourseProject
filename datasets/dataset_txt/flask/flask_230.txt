Expected Behavior
Using templates should provide some protection against Cross-Site Scripting, based on the information at http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/security/
Flask configures Jinja2 to automatically escape all values unless explicitly told otherwise. This should rule out all XSS problems caused in templates...
Actual Behavior
I'm able to inject code into the page.
Demo: https://github.com/afd3dea/example1
http://127.0.0.1/?m=<script>alert(1);</script> executes (assuming XSS Auditor / AV doesn't block it)
Environment
Python version: Python 3.6.7
Flask version: Tried on 0.12.1 and 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: ?
