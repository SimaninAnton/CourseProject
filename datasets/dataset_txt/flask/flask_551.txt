Hi all,
I am building a chatbot. There are few child templates like login.html, messages.html, transaction.html, etc. I want to append these templates in base.html. I am extending base.html in all these templates. My problem is only one template is rendered at a time. Is there any solution for appending these templates one after another? I have used {%include%} but it's a static approach. I need dynamic.
printer.py looks like -
@app.route('/respond', methods=['GET','POST'])
def respond_def():
message = request.form['message_input']
if message == "l":
return render_template('printer/login.html')
elif message == "t":
return render_template('printer/transactionID.html')
base.html looks like -
//some code here
{% block template %}{% endblock %}
//some code here
message.html looks like -
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block template %}
Message template called
{% endblock %}
