I just realized that the headline "And easy to setup" might trick the user into thinking that's all it takes to setup a Flask app on the production server.
Of course the exact opposite is stated in the quickstart, but then we never can expect people to actually read documentation.
Independent of whether this is really an issue anybody else but me sees, i think a large "Get Started" button on the front page might animate people to read the docs from the beginning.
