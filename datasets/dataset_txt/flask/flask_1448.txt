I found two pages on the documentation with a problem on a import explanation
from flaskext.mail import Mail
And the correct should be (with a dot between flask and ext):
from flask.ext.mail import Mail
The pages with this wrong import are: http://packages.python.org/flask-mail/ and http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/85/
