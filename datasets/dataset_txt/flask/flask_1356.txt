Installation
Flask depends on two external libraries, Werkzeug and Jinja2. Werkzeug is a toolkit for WSGI, the standard Python interface between web applications and a variety of servers for both development and deployment. Jinja2 renders templates.
So how do you get all that on your computer quickly? There are many ways you could do that, but the most kick-ass method is virtualenv, so let's have a look at that first.
You will need Python 2.6 or higher to get started, so be sure to have an up-to-date Python 2.x installation. For using Flask with Python 3 have a look at :ref:python3-support.
:ref:python3-support should be :ref:python3_support.
