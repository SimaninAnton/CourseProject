With Flask 0.9 and Werkzeug 0.8.3 I was able to test many of our functions by creating a SecureCookie with
from werkzeug.contrib.securecookie import SecureCookie
session = SecureCookie(dict(uid=uid), app.secret_key).serialize()
But that now gives me an empty session when we get to the request function, even though
    SecureCookie.unserialize(request.cookies['session'], app.config['SECRET_KEY'])
gives the correct dict that was passed through.
I tried to figure it out from the source, but couldn't quite get the gist of it.
