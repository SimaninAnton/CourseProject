If I run a server in debug mode and the kill the parent process the child process is left running. It should be killed along with the parent (as usually happens with parent-child processes).
import flask
app = flask.Flask(__name__)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
> ps -ef | grep python
edA-qa   18280 16524  4 15:38 pts/7    00:00:00 python min.py
edA-qa   18285 18280  4 15:38 pts/7    00:00:00 /usr/bin/python min.py
> kill 18280
> ps -ef | grep python

This is interfering with my ability to use Flask as a test server in a test suite. I spawn a process with Popen and kill it when I'm done. Unfortunately the server is left and only a wrapper process is killed.
