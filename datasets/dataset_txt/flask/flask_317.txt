Citing from issue #1575:
The biggest one is to somehow make it clear why the flask executable is recommended over app.run() for local development and to gently guide this through from the documentation. ( #1575 (comment))
Looking through http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/ I cannot see any explanation in this regard. I also don't understand why the name of the app must be exported as environment variable and cannot simply be an argument to the flask command. Without an explanation that seems very cumbersome to me. And what is the recommendation on how to run a flask app not for local development?
