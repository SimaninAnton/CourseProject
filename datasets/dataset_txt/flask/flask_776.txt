It would be great to support RFC 7233 : Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests for next major version, at least for non multipart/byteranges media type.
I'm willing to implement this, so please share your thoughts about this.
What must be done:
Modify send_file method to support Range Requests
Use existing conditionnal parameter to enable Range Requests support ?
