It looks like deep down, Flask calls SocketServer.py (a source code file for Python) to make its server. But SocketServer.py has a call to os.fork(), which isn't supported at all on Windows. It would be great to use something besides SocketServer, or maybe a modified version of SocketServer. When you make a HTTP request, it first calls SocketServer.process_request, which then calls os.fork.
More importantly (to me at least), does anyone have a workaround?
