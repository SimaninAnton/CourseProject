I have a website with acces by more subdomain like :
'www.mysite.com', 'category1.mysite.com', 'category2.mysite.com', ...
whose point to one blueprint.
It's interesting to manage more one subdomain by blueprint, for example by a list :
landing_bp = Blueprint('landing', name, subdomain=['www','category1','category2'], url_prefix='/landing')
Or disable subdomain.
Thank's you.
