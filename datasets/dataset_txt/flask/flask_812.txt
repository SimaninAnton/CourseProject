Because Click was added to Flask 0.11 for the New Command Line Interface, and Click imports the Windows only module msvcrt, and the Google App Engine local development server doesn't contain this module, an import error is thrown.
I've created a workaround for the gae-init project (by modifying the App Engine config file), but it would be best to have a fix come directly from Flask/Click since there are likely many more people who will experience this issue when using Flask 0.11 with Google App Engine.
