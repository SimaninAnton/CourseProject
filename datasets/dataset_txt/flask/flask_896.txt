I need to run several flask apps at the same time in my dev environment.
All apps run in a Vagrant box on Debian 8 with Flaks 0.10.1
When I start in a shell the first flask app with debug and reload enabled and I touch a file on the project, all works fine. The flask app reload and I see the changes.
When I start another flask app in a second shell in debug mode at the same time, the app won’t reload.
In all cases, only the first app reload.
When I quit the app that won’t reload, I get this error.
