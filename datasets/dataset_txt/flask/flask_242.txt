Expected Behavior
Help texts for commands (and options) should consistently use either the imperative or present tense, not a mixture of both. This has no impact on the functional behaviours of the CLI, just a minor UX error.
Actual Behavior
Executing flask --help gives:
[... snip ...]

Options:
  --version  Show the flask version
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  routes           Show the routes for the app.
  run              Runs a development server.
  shell            Runs a shell in the app context.
Note that run and shell are using present tense whereas routes, --version and --help are using the imperative.
Environment
Python version: 3.7.0
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
