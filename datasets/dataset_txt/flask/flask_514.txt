Similar to the static route, add configuration and a route to serve uploaded files. Default to os.path.join(app.instance_path, 'uploads') and /media/<path:filename>. I've observed new developers thinking they should place user uploads in the static folder, which is not a good pattern (since that would be modifying package assets). A separate media folder will hopefully help with this.
