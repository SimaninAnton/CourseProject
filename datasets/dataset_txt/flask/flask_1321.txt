I spent couple of hours yesterday trying to understand why tojson output had a different order from json.dumps order.
The thing is that Flask sets sort_keys to True by default (see https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/json.py#L102). Is it possible to add something regarding this, and the JSON_SORT_KEYS in the doc ?
