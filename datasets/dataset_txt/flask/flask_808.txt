Hi,
On the A Minimal Application under Quickstart, you have code for a minimal Flask implementation, although it should be added the app.run so it can actually run the app, and load the server.
This is the form for applications that are connected to a WSGI server, which I believe beginners won't be doing that as one of their first steps.
Another minor correction, is on URL Building also under Quickstart, it has:
print url_for('profile', username='John Doe')
I believe should be : print url_for('user', username='John Doe')
