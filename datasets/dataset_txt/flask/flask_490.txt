I always use app.run(debug=True) during the developer session. When I update a .htlm file the server restart and you can see the change.
Now I started to work with
@app.template_filter()
but even if you are in the debug mode, if you change a .html file, you have to restart the server manually to see your change. I notice this weird behavior only when you define an @app.template_filter()
