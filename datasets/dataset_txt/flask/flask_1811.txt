Hi there,
I was reading through the documentation in the tutorial, and I think it may be beneficial to a lot of users (like myself) who develop on remote servers to include information about the optional host parameter in app.run():
app.run(host='your public ip')
It is listed on Application Setup Code at the bottom, but since the first page, 'Quickstart' demos an application, I think it should be included there (or at least linked).
