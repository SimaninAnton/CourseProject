Method is_json (flask/wrappers.py:112) tests whether mimetype is in format 'application/...+json'. According to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045, mime types are case insensitive.
'The type, subtype, and parameter names are not case sensitive. For example, TEXT, Text, and TeXt are all equivalent top-level media types.'
So mimetype 'ApLiCaTiOn/jSoN' is technically fine (and yes, extremely rare) and as the method tests the mimetype just for lowercase mimetype 'application/json' the previous example will fail, yet it should be ok.
