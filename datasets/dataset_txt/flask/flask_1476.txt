Default exception handling that kicks in when an exception occours that is not caught. In debug mode the exception will be re-raised immediately, otherwise it is logged and the handler for a 500 internal server error is used. If no such handler exists, a default 500 internal server error message is displayed.
Occours should be occurs.
I looked around in the project code to see if i could update this, but it looks like the docs subdir is no longer used? I could be wrong, if you let me know where this is at I'll update it and send a PR :)
