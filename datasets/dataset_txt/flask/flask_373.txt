With the latest release (flask 1.0.0), unicode attachement filenames are allowed by flask.
I was waiting for this change and it seems to work great using the builtin dev server. However, gunicorn on the production server does not support latin-1 encoding for the headers and only supports ascii.
Originaly flask also opted for ASCII encoding, however commit 336d6a4 changed this and since then latin-1 is used.
What was the rational to switch to latin-1? I know, officially it's allowed, however gunicorn decided to only support ASCII: (see related issue)
it's well documented around the web that HTTP headers should be ASCII
Is there a change that flask also switches back to ASCII?
