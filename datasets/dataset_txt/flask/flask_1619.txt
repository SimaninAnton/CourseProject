I think it would be convenient if we could have a flash_error and get_flashed_errors (I don't know if this is to be included in Jinja, or here) method, because its quite a pain to filter through the categories every time, especially when the messages and errors must be on different parts of the page.
If you guys do approve, I would like to be able to write the code for solving the issue, if you don't mind.
