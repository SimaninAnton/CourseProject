I noticed that there are no helpers for Etag or Last-Modified based caching.
That way we could use
def json():
    etag(some_etag)
    last_modified(some_timestamp)

    some_response = do_expensive_stuff
    return some_response
which is very useful when you implement an API with expensive operations which often get requests for the exactly same response. Add a caching proxy and and they are only expensive once.
Sinatra (Ruby) has those helpers: https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/v1.4.5/lib/sinatra/base.rb#L439-L554
