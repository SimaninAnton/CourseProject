Is there a way to design blueprints to incorporate DELETE?
I've been getting a error for a long time because I want to implement a form button action to just do a basic delete functionality for my app.
Method Not Allowed

The method is not allowed for the requested URL.
This is what my method looks like and nothing seems to be working...
@mod.route('/region/<region_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_region(region_id):
It seems as if Flask only does GET and POST not DELETE or PUT... And my only alternative is to do GET based DELETE methods as an alternative workaround... this however when logging proves to be not the best way to display my data and how it is modified or accessed. Any advice here? Thanks a bunch.
Also, I'm not making an API ... I just want to make a link to delete one specific entry.
GET based DELETE

@mod.route('/region/<region_id>/delete', methods=['GET'])
def delete_region(region_id):
