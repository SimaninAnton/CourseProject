The login example in the quickstart guide has an incorrect or unclear comment at the end. If the comment is referring to the error = 'Invalid username/password' line, then this code will NOT be executed if the request method was GET. If the comment is meant to mean that code placed after the comment would execute, then it should be re-worded as such.
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if valid_login(request.form['username'],
                       request.form['password']):
            return log_the_user_in(request.form['username'])
        else:
            error = 'Invalid username/password'
    # this is executed if the request method was GET or the
    # credentials were invalid
