route method takes *options which catches all keyword arguments and passes it further to *url_rule_class which -- in case of typo like 'method' instead of 'methods' -- leads to misleading exception:
[..]
File "/[..]/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 943, in add_url_rule
  rule = self.url_rule_class(rule, methods=methods, **options)
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'method'
