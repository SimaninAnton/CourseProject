I'm wondering if we can be slightly more permissive in the type of file we can use to specify the application instance. .wsgi seems to be a paradigm that it might sense to include. Look forward to hearing back on this!
Expected Behavior
export FLASK_APP=/path/to/app.wsgi
flask shell
>>> working terminal yay! (i can import the sqla db object and do stuff)
Actual Behavior
export FLASK_APP=/path/to/app.wsgi
flask shell
Traceback (most recent call last):

flask.cli.NoAppException: The file provided (/path/to/python.wsgi) does exist but is not a valid Python file.  This means that it cannot be used as application.  Please change the extension to .py
Environment
Python version: Python 3.5.2
Flask version: Flask==0.12.2
Werkzeug version: Werkzeug==0.14.1
