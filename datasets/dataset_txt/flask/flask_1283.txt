A cStringIO file containing pdf data is uploaded using send_file:
# pdf is the cStringIO instance.
return send_file(pdf, mimetype="application/pdf",
                         as_attachment=True,
                         attachment_filename="basicreport.pdf")
this works on android when using firefox. On chrome the download fails with an "Untitled" filename.
When manually creating the response manually all works fine..
response = make_response(pdf.read())
response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf'
response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=basicreport.pdf'
