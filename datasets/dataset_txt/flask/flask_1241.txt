Under SQL Abstraction Layer in the docs it says
If you just want to use the database system (and SQL) abstraction layer you basically only need the engine:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData
But a few lines down is given the example
users = Table('users', metadata, autoload=True)
For this, Table also needs to be imported.
