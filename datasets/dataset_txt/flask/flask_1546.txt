It would be really nice to have a way to disable the LedgeIt button (so that I couldn't post tracebacks with potentially sensitive information to a public permanent storage with a single click or by accidentally hitting enter) or make it point to 255.255.255.255 without turning off the debugging mode entirely.
Perhaps there can be a way to pass arguments to DebuggedApplication.init from werkzeug.debug (through **options of app.run or otherwise).
