I have a server set up where there is a front-end web server (i.e. proxy) sitting in front of my Flask application. Because of this, I need to be able to generate external links that have a different url than the actual requests coming to my Flask application.
e.g. my app is running on http://foo.example.com:1234/, but url_for(..., _external=True) needs to generate things like "https://some.other.com/"
The suggested way of doing this, by changing SERVER_NAME, doesn't work because that is for both url_for() and by the underlying werkzeug routing code so changing it causes 404 errors.
Would it be feasible to add an EXTERNAL_SERVER_NAME setting that is used instead?
