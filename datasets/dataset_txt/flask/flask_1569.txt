In the future please consider to publish the flask documentation not only in PDF but also in formats easily readable by an ebook reader like Kindle or Nook. At least for me it's much easier to read longer documentation on a e-ink device rather than a monitor, and PDF are rendered quite awfully on my Kindle 3g.
I see that there's a builder for Sphinx that permits to build epub files along with their HTML versions here: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/builders.html#module-sphinx.builders.epub
ePub would be a easier format to convert, through Calibre we could have a 1:1 conversion in MOBI format too.
Thank you
