There has to be a best practice document for extension development covering these things:
naming your extension
using the flaskext namespace
properly specifying dependencies
making ==dev versioning work
what belongs into a config and what not (deployment stuff into config, rest in the init call)
when to use init_extension(app) versus extension = Extension(app)
