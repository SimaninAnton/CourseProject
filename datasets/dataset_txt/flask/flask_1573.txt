If the test client could set debug=True, it would allow testing with assertions in view functions hit by the test client.
When updating tests for pull request 336, I noticed the testing pattern of making assertions inside an inner view function -- while clever -- must be done carefully. Because the test client does not set debug=True, the exceptions caused by the assertions were swallowed (which could have resulted in silently failing tests). With debug=False in the test client, you have to verify the status code in the test client to ensure all assertions pass, which the test case now does.
