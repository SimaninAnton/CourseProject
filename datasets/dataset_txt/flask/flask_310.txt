I need to map multiple domains to a single app but each unique domain also has an "admin" subdomain.
Examples:
admin.example1.com
admin.example2.com
where the subdomain and domains are essentially the same blueprints with just different things pulled from the db.
So far I've only seen that you need to hardcode the SERVER_NAME in the config. Is there another way to do this?
