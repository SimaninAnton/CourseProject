When the app runs in debug mode, exceptions in handling GET requests would be displayed on the page and logging output. But for POST requests, it only returns "400 Bad Request", without any traceback, making debugging difficult. If it's a bad idea to display the traceback in web page, at least it should be displayed in the logging output.
