If I use try and except, Flask still prints the "Running on http..." from the try clause.
I have:
try:
    app.run(host='public_ip.com')
except Exception:
    app.run(host='local_ip')
I get:
* Running on http://public_ip.com/
* Running on http://local_ip/
Even though the second one is the only one that is running.
