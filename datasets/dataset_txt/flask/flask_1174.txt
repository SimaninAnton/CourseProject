Tests unrelated to flask run when I follow the "living on the edge" setup instructions (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/#living-on-the-edge) and run make. This was especially confusing for someone like me who is new to the project because some of these tests fail.
They're located in path/to/flask/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/tests/
