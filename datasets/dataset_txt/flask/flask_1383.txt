So I'm not sure if this is meant to happen, but when you attempt to use MethodViews as described in the docs http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/views/#method-views-for-apis, I get an Assertion Error generated by the app.add_url_rule added in 661ee54. This commit was created to fix #570.
The MethodView example in the docs calls for registering multiple routes to the same class, which causes an AssertionError to be raised.
Is there another way to create a method based set of views without causing this error to be raised? Would it be better to switch from an AssertionError to a Warning that could be ignored?
