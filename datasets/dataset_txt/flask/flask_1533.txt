Using
return jsonify(d), 201
results in returning the client a response with the intended status code and body, but with a text/html mimetype.
I realize this may not be the intended way of using jsonify and the status code shortcut, nevertheless if would be a neat feature.
For the records, if you need to use jsonify and need to return a custom status code you could do
response = jsonify(d)
response.status_code = 201
return response
Or extend jsonify (I created a gist here: https://gist.github.com/2336085).
