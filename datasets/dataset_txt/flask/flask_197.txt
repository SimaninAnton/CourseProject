It's possible to donate to support Flask, but (despite several Flask extensions being lifted), neither Flask itself nor other Pallets projects are available via Tidelift subscription.
According to current estimates, Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja2, Click, and ItsDangerous could each be earning USD $417/month (a total of over $2K/month).
(I recently lifted an open source project I've been maintaining for over 10 years – which has been in use at Google, Venmo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, et al. – and only today got my first cent of financial support thanks to Tidelift.)
Just wanted to make sure you knew about Tidelift in case it's an option for you.
