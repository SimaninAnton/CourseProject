Hi.
I've detected an issue with supporting unicode filenames in send_file.
If send_file attempts to respond with utf-8 in http headers, the answer is empty, the log contains something like "http-headers should containbe latin-1".
I know that browser support IS A MESS, but it seems, that sending two filenames (filename= and filename*=) separated by semicolon should work.
I'd like this to be handled by flask or werkzeug. Will you accept such pull request?
