I see that there is an suggestion saying "To fix this make sure to import all your view modules, database models and everything related at a central place before the application starts serving requests."
We have encountered this problem while adding an first-installation page for our app like WordPress. Now we are using Flask-Security for user management. When our app is visited at the first time, the installation page will display and allow user to config the database, admin account etc.
The problem is that we need to setup the Flask-Security after the first request that providing the database setting because the Security instance can't be inited without a datastore.
Do you have any suggestions about this situation ?
Thanks ~
