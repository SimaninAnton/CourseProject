Running a flask application with debug=True (and thus, use_reloader=True) in Pycharm, breakpoints inside view functions don't work. Setting use_reloader=False works, but I miss the reloader. This works as expected when running on Python 2.7. I'm not sure if this is an issue on Flask, Werkzeug or Pycharm. Is there somebody with better insights on Werkzeug internals and how the Pycharm debugger works that could help me with this?.
