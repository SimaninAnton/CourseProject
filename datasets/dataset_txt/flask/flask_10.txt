Consider the following blueprint file:
from flask import Blueprint

bp = Blueprint('bp', __name__)


@book.route('/')
def bp():
    return "hello"
When one tries to register bp from this file like so:
from app.bp import bp
app.register_blueprint(bp)
This error is raised:
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'name'
The cause is obvious, but the error message does not correspond with the actual error. This could be fixed by checking if an added blueprint is of type Blueprint, or a subclass, and returning an error if that's not the case.
