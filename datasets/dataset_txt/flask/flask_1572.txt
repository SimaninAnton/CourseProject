When debugging an application, it's surprising to get a simple "400 Bad Request" when accessing a form parameter that doesn't exist instead of a full traceback. I always forget that I also need to set TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS.
Is there a reason why this isn't set by default when debugging is enabled?
