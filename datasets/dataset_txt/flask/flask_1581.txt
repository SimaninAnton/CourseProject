(And in general in the quickstart) Instead of using "pass" which causes the code to break when pasted into hello.py:
@app.route('/projects/')
def projects():
pass
@app.route('/about')
def about():
pass
It would be nice if the code did enough so that the first-time user isn't faced with a non-working system. Even something as simple as:
@app.route('/projects/')
def projects():
return "projects"
@app.route('/about')
def about():
return "about"
