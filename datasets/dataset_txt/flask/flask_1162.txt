I ran into this problem today with one of my applications trying to make it public to my local network.
C:\Users\Savion\Documents\GitHub\Example-Flask-Website>flask\Scripts\python run.
py
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Restarting with reloader
10.101.37.124 - - [26/Oct/2014 15:51:23] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 -
Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
10.101.37.124 - - [26/Oct/2014 15:51:38] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 -
The problem that i run into is the fact that this app continuously attempts to default to localhost. It is not until 2 Ctrl + C, that it goes to 0.0.0.0, then I still receive a 404 error in my browser. I do have routes that are valid when running locally. I have tried to create a new virtualenv and i still recieve the same error, I reset the firewall rule on this application. All effort that did not return rewarded.
Any Ideas onto why my app makes an attempt to startup on the localhost first then moves over, but then returns a 404?
