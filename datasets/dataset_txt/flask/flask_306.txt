TLDR;
Use PIPENV_DONT_LOAD_ENV=1 pipenv shell
Expected Behavior
Flask sets/overrides environment variables specified in .env each time flask run is run.
Actual Behavior
Flask is unaware that the .env file in my project directory has changed and does not refresh it's own environment variables.
Environment
Pipenv
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
