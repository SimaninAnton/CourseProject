Expected Behaviour
User sessions should remain valid across versions.
Actual Behaviour
itsdangerous v1.0 was release about 16 hours ago.
Users are signed out when an build of flask that has depended on the new itsdangerous v1.0 is released. This is because the new version has a breaking change that changes the session hashing algorithm.
