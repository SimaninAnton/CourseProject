Hello.
I am trying to create a Catch-All function which serves every URL. I am following the example from http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/57/
Here is the code snippet:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch_all(path):
    return 'You want path: %s' % path

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run() 
This code snippet does not catch all of the URLs. Am I missing something here?
Thanks.
