In the WTForms' documentation on displaying errors it gives an example of putting all of a form's errors in a neat little section (second example) but when I run the aforementioned code Flask returns:
ValueError
ValueError: too many values to unpack
I imagine it comes from this line:
{% for field_name, field_errors in form.errors if field_errors %}
Is their example Django specific or am I just missing something?
