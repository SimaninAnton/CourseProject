It would be nice if test_client() would accept default environ dictionary. That would stop us doing hacks like this over and over.
For example:
test_client = app.test_client(defailt_environ = {
    "REMOTE_ADDR": "127.0.0.1"
})
default_environ should be then passed down all the way to environment_base args of EnvironBuilder in test.py.
Thank you!
