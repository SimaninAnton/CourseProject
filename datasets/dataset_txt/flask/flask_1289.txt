Second paragraph in
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/fastcgi/
reads
Please make sure in advance that any app.run() calls you might have in your application file are inside an if __ name __ == '__ main __': block or moved to a separate file. Just make sure itâ€™s not called because this will always start a local WSGI server which we do not want if we deploy that application to FastCGI.
Shouldn't this be "start a local HTTP server"
