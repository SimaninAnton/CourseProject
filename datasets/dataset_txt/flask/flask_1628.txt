The docs are kinda inconsistent between route() and add_url_rule. The former should be documented as a decorator version of the latter which is true since Flask 0.3 at least.
Also with 0.7 and 0.8 we have some attributes on view functions that can have meanings attached. These now have a separate headline in the API docs, but I guess it would make sense to tidy this up a bit.
