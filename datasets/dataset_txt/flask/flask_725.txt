Hello I am working on a flask app and i want to creeate a query that has multiple filters in order to show the correct results within the same table:
example:
tab = session.query(Tabs).filter_by(column1 = hello).filter_by(column2 = world).all()
but none of the methods i am trying will work.
BOTH of the definition columns are from the same table....
