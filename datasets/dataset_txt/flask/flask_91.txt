Expected Behavior
Should be able to run flask with FLASK_ENV=development or production
Actual Behavior
I get the output
Serving Flask app "simple" (lazy loading)
Environment: production
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Use a production WSGI server instead.
Debug mode: on
Restarting with stat
c:\users\Riprock\Projects\simple s&r\venv\scripts\python.exe: No module named C:\Users\Riprock\Projects\Simple S&R\venv\Scripts\flask
Environment
Python version: 3.7.4
Flask version: 1.1.1
Werkzeug version: 0.15.5
I can't seem to get a flask server running after updating to the latest version of Flask and python. Before the update my FLASK_ENV=development and FLASK_DEBUG=1. Then I updated and started to encounter the error. I tried rebuilding my venv and getting the same error.
