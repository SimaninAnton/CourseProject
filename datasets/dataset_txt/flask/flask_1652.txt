Hi,
I've encountered a strange bug while working with Flask. When I have two modules (say 'frontend' and 'admin') static files aren't found in frontend module. Admin module is url_prefixed with '/admin' and everything is fine with it.
The only workaround I found was to add a /static route in frontend module and serve files manually.
I've created a simple demo app to show the bug. It's available here: https://github.com/tomekwojcik/Flask-Module-Static-Files
Best ragards.
