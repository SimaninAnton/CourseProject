I have multiple route handlers with the same path but with different methods that they handles, e.g.
@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
@app.route('/users', methods=['POST'])
The problem occurs when a CORS pre-flight OPTIONS request is made to /users. Since the route and method match both endpoints, the wrong endpoint is sometimes returned which is problematic if you are trying to use the matched url_rule for any logic. In my case, I was using request.url_rule.methods to add the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header to the response.
