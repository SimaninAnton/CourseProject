We have been using flask-session for our sessions and noticed that there were no easy methods on flask or flask-session to handle session destruction/regeneration. These are practical as they aid in preventing session fixation attacks (e.g. when someone knows your session id and it doesn't get changed on login so they can reuse your session):
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation
We saw that flask-kvsession has some logic for this:
https://github.com/mbr/flask-kvsession/blob/0.6.2/flask_kvsession/__init__.py#L89-L124
but we were already invested into flask-session (added sha256 signing support) that we decided to implement similar logic there as well:
fengsp/flask-session#27
However, I'm not sure that's the ideal interface. I think the final product would look something more like
flask.session.destroy()
flask.session.regenerate()
which in turn call flask.session_interface.destroy_session(self, app, session) and flask.session_interface.regenerate_session(self, app, session).
What are your thoughts on this?
