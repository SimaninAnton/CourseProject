Seeing that I have (some) experience in Flask I really really want to use it for a new project we're about to start here in our company. I'm now looking for a couple websites that are either or all of the below:
high traffic
slick looking
big/known names
I checked out the "powered by" part of the Flask website (http://flask.pocoo.org/community/poweredby/) but I can't find any big names on there. I think I once saw a little list of good sites using Flask, but I can't find them anymore.
Anybody any tips?
