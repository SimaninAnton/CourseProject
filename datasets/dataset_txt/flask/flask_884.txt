Hi,
is it possible to let Flask run in a Thread?
I have the problem that in my project, I have to use the VBox XPCOM API, this api work only in the main thread:
bash return xpcom._xpcom.WaitForEvents(timeout) Exception: wrong thread, use the main thread
Now I want run as example a Job thread, this thread have to do sometimes, something with VBox.
And I want to let run the Flask Server with the arg threaded=True.
Now it will be very nice, if I can spawn the app.run into a Thread and in the main Thread run a loop whats call the VBox XPCOM API
