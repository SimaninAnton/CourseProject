When loading my flask module python -m project.modules.flaskhandler.py everything works nicely. Unfortunately, if I enable debug mode and use_reloader, the module is loaded, but when reloader restarts the application, it changes my sys.path.
sys.path's first value changes from '' to 'project/modules/' which prevents absolute imports from other modules in my project.
I was able to work around this problem with the following code at the top of my flaskhandler.py file:
import sys
import os

# Flask reloader hack
sys.path.append(os.getcwd())
