Hi,
I was trying to create a small sample for another issue and run into a problem. I have a very simple demo app. This is the main file:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sign import sign as sign_blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(sign_blueprint, url_prefix='/sign')
    app.run()
Blueprint sign lives inside the sign directory and the __init__.py file there declares it.
from flask import Blueprint
sign = Blueprint('sign', __name__)
from . import views
views just contains a simple handler that returns the string ok when requested. The problem is that my request was completely ignored. I started debugging and the routes collection has only the static route. The details for my blueprint disappeared.
Writing
http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/order/2345
http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/order/
http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/
http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign
gets the same 404 error. It seems that somehow my blueprint is ignored and no route is created.
Any ideas?
Thank you,
Federico
