The following line contains a del <local_variable> as the last line of the function (inside a finally block):
flask/flask/cli.py
Line 135 in 2c68f86
 del tb 
This looks suspicious since there is usually no need to del a variable that is local to a function in its last line. If this is unintended it should be removed, otherwise there should probably be a comment in the code explaining why this is necessary?
