If I am not mistaken the docs lack a good description on how to setup Flask to use a different application root path. I summarized my current understanding in this Gist.
Also the name of Flask's APPLICATION_ROOT config variable is pretty misleading. One could wrongly assume that it affects routing (stripping away application_root) and url_for() (prepending application_root). I do not even get the point of the current APPLICATION_ROOT setting because there already is SESSION_COOKIE_PATH.
