Implementing Facebook authentication, I need a context processor that will insert a current_user variable to the template context by performing some operations on the cookies/request. Since context processors need the app object for the decorator, they are rather hard to put in another file, and this feels unclean.
Could something be done to enable putting context processors in a context_processors.py file by themselves, short of importing and decorating them one by one?
