Hi everyone.
I'm new to Flask, and following the tutorial.
Untill The First Test of Testing Flask Applications
the code bellow
def test_empty_db(self):
    rv = self.app.get('/')
    assert 'No entries here so far' in rv.data
went wrong.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\Programming\Python3_mine\Flask\flaskr\flaskr_tests.py", line 21, in test_empty_db
    assert 'No entries here so far' in rv.data
TypeError: Type str doesn't support the buffer API
Then I checked the rv.data's type.(rv is a response_class object)
And it's bytes type. So I use b'No entries here so far' and it worked.
Did this happen to everyone else?
I think someone should correct the document to save beginners' time.
And I'm still working on my English so forgive me if there're any grammar or spelling mistake.
Thank you for reading!! :)
