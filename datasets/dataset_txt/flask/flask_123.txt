This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
I'm working on a large Flask project. Occasionally, Flask will give me an ImportError, for example the following:
NoAppException: While importing "application", an ImportError was raised:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/fintan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/cli.py", line 235, in locate_app
    __import__(module_name)
  File "/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/application.py", line 1, in <module>
    from learnershape.app import *
  File "/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/app.py", line 4, in <module>
    from learnershape import core
  File "/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/core/__init__.py", line 2, in <module>
    from . import views
ImportError: cannot import name views
When I restart the server, the error goes away and Flask runs perfectly.
Do you think this could be due to a) a bad import structure, b) Flask not reloading modules correctly, c) .pyc files?
Expected Behavior
Flask should only show an ImportError when there is a problem with module imports.
This problem occurs at least twice a day, but I haven't been able to get it to occur yet in a minimal version. If anyone has time to look into this, I can add you as a collaborator to our repository.
Actual Behavior
Flask shows an ImportError which persists until Flask is restarted, then goes away.
