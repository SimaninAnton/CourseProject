As discussed on the mailing list:
http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/archive/2011/7/22/application-mount-point/#abdbeee9ca8eda65f0e17a0aeb4fab5f
Make it possible to run a Flask application from the command line with this:
$ python -mflask.server yourapplication
What would that do? It would attempt to import yourapplication and then looks for an object called "app". If it finds that it uses that, otherwise you would have to do (yourapplication:application) or something. Then it runs that with the development server.
What would that solve?
First of all it would no longer require if __name__ == '__main__', secondly it would solve the double importing problems we commonly see as well as the fact that modules work different to applications. Lastly the application object would no longer have to be a Flask application object but just any WSGI application object.
