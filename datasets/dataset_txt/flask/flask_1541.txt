An app can inject_url_defaults but it cannot otherwise change the url_for behavior. I'd like for url_for to check the current_app to see if it provides its own url_for. If it does; use it. Otherwise proceed as currently implemented.
An alternative would be to register url-building handlers, but this would not fit well with multiple-app processes given that the current url_for is module-level.
I'm writing a Flask extension to provide cross-application URL-building, and I'd like to add a custom url_for method to all Flask instances which have been passed through init_app.
