app = Flask(__name__)
app.url_map.host_matching = True
app.url_map._rules_by_endpoint['static'][0].host = 'mydomain.com'  # XXX better way to do this?
with app.test_request_context():
    print url_for('static', filename='foo', _external=True)
=>
'http:///static/foo'
Expected 'http://mydomain.com/static/foo'.
Am I missing something, or is this a bug?
Thanks for looking and for the great work on Flask.
