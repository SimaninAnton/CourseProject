I've been trying to stream some data out of the database into a downloadable CSV file and having trouble at every turn. I've been following what guides I can find. Response() gives errors and setting headers on make_response() fails to produce a response the browser recognizes as savable (even with response.headers["Content-Disposition"] = "attachment;filename=study.csv" ). I've never gone this direction with data extractions so I can't say I know what to expect with HTTP.
Anyhow, here are the messages from attempts to use Response:
   return Response(generate(), mimetype='text/csv')
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

    return Response(generate())
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

    return Response("1,2,3")
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
