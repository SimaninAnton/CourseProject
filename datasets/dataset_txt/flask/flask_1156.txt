Hi,
it would be extremely nice to have an extended or second url_for which only provides an url to the view function without the need of parameters. At the moment I have to workaround the standard url_for by making all parameters optional, which i think is not the right way around this, in order to make it usable in dynamical delivered javascript rest clients.
best regards
