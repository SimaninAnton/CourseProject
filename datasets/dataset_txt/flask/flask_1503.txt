My webapp is a single file app. It's also 37K now. I'm editing the file using BBedit via the built-in SFTP feature in BBedit. In the last 24hours I've been experiencing latency between my desktop and the remote system. When I "save" my PY file and flask detects the change it immediately tried to reload it. When I was using vim locally it worked great. Now that I'm going remote... (1) flask tried to reload the py file but it's only partially there.
(yes, it would be better if BBedit save the file to a tmp file and then renamed it, however, I do not claim to know the motivation for the current methodology)
Anyway, give than I have no idea what the flask issues are... I'd recommend a token at the end of the file that could be detected to make sure that the entire file is ready before loading it.
Also, (2) the reloader seems to crash quietly each time.
