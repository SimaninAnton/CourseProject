Expected Behavior
In flask website use tutorials, in the third step flask run to run my web, appear this mistake.
In py files line first, I use the # - coding: utf-8 -- specified utf-8.
I'm writing code in Pycharm. Start the web with the CMD run command.
I copy the project directory into ubuntu and it works.
No related problems were found on the Internet.
Please give us some ideas and solve this problem.
thank you
Below is a screenshot of the Pycharm
