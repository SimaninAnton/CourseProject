Found this while searching for a solution: python-babel/flask-babel#19
In this issue, @ralfonso mentions that he is having trouble importing an editable babel package. I am having this problem too, but with another extension (flask_mongokit).
from the python interpreter, if I import:
from flaskext.mongokit import MongoKit
I get an ImportError: No module named mongokit
When I run my tests with nosetests, everything is fine. When I import from ipython, it works too. But running and importing from the plain interpreter fails.
sys.path contains:
~/.virtualenvs/myflask_project/src/flask-mongokit
I am not sure what is going on, because I know I ran the application before, and since then I pip installed/uninstalled many packages (non-editable).
NOTE
After uninstalling flask-openid, the setup works again as intended. Is something wrong with flask-openid's setup? Or with the flask exthook functionality?
