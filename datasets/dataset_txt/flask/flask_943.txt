Running Flask, on Linux or Windows or OS X, if you run:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "foo"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
...then python kills itself with an error (cant remember from top of my head...as I am not at my PC).
However, when you remove debug=True everything is fine.
Running # pip uninstall werkzeug
