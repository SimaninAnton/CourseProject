Flask is a very well-designed project to build many kinds of small to big websites, but you run into a problem if you want to do e-commerce.
I think you should consider porting this to Flask:

It seems to be the most popular Django e-commerce solution.
I'm not sure how much would have to be changed. Note you would need to port over some of the plugins like for Paypal, which is 1200 lines.
Maybe it is even possible to have some if Django and if Flask lines and keep it all in one codebase.
I realize this is not an easy bug, but maybe if enough people are interested, something could happen one day.
