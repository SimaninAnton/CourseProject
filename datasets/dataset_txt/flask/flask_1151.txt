There is one short section on instance paths in the configuration handling doc, but nothing else. I have questions like the following:
Suppose I want to separate the application package, the instance directory and the configuration file. In other words, I want all three to be in different locations within the filesystem and I don't want those locations to be hard-coded in the package. The WSGI script should load the application factory from the package and pass the instance path and the configuration file to the factory, after which the factory returns an application object. The application and some of the blueprints registered on it should use the instance directory for uploads but not for configuration. How should I write my code in order to realize that?
Please help me find the answer to the question above, and please consider providing more documentation on the instance path!
