http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/wsgi-standalone/ talks about Tornado's scaling properties, but does not mention that most of this scalability is lost when the single-threaded asynchronous server is combined with a synchronous WSGI framework like flask. I see a lot of questions on stackoverflow from people who use Flask on Tornado and are surprised that they are not getting any concurrency.
I think it would be best to remove Tornado from this page entirely since Tornado is not really focused on being a WSGI container and WSGI apps are nearly always better served by a multi-threaded server like gunicorn or uwsgi. If you do want to keep a mention of Tornado as a WSGI server, please acknowledge its limitations (single-threaded) and that it really only makes sense when you want to combine a WSGI app with a Tornado-native app in the same process.
