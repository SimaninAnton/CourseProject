I've been experimenting with Flask lately and when I came to this part of the tutorial Redirects, I encountered a type error saying:
TypeError: redirect() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
But when I checked the API documentation for Flask.redirect it states that it accepts 2 arguments location and code. Could this be a bug? I am using Flask 0.10.1, Python 3.4 on Windows 7.
