Expected Behavior
I have mounted multiple blueprints for serving static files at the same base url, as I use this pattern when developing with other web frameworks (though I am unfamiliar with the limitations of python web programming). Perhaps this is the incorrect suggested mechanism for accomplishing this with Flask?
app.register_blueprint(Blueprint('mybp', __name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path=''), url_prefix='/a')
app.register_blueprint(Blueprint('mybp1', __name__, static_folder='static_', static_url_path=''), url_prefix='/a')
Actual Behavior
The files in static where accessible and the ones in static_ were not. The behavior was silent, there was no traceback.
Environment
Python version: 2.7.12
Flask version: 0.12.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
thanks so much, y'all! I'm just trying to figure out how to make an abstraction for my many folders to be accessible from a single route that serves static files.
