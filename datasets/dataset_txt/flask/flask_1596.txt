This makes it impossible to add data to session in said callbacks. For example, the following code does not work, because session is never stored:
@app.before_request
def before_request():
    u = session.get('user')
    g.user = u and db.User(u) or None

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    session['user'] = g.user and dict(g.user) or None
    return response
