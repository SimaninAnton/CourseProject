Expected Behavior
On the "Deploying With Setuptools page", the setup.cfg code snippet should look like this:
[egg_info]
tag_build = .dev
tag_date = 1

[aliases]
release = egg_info -RDb
Actual Behavior
Instead it looks like this:
[egg_info] tag_build = .dev tag_date = 1

[aliases] release = egg_info -RDb ‚Äù
Also note the erroneous quotation mark at the end.
