Expected Behavior
Import the Python-Markdown module and run the Flask app
# flask_test.py
from flask import Flask
import markdown

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, world!'
Actual Behavior
export FLASK_APP=flask_test.py
flask run

Usage: flask-script.py run [OPTIONS]

Error: The file/path provided (flask_test) does not appear to exist.  Please verify the path is correct.  If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py
If I simply comment out the import markdown line, the app launches/works just fine.
Environment
Python version: 2.7.12
Flask version: 0.12
Werkzeug version: 0.11.2
Python-Markdown version: 2.6.8
I'm running on Windows 10 using Git Bash (mintty), which lets me use export instead of set for FLASK_APP. However I found that set doesn't change the outcome.
