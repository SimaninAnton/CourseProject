Currently getting a TypeError: Decimal('0.10') is not JSON serializable error when, you guessed it, I try to encode a Decimal.
I found an accepted fix here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4019856/decimal-to-json, but not sure where I should be implementing that within Flask. I tried it within my main app file, but it doesn't appear to be working.
