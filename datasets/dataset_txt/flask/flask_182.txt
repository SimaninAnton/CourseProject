Description
If you have python file with wsgi extension (or any other than .py), you can't execute flask run command. (When you execute the script with .run() in it, it works fine).
Example
For example when you create file app.wsgi with simple content:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
And of course you set the environment variable FLASK_APP=app.wsgi
you actually get:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 325, in __call__
    self._flush_bg_loading_exception()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 313, in _flush_bg_loading_exception
    reraise(*exc_info)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 302, in _load_app
    self._load_unlocked()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 317, in _load_unlocked
    self._app = rv = self.loader()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 372, in load_app
    app = locate_app(self, import_name, name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py", line 246, in locate_app
    'Could not import "{name}".'.format(name=module_name)
NoAppException: Could not import "app.wsgi".
I think it's essential to run also wsgi files (you can run "default" wsgi.py, but not anything with .wsgi in the end)
Environment
Python version: 2.7.15rc1
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
