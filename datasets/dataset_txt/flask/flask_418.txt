Every time we use flask there is some basic code we need to write and some directories we need to create. We can automate that particular cumbersome task by something like flask init which will let's say create an app.py file containing the basic imports statements, a basic hello world route, code to start the server on the default port, basic directories like a template, static etc.
Basically something like Django's django-admin startproject .
