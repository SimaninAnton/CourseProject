Hi,
I try to pass information in headers, such as passwords.
When receiving it in my program, special characters are not properly decoded, such as €£ and french accented chars.
It works fine if they're encoding in regular http args.
Example:
curl -v --header "user_email:toto@toto.com" --header "user_password:é€" -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/private/v1.0/auth"
Trying ::1...
connect to ::1 port 5000 failed: Connection refused
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
GET /api/private/v1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
Accept: /
user_email:toto@toto.com
user_password:é€`
On the app side:
Headers=Accept: /
Content-Length:
User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
User-Password: Ã©â�¬
Host: localhost:5000
User-Email: toto@toto.com
