The test suite is a bit of a mess as far as how each test sets up an app context, request context, etc.
It'd be nice to DRY this up using pytest fixtures.
Benefits:
More readable tests.
Tests are easier to write.
Tests are easier to refactor.
Tests are more robust because it's easier to run a test with multiple parameters.
This is a large project, but easy to tackle incrementally. Perhaps it should be broken into multiple issues, as each section of tests requires some specific fixtures, for example jsonify() tests require some specific json setup.
