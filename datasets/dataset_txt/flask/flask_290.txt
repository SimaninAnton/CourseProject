Expected Behavior
When you open documentations with pydoc3 <modulename> most modules just display documentation, and that's it.
Actual Behavior
When called from same directory as the user's script, pydoc3 flask will also start executing the script
itself an display timestamps, which also eventually overwrite the documentation display.
At first you see delay:
1537766131.0147438
Then overtime timestamps fill the screen. An example:
DESCRIPTION
    flask
    ~~~~~
    
    A microframework based on Werkzeug.  It's extensively documented
:1537766141.022547
1537766146.0282607
1537766151.0338132
1537766156.0372663
Using the following does not help:
 if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run()
Environment
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2-1 as reported by apt-cache policy python3-flask
Werkzeug version: unsure how to check that
