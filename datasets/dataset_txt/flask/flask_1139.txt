As well as the usual
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
Could we have the sugary treats of shortcut decorators:
@app.post('/login')            // equivalent to the above

@app.put('/article/new')    // the brave new world of REST

@app.get('/login')              // synonymous with @app.route('/login')

@app.getPost('/login')       // synonymous with @app.route('login', methods=['GET','POST']
Okay, the last one might be going a bit far (although practically it would be very useful). But in general, they're very pleasant ways to add RESTful route descriptions.
