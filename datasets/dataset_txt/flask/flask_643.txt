Python 3.6 added support for loading json from str or bytes. It handles detection of the three encodings supported by JSON. Would be nice to take advantage of this if the user is using 3.6+ instead of our basic "assume it's UTF-8" approach.
Would have to make sure simplejson also allows this (I think it does).
Then again, I'm not sure there have been any reports of Flask decoding JSON incorrectly. Maybe no real clients are encoding with anything besides UTF-8?
