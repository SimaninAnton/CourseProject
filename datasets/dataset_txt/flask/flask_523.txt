Hi,
I'm always confuse about keyword args in test method(GET, POST...).
For example, test post files or json, but I find solutions in StackOverFlow everytimes.
I debug in source code, find FlaskClient.open and werkzeug.EnvironBuilder .
Maybe, we could give some test demo in Testing and give more explict description in FakeClient.open like requests
