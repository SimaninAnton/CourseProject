My colleague said 'get Flask'.
I said 'Okay! ... wow, looks cool, and it installs so easily! ... and this site is even built on it—how delightful! ... and I can download the docs as a zipped HTML—how convenient! ... and... the link's broken—how sloppy!' ;-)
Since the site's supposed to be built on Flask, I thought this would be the place to report this. Please excuse me if this assumption is incorrect.
At http://flask.pocoo.org/, which Google took me to, clicking either of the latter links in 'Read the documentation or download as PDF and zipped HTML' took me to http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.pdf and http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.zip, respectively. Both 404ed.
