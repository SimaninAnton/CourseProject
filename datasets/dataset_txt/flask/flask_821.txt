Example project that shows issue is available here: https://github.com/sean-lynch/flask-cli-issue . I'm not sure if this is a flask cli issue or an issue with documentation. Happy to correct the docs if it's the latter.
I'm attempting to use the large app structure seen in the Flask Larger Applications documentation
First, set up a virutal environment and install flask 0.11 into that environment (requirements.txt
has all that for you).
Can successfully launch app using old app.run() mechanism found in run.py and old_launch.sh
$ python run.py
But can't seem to get to work with flask-cli. You can see both of the methods in new_launch.sh.
This throws ImportError - No module named server:
$ FLASK_APP=server FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
This loads, but doesn't register any of the views even though the Loading views... print output makes it to the console.
$ FLASK_APP=server/__init__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
How should I be loading a module with flask-cli? Or alternatively, how should I be changing the module structure to support it properly?
