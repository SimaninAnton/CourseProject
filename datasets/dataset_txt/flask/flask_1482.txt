Seems like this issue:
http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/archive/2011/8/14/pyinstaller/#429b2ac09950c2717cf7506487166a3a
was never fixed. I still get : Unhandled ImportError: No module named werkzeug.exceptions when I use pyinstaller. Any ideas on how to fix this, or perhaps actually fix this in 0.91 :-)
