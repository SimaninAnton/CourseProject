The FastCGI deployment documentation mentions that it may be necessary to configure some middleware to strip the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable of the actual script file name in order to prevent it appearing in the URL (e.g. example.com/yourapplication.fcgi/news/).
The default mod_rewrite configuration given in the CGI deployment documentation has the same issues yet no mention of this workaround is given. Please consider mentioning this on this page also.
