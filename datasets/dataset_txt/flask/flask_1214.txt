Convention is (and rightly so) that the master branch is stable. There have been several issues lately that are related to the accidental use of the development version.
Also the docs here track the development version so you can hardly blame someone for getting stuck trying to follow them when they have loads of stuff that doesn't apply to the current stable version.
Can we make an effort to sort this out?
