On : http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/dbcon/#tutorial-dbcon, the second sample code which should illustrate the teardown_request is not well formated.
@app.before_request def before_request():
g.db = connect_db()
@app.teardown_request def teardown_request(exception):
g.db.close()
Source code looks good anyway ?!?!
