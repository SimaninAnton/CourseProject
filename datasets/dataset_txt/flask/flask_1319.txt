Message flashing as implemented in Flask is currently broken, under certain conditions it's possible for messages to be flashed to the wrong tab or in extreme cases the wrong device/browser.
A correct implementation would require functionality beyond Flask's scope, message flashing itself is arguably beyond Flask's scope already.
Why not make a piss-poor user account system that exists solely in session cookies? It seems like the same logic behind Flask's message flashing functionality.
