I have two models , A and B
file A:
import ...
app = Flask(name)
@app.route('/');
def something():pass
if main:
app.run();
\\\\\\\\\\\\
file B:
import ...
app = Flask(name)
@app.route('/abc/');
def anything():pass
\\\\\\\\\\\
The question is , how can i import B in to A , so when I run A , and type localhost/abc/som in my browser , can call the function anything() in B ?
I see the document , but I have a little confused , please help , Thanks .
