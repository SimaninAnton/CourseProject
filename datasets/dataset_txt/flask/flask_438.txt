Expected Behavior
Taken directly from https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()  # claim is that argument port=some_port is not needed
Actual Behavior
Nothing happens. Script executes, but flask web server never starts.
Seems like
...this is required
app.run(port=5000)
Environment
Python version: 3.6.4
Flask version: 0.12.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
