Current docs for pluggable view (Flask.views.MethodView and Flask.views.View) decorators are a big vague - although it is mentioned that one cannot use regular view decorators, it doesn't actually give a working example how to write that decorator.
I'm proposing to use a simple active user check instead of current incomplete rate_limited example...
