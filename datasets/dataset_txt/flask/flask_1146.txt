This page http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/sqlite3/ references a function connect_to_database that isn't mentioned anywhere.
Looking at 0.9 http://flask.readthedocs.org/en/0.9/patterns/sqlite3/, it looks like this snippet should be somewhere:
def connect_to_database():
    return sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)
