Hi guys.
When I tested the example code(hello world) with debug mode, the flask did NOT respond from web request.
But without debug mode, the code was working very well.
I have tested both of python3 and python2 also a few version of flask.
I cannot imagine what is the root cause..
Somebody experienced this issue?
Environment
Python version: 3.6.2, 2.6
Flask version: 0.12.2, 0.12, 0.11
Werkzeug version: 0.12
