Expected Behavior
At the flask documentation for the request context/object http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#incoming-request-data many items in the section say "see also trusted_hosts". For example http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#flask.Request.host.
This should be a link, or obvious where to follow to understand what this is.
Actual Behavior
There isn't a link, and it's not clear what the see also is referring to (perhaps in werkzeug?)
Environment
