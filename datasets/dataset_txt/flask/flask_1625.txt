During the development of a HTTP proxy (which uses flask for the response view generation) I came into the issue of setting multiple header values.
The problem is that I get multiple Set-Cookies response from the upstream HTTP server, which I have to insert into flask's response. But currently it seems it's impossible due to the dictionary interface.
Any ideas?
