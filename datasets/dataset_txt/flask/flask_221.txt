Expected Behavior
yum install python-virtualenv in the install instruction doesn't lead to having a virtualenv binary on the path, as the problem is exactly described by https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27877/install-virtualenv-on-fedora-16 (the question is outdated, but it also applies to Fedora 29 I have been testing).
sudo yum install python-virtualenv
The solution is to do sudo yum install virtualenv instead, which is an alias to python3-virtualenv. And so an explicit -p python2.7 is needed to start a python2 env.
