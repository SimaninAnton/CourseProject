Line 85. "yourapplicaiton" where it should be "yourapplication":
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplicaiton.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)
Also, line 108, "ocurrs" where it should be "occurs":
    #: The debug flag.  Set this to `True` to enable debugging of the
    #: application.  In debug mode the debugger will kick in when an unhandled
    #: exception ocurrs and the integrated server will automatically reload
    #: the application if changes in the code are detected.
