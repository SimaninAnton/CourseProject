Hello,
I am using flask for a small web service that my mobile applications use.
I was developing the server on a normal Windows Desktop and port forwarding it through my personal home router.
I am now at the deployment stage, and I am having trouble with connections on Windows Server 2008.
The flask server runs successfully, and all endpoints are reachable on localhost, but I cannot connect from an external source. I know that the port forwarding is correct, as I have added another test application to Windows IIS to confirm that it wasn't the router's port forwarding, and that test application worked.
Hoping someone has an idea.
Thanks!
Connor
