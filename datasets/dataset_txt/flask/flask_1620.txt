Hi Armin -
I am using your make_release.py script in Bulbs, and the script was breaking when I was trying to make a release today because the parse_date function was replacing the the "st" in August (this may be an issue for other months too):
def parse_date(string):
string = string.replace('th ', ' ').replace('nd ', ' ')
.replace('rd ', ' ').replace('st ', ' ')
return datetime.strptime(string, '%B %d %Y')
