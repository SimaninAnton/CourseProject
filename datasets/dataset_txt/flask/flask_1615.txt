hi
App.config is a class based on dict object.
So we must use it as a dict later and all settings in it accessed same as a dict.
like:
app.config['DEBUG']
But i think it will be good to it can be accessed such as a class.
app.config.DEBUG
it can be down by some simple overrided methods. i write simple code for this:
class EDict(dict):
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.iteritems():
        self.__setitem__(key, value)
    dict.__init__(self)

def __getattr__(self, attr):
    return super(EDict, self).__getitem__(attr)

def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
    self[attr] = value

def __delattr__(self, key):
    return super(EDict, self).__delitem__(key)
