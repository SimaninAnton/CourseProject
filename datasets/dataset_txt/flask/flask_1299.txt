I'm building a website using Flask, and so far I love it. The only thing that constantly bothers me however, is that when I get debug output, it's always so much. And most of it is just internal error messages from Flask, which don't tell me anything. 99.9% of the time, I'm just interested in the line which led to this error which is located in my own scripts. If I know that, I normally can quickly find the solution, but all the other output just confuses me.
So; is there a way that I can just output the lines in my own written scripts that led to the error?
