Hi I am developing one page that has header, footer, menu and main body page.
The header and footer are never get change. Whennever the user clicks the menu, then it should redirect to corresponding main body page.
Is there any framework there in flask? Dynamically include pages.
I don't want to refresh header, footer, menu.
