Hi everyone, i have been seeing this issue some days intermittently.
I have some methods with request.method = POST, but when i want to resend the same request to the same endpoint, there is an issue with the request.method and Flask throws Method not Allowed.
@app.route('/api/pause', methods=['POST'])
json = {"signature":"1234", "value":"b"}
The first time was good and data was printed on console: print request.json
but the second time (i am doing the requests from Postman and this time i have changed value for a) i can see this on log:
{"signature":"1234","value":"b"}POST /api/pause HTTP/1.1" 405 -
the third time i can see this on log:
{"signature":"1234","value":"a"}POST /api/pause HTTP/1.1" 405 -
So, i do not know why Flask is inserting the previous POST values at the request.method and of course it throws Method Not Allowed, because pause method has not this allowed.
Note: I tried with or without threaded Flask option.
Do you know why i have this problem ? It is so important because i can not create a good API without POST or PUT as you would think.
