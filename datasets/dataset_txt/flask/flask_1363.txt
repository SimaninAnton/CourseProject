Unfortunately, I have spent almost two hours altogether with tracking down a simple Attribute issue alongside others' time who were trying to kindly help me.
The problem is simply that I could not get the error message to fix a trivial issue. This is because I was trying to use the following these two lines to get debug messages based on the quick start:
if name == 'main':
application.run(debug=True)
... however this will not work with mod_wsgi, now I know.
Hereby, I suggest to improve the documentation by including this fact, and advise the use of the following instead:
application.debug = True
This will potentially save a lot of time for those users, and it is not an intrusive documentation addition either.
