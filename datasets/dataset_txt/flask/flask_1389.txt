It's my curse to discover documentation ambiguities ( even when they don't exist ) and then trip over them.
When I read, (step 2 of flaskr tutorial)
"Usually, it is a good idea to load a configuration from a configurable file. This is what from_envvar() can do, replacing the from_object() line above:
app.config.from_envvar('FLASKR_SETTINGS', silent=True)
That way someone can set an environment variable called FLASKR_SETTINGS to specify a config file to be loaded which will then override the default values. The silent switch just tells Flask to not complain if no such environment key is set."
I took that to mean, "Replace that 'from_object" instance. Well no. The text does not say that but I did anyway and debugged for a while until I removed the silent option, saw the noise and realized that that line would not work as described in this context.
It is a good point. Configuration files are good. I would box this into a "Note:" That concludes with a, "Do not replace this line now."
Simpler of course would be to omit entirely. Another alternative is to leave as a problem for the reader at the end of the section.
(Documentation is hard - there are too many personally costumized mental OS's out there to ever possibly fully debug docs)
