When you have a form and do the following action
def doaction:
     on POST 
          # dostuff
          return render_template('myform.html', success=1)

     on GET 
          # dostuff
          return render_template('myform.html', success=2)
You render the page, fill in the form and submit it. It returns the same template with a message : 'its ok'. If you are on the past rendered after the post, you do a browser refresh, you paste again.
This does not seem normal to me, or should we just include a hidden input alreadysubmitted or something, or redirect to another page
