This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
Expected Behavior
I should be able to log in just by session['profile'] = current_user
Before Flask 1.X I could login simply by adding a user profile returned by `auth0` to flask session.
Then check if session['profile'] is set to know if the user is logged in and who he is.
Actual Behavior
Tell us what happens instead.
I get: set_cookie() got an unexpected keyword argument 'samesite'
I've added to my config file the following:
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'
I've also tried with
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Strict'
Paste the full traceback if there was an exception.
