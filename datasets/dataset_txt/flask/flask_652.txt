Stack Overflow gets a constant stream of questions about 400 errors that are caused by missing keys. The fact that accessing args, form, files, values, session, and headers returns an HTTP error instead of a traceback is confusing to a lot of users; they get no feedback about what went wrong and it's easy to miss typos or a missing name attribute. This config should default to the value of DEBUG and the behavior should be much more clearly documented.
