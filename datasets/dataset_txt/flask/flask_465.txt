Is flask run supposed to spin up a TLS listener if the app is configured with TLS?
Take this app.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))
If i run python app.py i get the expected Listening on https://... and all is well - note the https.
If i run flask run i get an HTTP listener, Listening on http://.... No TLS.
Is this expected behaviour? May i suggest mentioning this somewhere in the quickstart? - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/
Would be great if someone would lay out the difference between the two invocations.
