Here is my code:
init.py:
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(_config.DevConfig)#Without this line, It works well.
import model_name.view
view.py:
@app.route('/')                                                                 
def index():                                                                                                                                    
    return render_template('index.html')
Problem:When I use method from_object. The index page can't be found. But when I deleted it, It works very well.
