Hello,
It's annoying to have to reimplement this snippet for every web app in order for url_for to work properly behind an nginx reverse proxy mounted on a sub folder of the host's root URL.
Could the not the functionality not be built into Flask by default?
Sorry for opening an issue instead of a PR, I don't think I have the expertise to modify Flask's code base.
Regards,
Eric.
