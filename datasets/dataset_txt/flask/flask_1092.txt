Hello all,
I just upgraded to Werkzeug 0.10, after which I install watchdog to get the new inotify reloader working to help reduce CPU usage on my laptop. However, the reloader no longer works (or at am minimum is random in what it detects).
To start debugging, I tried to run the sample watchdog code on their homepage (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog) in an iPython shell and initially got an error. It related to not being able to allocate inotify watches due to a system constraint. After upping the limit (echo "131072" >> /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches), I was able to run the code in the shell.
However, after that, the reloader still does not work. I am not sure what else I can do to help debug this, as watchdog seems to import correctly and my app does not throw any errors. Some diagnostic details:
