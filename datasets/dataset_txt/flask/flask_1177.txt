i am trying to get all errors as list.
i have BaseForm
from flask.ext.wtf import Form

class BaseForm(Form):
    @property
    def error_list(self):
        _errors = []
        for fieldName, errorMessages in self.errors.iteritems():
            _errors.extend(errorMessages)
        return _errors
my form class
from app.base_forms import *
from wtforms import StringField, TextField, PasswordField
import wtforms.validators as validators

class LoginForm(BaseForm):
    email    = StringField('Email Address', [ validators.Email(), validators.Required(message='Forgot your email address?')])
    password = PasswordField('Password', [ validators.Required(message='Must provide a password. ')])
def login(self):
    form = LoginForm()
    print  form.error_list
    print form.errors
    ...
this output form.errors
    "email": [
      "Forgot your email address?"
    ], 
    "password": [
      "Must provide a password. "
    ]
this output form.error_list
[
    "Must provide a password. ", 
]
Normally form has two errors but form.error_list return only one error that "Must provide a password."
what is the wrong.
How can i solve this problem?
