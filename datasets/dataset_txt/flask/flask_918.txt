There's several branches on this repo that are superfluous and should probably be deleted because they contain no additional commits and haven't been worked on in years.
For example:
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/json-sessions
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/flask_deployment_docs
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/appdispatch-docs
