Here's what fails http://paste.pocoo.org/show/202792/
The Flash section of the docs should at least mention that app.secret is required but I'm not sure that's enough.
One idea would be to require secret_key to be explicitly set and fail to run if it isn't.
For folks that don't need sessions they could pass a message to that effect to run().
My guess is session/flash will be used by more apps than not.
