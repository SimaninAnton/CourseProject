This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
