Many channels for distribution of documentation (Internet Archive, most libraries) find it easier to distribute the documentation if it is Creative Commons (CC) licensed - they aren't able to spend the time to read a custom license, even if it's just a modified Apache License. But for documentation only, there's really no difference between the Flask license and CC-BY http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
