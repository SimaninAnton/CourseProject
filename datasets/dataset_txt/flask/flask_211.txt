Hello,
This is directly related to the SO question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51379705/flask-auto-reload-does-not-refresh-browser
Expected Behavior
Upon changing an HTML template file while running the Flask development server, I thought the browser view would update to reflect the new HTML.
Actual Behavior
The browser view does not update upon changing an HTML template file. To see the HTML changes, the browser must be manually refreshed. I did not expect this to be the case. I am unsure if this is a bug or intended behavior of the Flask development server.
If this behavior is intended, I would like to have this considered for a Feature Request for the Flask development server.
Environment
Python version: 3.6.3
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
