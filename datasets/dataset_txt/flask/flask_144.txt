For example of passing via a Queue that does not work. https://github.com/HourGlss/FlaskSSE/blob/master/sse/sse.py
Expected Behavior
Session is a global variable
Actual Behavior
When passed via a queue the keys and associated values are dropped. When attempting to access globally, no keys are available even if they had been added by endpoints
Environment
Python version: 3.7
Flask version: Default install
Werkzeug version: Default install
