Expected Behavior
In debug mode, a very helpful call trace page comes up when an exception is thrown. Thanks for that!
A quick improvement would be to highlight the blocks which represent user's code. I believe this would give a decent speed boost when recognizing where errors come from. I think this could be as simple as giving a light red-tint on any code boxes which comes from the file defined in the FLASK_APP variable.
This would be unobtrusive, and would help speed up use for many users.
e.g. we could highlight this line:
Alternatively, the call trace could automatically collapse the 'app runner' code which the user is likely uninterested in.
Apologies if this place is for bugs only (not features)
