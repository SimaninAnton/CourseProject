Expected Behavior
Every time I call send file it should be sending the recently updated file.
# @app.route('/data/<file>-<key>', methods=['GET'])
def data_download(file, key):
    from flask import send_file
    # Reading the path from environment
    csvfile = os.environ['data_path']+"/{}".format(file)
    if key == "abc":
        return send_file(csvfile,
                         mimetype='text/csv',
                         attachment_filename=file,
                         as_attachment=True).
Actual Behavior
First time when this method is called it sends the latest file, however after that, if there are changes made in the file it's not sending the updated file it just sends the file containing same data as it had previously though the data is getting updated in the original file.
No exception it just does not sends the updated file.
Environment
Python version:3.6
Flask version:1.1.1
Werkzeug version:0.15.5
