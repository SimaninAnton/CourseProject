I'm testing the behavior of a POST endpoint that issues a redirect.
I get the following traceback:
env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py:1820: in wsgi_app
    response = self.make_response(self.handle_exception(e))

    AssertionError.__init__(self, ''.join(buf).encode('utf-8'))
E   TypeError: unbound method __init__() must be called with AssertionError instance as first argument (got FormDataRoutingRedirect instance instead)
I understand the context around why we need to raise FormDataRoutingRedirect - and don't mind asserting that it's raised in my test. The problem here is the TypeError: unbound method __init__() must be called with AssertionError.
I'll see if I can fix it a bit later but wanted to report it first. I checked the other reported issues.
I'm using Python 2.7.9 and Flask 0.10.1
