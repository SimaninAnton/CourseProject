from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch
from werkzeug.wsgi import DispatcherMiddleware
from frontend_app import application as frontend
from backend_app import application as backend

application = DispatcherMiddleware(frontend, {
    '/backend':     backend
})
In deployment environment, I can only reload both frontend and backend app.
