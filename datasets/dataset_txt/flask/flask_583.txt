Expected Behavior
I expected to be able to hand flask.request.stream to flask.json.load() in order to get a Python object back. flask.request.stream provides a bytes interface which the built-in python module doesn't like (it wants string) and the flask.json module has a couple of bits of code to work around this, so I expected it to work.
See attached file (reproduced here: https://gist.github.com/flexo/5cf4fde37f7b066fb6c7a77cb7416883 )

Actual Behavior
An exception is raised because LimitedStream has no 'readable' attribute. Possibly this makes it a bug in Werkzeug rather than Flask but since Flask provided the json module I thought it'd be best to report it here first.
