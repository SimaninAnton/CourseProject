Hi guys:
I wrote flask-bouncer, a authorization library based on RyanBates' CanCan ruby gem
docs: http://pythonhosted.org/flask-bouncer/
github: https://github.com/jtushman/flask-bouncer
pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-bouncer/0.1.11
Would love to have it listed in flask-registry. I hope it will be useful for the community.
Any feedback will be well received
Thanks!
