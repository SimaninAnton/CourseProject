The sweet web app console built into Firebug is easily accessible to JavaScript programmers via console.log(). The FireLogger extension lets server-side languages like PHP and Python write directly to the same console. In Python's case, via the FirePython module.
Unfortunately, Python integration is web-framework specific. Django is directly supported; Flask is not. FirePython already supports WSGI, so using it with Flask / Werkzeug should be straightforward. But it's not--at least not for me. The documentation basically says "read the source and figure it out." Given that I'm a complete novice with Flask's WSGI underpinnings, my efforts have flopped around without success.
So this is a request to those in the Flask community who are conversant with WSGI, Werkzeug, and logging to have a look and provide a recipe for how to link these individually great, but as yet not-talking-to-one-another, components. Looking at the code, I'd bet there's a <15 lines of code incantation that would do the trick; I just can't see the right permutation.
FWIW, this is the opposite of a one-off support request; easy Firebug logging would make an awesome app debugging facility for many Flask / webapp developers.
