I made a public (and open source) Docker image that you can use to build a Python Flask web application.
It has uWSGI for running the application, Nginx to serve HTTP and Supervisord to control them, so you don't have to learn how to install and configure all those to build your Python Flask web app.
It seems like uWSGI with Nginx is one of the more robust (and with great performance) ways to deploy a Python web app. Here are the benchmarks: http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers.
If there was an official Flask Docker image for deployment I would like to use it. But then, if there was an open source performant Docker image that could help deploying an app without having to learn, install and configure uWSGI, Nginx, Supervisord, I would have liked to find it in your docs.
Now that I built this one, you may want to include it in your docs, maybe as "a third party example" or something. If you think this could be useful, I could submit a PR.
I think it could be in deploying: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/
Or in snippet category deployment: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/category/deployment/
There are even some template projects you can use to bootstrap your own. And also, you don't have to clone the full project or something, you can just use it as a base image.
