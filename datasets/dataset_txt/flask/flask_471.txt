Regarding this documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#incoming-request-data
(Note: I'd just edit and PR myself, but I can't find these docs in this repo, or any instructions for contributing to it)
What mime-types does Flask recognize, and what does it do when it encounters them?
Reading data also reads stream, so if you call data and then stream, stream will be empty.
Similarly, reading stream before data results in an empty data
Sending a JSON payload in a GET request results in a populated form attribute (which, as per docs, only populates on POST and PUT)
These are very much not clear from the documentation, and led me to great frustration.
Note 2: Although it's reasonable that form does not automagically take JSON payloads and interpret them as form data.... it might be nice to point that out explicitly, given how much use JSON has.
