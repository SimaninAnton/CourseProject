Make endpoint an option in the @route decorator. By default it would still use the function name. This would allow more flexibility in larger applications:
def route(self, rule, **options):
    def decorator(f):
        endpoint = options.pop('endpoint', f.__name__)
        self.add_url_rule(rule, endpoint, **options)
        return f
    return decorator
