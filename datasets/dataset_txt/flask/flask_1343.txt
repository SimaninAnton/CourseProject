In the various tutorials test functions, the returned data is always accessed as if it was a str. In python 3.3, the results are binary, so they must be decoded:
Instead of:
assert "Some string" in rv.data
use:
assert "Some string" in rv.data.decode('utf-8')
(there are other ways too - encode the string constant, etc.).
