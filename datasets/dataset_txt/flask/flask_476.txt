I had a .flaskenv file for running an example, and when I tried to run the tests, one of them called app.run which called load_dotenv and changed the debug flag for future tests. Can also reproduce by just setting the env var and running in a terminal, without dotenv.
Need a pytest fixture to clear these vars at the beginning of the session, and to reset them after each test.
Working on this, just creating the issue for tracking.
