The comment in flask.Blueprint.errorhandler notes, "Please be aware that routing does not happen local to a blueprint so an error handler for 404 usually is not handled by a blueprint unless it is caused inside a view function."
Please add Blueprint-local routing for errors triggered by any request to an endpoint defined by a blueprint.
