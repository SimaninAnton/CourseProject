Assuming I have more than one Flask application (I'm using blueprints too, so there is not need to advice me them) and I want to build url from one to another. With no request context I was just using forced context of target application and it worked. But what should I do with existing request context? If i receive request to one application and want to do redirect to another one?
Or, in another words, why url_for first of all searches for request context? Maybe it should be optional, through _external parameter for example?
Please, do not send me to stackoverflow, my question about similar problem is hanging for more than a week with no responses at all.
