It should be possible to change the location/name of the static folder. A new keyword parameter to the package bound object should be added for that.
# just change the URL rule
module = Module(__name__, static_path='/_static')

# change the static folder's name and URL rule
module = Module(__name__, static_folder='media')
--> module = Module(__name__, static_path='/media', static_folder='media')

# a nested folder and it's URL rule:
module = Module(__name__, static_folder='assets/shared')
--> module = Module(__name__, static_path='/shared', static_folder='assets/shared')
Paths obviously relative to the root_path of the object.
