@rstacruz recently pointed me to the JSON security section of your documentation. It is irresponsible to pass off some sort of buggy browser behaviour (which probably doesn't even exist) as an inherent issue with using an array as the top-level object in a JSON document. The ecmascript 5 specification very clearly states:
Let array be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Array() where Array is the standard built-in constructor with that name.
Any browsers that behave as you say they should in your documentation are not following the spec. I tested for this behaviour in Chrome, Opera, and Firefox, and none of them behaved as was described. Because of that, I ask that you remove that section of the documentation and put in its place a disclaimer that what was there previously (for over a year now!) was not factual. If anyone does find this behaviour in any browser, report it instead in the proper place.
