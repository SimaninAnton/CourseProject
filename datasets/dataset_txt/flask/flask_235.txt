Expected Behavior
I had already config the variable "ENV" in the config, which was set as 'development', It seemed that the banner should display "Environment: development",actually,it didn't. What's more, it worked with env development.
# config
class Config:
    # ...
    @staticmethod
    def init_app(app):
        pass
class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    ENV='development'

def create_app(config_name):
    app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path='')

    app.config.from_object(config[config_name])
    config[config_name].init_app(app)
    # ...
    print("*Actual Environment: {}".format(app.config['ENV']))
    return app

# wsgi.py
from app import create_app

application = create_app('default')
Actual Behavior
 * Serving Flask app "wsgi.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
*Actual Environment:development
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
