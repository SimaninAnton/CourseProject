This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
Expected Behavior
Following the Tutorial step by step I received errors when testing HTTP requests.
The errors where caused for a missing 'WTF_CSRF_ENABLED' in the app config.
in file conftest.py changed the create_app to:
app = create_app({
'TESTING': True,
'DATABASE': db_path,
'WTF_CSRF_ENABLED': False # this solved the problem
})
Paste a minimal example that causes the problem.
Actual Behavior
Tell us what happens instead.
Paste the full traceback if there was an exception.
Environment
Python version: 3.7
Flask version: 1.0.2
