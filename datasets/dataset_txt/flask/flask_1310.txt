Since heroku is one of the recommended quickstart deployment options, after following the (great) flaskr tutorial I tried to deploy on heroku only to realize some hours later that heroku does not support sqlite3 and thus the flaskr tutorial will never deploy on heroku with 500 Internal Service Errors. Perhaps this should be mentioned in the Flaskr tutorial, as other beginners may also follow both official documentation suggestions to failure.
