Error message:
d:\projects\cfblog2_env\scripts\python.exe: can't open file 'D:\projects\cfblog2_env\Scripts\flask': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Environment: Win 10, Py 3.5.2(VirtualEnv)，Flask 0.11
This error was came from '_reload.py' in werkzeug.It seems like when run with flask.exe, sys.executable still equal to python's exe path and sys.argv is something like this:'D:\\projects\\cfblog2_env\\Scripts\\flask', 'run'
I am not sure what cause this problem actually(werkzeug,packer of flask.exe or flask itself).But this error happend when I using flask. So I put the issuse here.
To whom has the same error, you can usepython -m flask run for workaround.
And last, sorry for my poor english.
