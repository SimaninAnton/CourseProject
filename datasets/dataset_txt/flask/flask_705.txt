Sorry to post this here as it is probably a question as opposed to an issue, but my query on stackoverflow yielded no answers. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40666325/flask-application-starts-without-giving-debugging-pin-also-no-request-info-disp
Any suggestions how to debug this would be appreciated.
