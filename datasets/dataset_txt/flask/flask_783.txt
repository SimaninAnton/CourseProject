Locally(within the cloud instance ) being able to create the server and access from browser using localhost.But when trying to access the flask application outside the instance it fails to connect.The port used was 8217.So I created another server on Nodejs on the same port and then the node application is accessible outside the instance with the public IP. Also to ensure I thought that the problem might be only with my python,so to validate it I tried creating a naked server using HTTPServer and it worked fine. Not sure what is going wrong here.Any help?
