It would be great to have access to the functionality of app.cli.command via blueprints - i.e. something like:
blueprint = Blueprint('myblueprint', __name__,)

@blueprint.cli.command()
def doblueprintstuff():
    """Initialize the database."""
    #....
It would help a lot when building modular applications.
