At this time, Flask.run() accepts only a host= parameter containing a single address. While :: for the Linux kernel also accepts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses from the ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96 range, other dual stack implementations, such as Windows (and OpenBSD I think) do not map IPv4 addresses into the IPv6 address space for (IMHO sound) security rationales.
Please support binding to multiple addresses, thus supporting dual stack deployment, such as host=('0.0.0.0', '::').
