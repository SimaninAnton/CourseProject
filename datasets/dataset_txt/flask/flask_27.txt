Expected Behavior
Static file from under static path should be served if it has UTF-8 encoded characters in its name.
I'm running Flask in combination with Gunicorn. Although my ubuntu system encoding is UTF-8 it doesn't seem to behave correctly.
# simple file name:
42%C3%A9.jpg
Actual Behavior
I get a 404 status code
Environment
Python version: 3.6.8
