[sorry for my english]
sometime, my flask app return page with very slow latency time.(10s~20s)

my code is very simple and it takes times under 0.01s
so i try to strace command and i found this
command: strace -tt python main.py
23:01:29.815894 recvfrom(4, "", 8192, 0, NULL, NULL) = 0 <- take 20s
23:01:49.059271 close(4) = 0
