You are using pip version 18.0, however version 18.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
i followed 20 posts on this issue, and no matter what i do, i can't get around the 404 Not Found issue.
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = "127.0.0.1:5000" # attempting to set explicitly, as it defaults to None 

app.route('/')
def home():
    return "home..."

print('server name ', app.config["SERVER_NAME"])

app.run(debug=True)
tried specifying port, using default, specifying server name, using default.. console prints the url to use but that default url does not work
