In py3, response.data returns a byte value, meaning you can't do if 'foo' in response.data in tests, for example.
Currently, the best way to get the response body as a string seems to be response.get_data(as_string=True), which is a bit tedious.
Maybe add a response.text property? That's what the requests package seems to have done.
