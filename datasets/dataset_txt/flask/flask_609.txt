Hi, I'm reading the docs and working on code at the same time with somewhat narrow windows.
The Flask docs have a big sidebar on the left that is not always useful, and worse the body text has a fixed width that pushes it off the right side of the page. Makes it very hard to read without constantly scrolling.
Doesn't fit in with old-school html wrapping or new responsive hotness. Disabling:
div.document {
 /* width: 940px; */
}
with the dev tools fixed the width problem, responsive css could disable the sidebar when the window is narrow. Cheers,
