I was lazily loading views in 0.9, and some views needed to use the same function, e.g.
url('/<lang:lang>/blog/', 'blog.views.blog_index', defaults={'page': 1})
url('/<lang:lang>/blog/page/<int:page>', 'blog.views.blog_index')
Upon updating Flask to 0.10.1, I now get the following error:
AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function
The cause is the same as #796, but your current documentation still says this is a valid way of having a central URL map.
Is there a way around this, beyond just storing every single LazyView in a dict and looking it up each time url() is called? The above documentation needs to be updated to reflect the answer.
