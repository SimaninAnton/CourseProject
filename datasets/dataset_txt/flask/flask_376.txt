Hello,
this may not be issue but please help me..
I have solved the task getting lang code in URL some weeks ago and may anyone confirm it is relevant and good for any project ?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49496761/two-language-flask-site-with-or-without-blueprints
I have a problem using URLs in HTML
How is it relevant to use Blueprint URLs in HTML ?
for example:
<a href="/{{sess_lang}}/home/hale/">Home</a>
I have to insert lang_code before Blueprint URL to go to the right page
or
<a href="home/hale/">Home</a>
I have to use URL without first slash ?!
In general this Blueprint must be main blueprint but I have to develop bigger App than any simple site and need help for such configuration about URLs ..
In addition I will be getting translations from Mongodb collection and need to switch language on any page without redirecting to any other page...
In addition can I change language without JS only with get request ? need example..
