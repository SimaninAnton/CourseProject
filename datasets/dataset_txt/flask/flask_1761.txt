Currently it's not possible to configure the static_dir or the templates_dir of an application instance, because the Jinja environment and the static directory are configured on instantiation.
I would suggest to split the jinja_env and static middleware configuration in a separate method "def setup_env(self):" and call this method from init (depending on a boolean flag).
Then it could be used like this:
app = Flask(__name__, setup_env=False)
app.templates_dir = 'funny_templates'
app.setup_env()
But if it makes no sense, just close the request: finally I did it differently.
