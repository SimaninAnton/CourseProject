Hello everybody.
Please, forgive my poor english, and do not get me wrong, my question is not malicious.
Actually, are any plans to reach version 1.0? Or at least reach a new version?
1.0, or a more fluid release versions can be a way to attract more users and developers.
Greetings, and thanks for the work you do in Flask.
