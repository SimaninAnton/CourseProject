I was following the tutorial, and got to the bottom of the page, where it says
Try clicking the “Register” button without filling out the form and see that the browser shows an error message.
Expected Behavior
I was expecting to see an error message in the browser
Actual Behavior
I don't see an error message - instead, it seems to already work beautifully:
Environment
Python 3.7.4
Flask 1.1.1
Werkzeug 0.16.0
