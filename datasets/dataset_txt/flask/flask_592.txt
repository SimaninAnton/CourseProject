If you don't install your app in the env, you have to append .py in the FLASK_APP var.
Haven't dug into why it's like this yet, but it might be more straightforward to add the cwd to PYTHONPATH so that FLASK_APP=app.py becomes FLASK_APP=app even if the app isn't installed in the env.
We can still support paths to set the cwd. FLASK_APP=/path/to/app would set the current directory to /path/to then try to import app.
