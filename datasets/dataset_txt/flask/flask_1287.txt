Can someone please take a look at this issue in Flask-gzip? Just using flask and flask-gzip, but getting this error after upgrading from 0.9 to 0.10.1
closeio/Flask-gzip#7
this did, however, make the error go away:
@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    response.direct_passthrough = False
    return response
