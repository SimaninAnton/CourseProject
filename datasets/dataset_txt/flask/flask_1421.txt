Why isn't request.data of type unicode? The following test application reveals that the type is str.
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def index():
    return str(type(request.data))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
This is an issue if, for example, I have a Flask application that receives a JSON string as request data, then attempts to insert that data into a database that requires a unicode value.
