Expected Behavior
Each published version of the "Flask Extensions" docs page should have a valid link to scripts/flaskext_compat.py under the "Flask Before 0.8" section.
Links:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensions/
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/extensions/
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/extensions/
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/extensions/
Actual Behavior
Each version of the docs points to scripts/flaskext_compat.py on Flask's master branch on GitHub. Since that file was removed from the current master branch via 715a9a3, all of the links to this script are broken.
For example, the docs for the version 0.12 uses this URL, which results in a 404:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallets/flask/master/scripts/flaskext_compat.py
Also, the master branch version of the docs still show how to use this script that's been removed:
https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/docs/extensions.rst
Environment
Viewing different versions of Flasks docs on flask.pocoo.org in Google Chrome 64 on Windows 10.
