Sentry has this for example, and they simply run uWSGI (which can be installed via pip); configured with sane defaults through environment variables: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/services/http.py
I think this would make sense for Flask too since it'd make simple use cases easier (people just wanting to run a small application without having to configure much).
This could be done in a separate standalone package providing a new cli command instead of having it in the Flask core, but I think having an issue here is a good idea anyway in case someone is looking for something to contribute.
