Earlier this year I did some development involving Server-sent events (SSE) using Flask. I found there is no official documentation on how to best handle this. Since the specification is simple I ended up implementing it myself. However, I think there is room for improvement.
I find there are a couple of problems with working with SSE and Flask:
Development environment requires using a separate service or threading. Using a separate service adds complexity and using threading disallows the use of frame inspection in the built-in Don't Panic debugger for all requests.
There is no official information on best practices when it comes to deployment of SSE. Should it be a separate service or can it be included in the application? Especially for smaller applications I find the complexity of introducing a separate service for managing SSE adds a lot of complexity to an otherwise simple project.
The same points hold true for WebSockets as they are similar.
