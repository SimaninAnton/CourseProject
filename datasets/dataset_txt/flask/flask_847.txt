The loading of template tried too much times(count of blueprints), after setting with EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING config.
Maybe Blueprint.render_template is more effective.
In huge application, there are too much Blueprints, the performance is important.
An independent module should always use independent template and Blueprint. Just like below in a view.py
mod = Blueprint('standalone', __name__, url_prefix='/evil', \
  template_folder='standalone/templates', \
  static_folder='standalone/static')

@mod.route('/')
def index():
    # add a function into Blueprint
    return mod.render_template('index.html')
