Running OS X Yosemite.
I had the dev server running and was toggling the debug option. i.e. app.debug={True, False} in my entry-point file. I started running without debug and was surprised that the server was loading changes I made to my templates without having to restart the server. This is the reason I was toggling the option. Though, this is not the issue, since I later learned that that was the correct behavior.
In any case, I proceeded to then set debug to True and save the entry-point file. I may have restarted the server at this point, but either way things were still running regularly. However, trouble ensued when I then commented the line setting debug to True (thus leaving it set to the default False value) and saved. After this, I restarted the server, but was met with a traceback ending in:
...
File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 224, in meth
    return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)
socket.error: [Errno 48] Address already in use
I restarted the server multiple times, before and after relaunching the Terminal app, and was met with this traceback each time. From this I suspected the server process was still running and had been orphaned. Using Activity Monitor, I found a python process running and terminated it. After that, when I tried running the dev server, I received a smaller (though similarly-ending) traceback. (not sure what to conclude from receiving a different traceback)
I didn't get to do much more testing after that. I came to GitHub to begin documenting the bug when my MacBook suddenly restarted. I can't say the restart is related to this issue. However, the restart was due to an OS X panic relating to OSXFuse. I've never had an OS X panic since updating to Yosemite, so I find a correlation to the dev server issue possible.
