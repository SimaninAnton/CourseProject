Just merged pallets/werkzeug#1416 so Werkzeug's reloader detects python -m module correctly. All of flask.cli.main() can be replaced with:
def main(as_module=False):
    cli.main(prog_name="python -m flask" if as_module else None)
Need to wait until Werkzeug 0.15 has been out for a bit before we can bump Flask's min version.
