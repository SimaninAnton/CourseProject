After cloning this repository with git and you run "git fsck" there are multiple errors:
Checking object directories: 100% (256/256), done. warning in tree 0b404df8c030cdeaca7b373956c3a697efd32f78: contains zero-padded file modes warning in tree 51ea366fd4253b3a618289dc1c0c4bb16a3c2a22: contains zero-padded file modes warning in tree 679afdb340e9e1011927b52d2cd48bd221159131: contains zero-padded file modes warning in tree 77c7430020693d35500ca4fc292cff63fc3e672b: contains zero-padded file modes warning in tree 6a37da079f3bed362608b2558b162617c0c3af5c: contains zero-padded file modes Checking objects: 100% (12634/12634), done.
This prevents the repository from being push'ed to another git server, for example:
Counting objects: 12435, done. Delta compression using up to 8 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (3696/3696), done. remote: error: object 0b404df8c030cdeaca7b373956c3a697efd32f78: zeroPaddedFilemode: contains zero-padded file modes remote: fatal: Error in object error: pack-objects died of signal 13
I suggest the repository is rebuilt to correct the corruption in it.
