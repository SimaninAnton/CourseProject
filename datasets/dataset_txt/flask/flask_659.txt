Sometimes you need key-value pairs in your query params, and at those times it would be nice to have a built-in support. Here's what I've seen some APIs use, which looks reasonable to me:
http://example.com/api/search?name=Markus&hobby[football]=1&hobby[basketball]=0
Which would construct request.args like so:
{
    'name': 'Markus',
    'hobby': {
        'football': 1,
        'basketball': 0,
    }
}
