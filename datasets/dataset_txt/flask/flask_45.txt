I just upgraded the macOS to 10.15 (Catalina) on my MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) and encountered a weird issue:
I'm running a python flask app on local area network which worked fine before the upgrade, but other people could not access to my server now;
With Wireshark, I know the TCP SYN requests was received but not responded; And the flask server did not received the request at all;
I started a simple TCP server with a python script in terminal. By allowing Python.app to access to the network on a pop-up, this simple TCP server could be connected by others;
If I turn down the firewall on macOS, the flask server could be connected by others;
In the firewall configuration, the Python was allowed to access to the network; And there was no pop-ups to allow the network access when I started the flask app;
Anything i missed?
Environment
macOS 10.15
Python version: 3.7.2
Flask version: 0.12.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
