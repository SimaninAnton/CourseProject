I'm not sure there is a kind of convention in url_prefix for registering blueprint. If not, It behaves weird.
I'd made cs-log app and register it on app.py like this.
app.register_blueprint(
  inventory_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/inventory-info')
app.register_blueprint(
  custom_query_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/custom_query')
app.register_blueprint(
  cs_log_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/cs-log')
and try to approach to cs-log, flask give me a 404 error. After a few of try to fixing it, I've changed an order of registering like this.
app.register_blueprint(
  inventory_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/inventory-info')
app.register_blueprint(
  cs_log_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/cs-log')
app.register_blueprint(
  custom_query_views.blueprint,
  url_prefix='/v1/<project_uuid>/<app_name>/custom_query')
then it works I expected. Did I miss something? I think underbar in url_prefix of customer_query_views affect to url_prefix with hyphen.
If something can't understand in my article, reply me.
