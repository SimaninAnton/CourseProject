Hi,
I just downloaded the sourcecode for the AJAX with jQuery example (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/jquery/).
When i try and run index.html, it gives me an error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined" for index.html:5.
For layout.html, it gives 2 errors:
"GET http://localhost/templates/script.js" for layout.html:5
"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {" for layout.html:7
Consequently, the example doesn't work as no result is generated if you put 2 numbers in the input boxes.
Cheers
