The suggested way to start the app from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#a-minimal-application is app.run(...). Examining the source code of run, which chains run_simple it appears there is now way to detect success or failure.
Perhaps the run method should return a status (True/False) or (self/None)
