itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=http://tietie-static.qiniudn.com/downloads/TieTie_iOS.plist becomes
itms-services:?action=download-manifest&url=http://tietie-static.qiniudn.com/downloads/TieTie_iOS.plist when using redirect(url_here)
get_wsgi_headers will be called in after_request callback, so nothing works even I make redirect response by hand...
set autocorrect_location_header to False also not work
