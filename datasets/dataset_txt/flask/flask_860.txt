Continuing discussion from #1729
Should Flask shell natively support iPython?
If so, what should that API look like?
Should Flask have a generic hook for extensions to add support for additional third-party shells?
If so, how would this work? @RonnyPfannschmidt suggested using entry points for this.
My vote is to natively support for iPython since it's so popular (I use it myself all the time via Flask-Script). But draw the line there and require other custom shell integrations to happen through third-party extensions.
