This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
Expected Behavior
Create a file called frozenAccount.py to import the file and call the same name function defined in the file.
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute'frozenAccount'.
Replace the file name with others, and the program can be executed normally. So why can't this name be?
Or because it's a reserved wordï¼Ÿ
Actual Behavior
Tell us what happens instead.
Paste the full traceback if there was an exception.
Environment
Python version:2.7.13
Flask version:0.12.2
