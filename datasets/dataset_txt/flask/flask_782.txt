running py.test on the tests folder, I get a few failures
test_safe_join and test_safe_join_exceptions both fail.
The first one fails with a 'TypeError: safe_join() missing 1 required positional argument: 'filename'
The second fails with a 'TypeError: safe_join() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given'
Also
test_send_file_last_modified fails.
'rv.last_modified' is None. Hence, 'assert rv.last_modified == datetime.datetime(1999,1,1,0,0) fails
I'm somewhat of a amatuer programmer so maybe it's just me :)
