Please comment if the attached workflow is a correct description of how Flak handles an request and when and how signals are triggered
I'm particularly interested in the request_tearing_down signal. I want to log requests (user page views) to a database, but I don't want to compromise the client experience regarding speed. So I would like to only log the request data to a DB after the data was successfully sent to the client
