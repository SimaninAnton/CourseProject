Jsonify doesn't work with streaming in flask.
If I have a generator in a method that calls yield jsonify({'test':'test'})
and I call the generator with
return Response(stream_with_context(generator()), mimetype='application/json')
then flask throws an error saying application must write bytes.
For now I have resorted to using plain python json.dumps(dict)
