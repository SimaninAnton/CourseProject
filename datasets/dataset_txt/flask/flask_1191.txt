I use a flask server to serve static files from a server but once in a while the server becomes completely unresponsive, downloading a file keeps loading but never downloads. When I opened up the terminal, I found some weird requests, I hit CTRL + C and the server immediately becomes responsive again and downloads continue. This happens every so often and I have no idea what's causing this and how to prevent it from freezing my flask server, is this someone trying to hack?
