As I am trying to understand how different apps servers and libraries deal with invalid Cookie inside the "Cookie header" (see https://github.com/dorfsmay/Invalid_cookies_in_Cookie_header ), I realised that Flask is munging the invalid cookie with the next one, together:
curl -b 'SID=31d4d96e407aad42; muffin ; lang=en-US;' localhost:8080
==> {'SID': '31d4d96e407aad42', 'muffin ; lang': 'en-US'}
I'm sure this was not the desired behaviour, wouldn't it better to just ignore any string between semi-colons that cannot be translated into a valid cookie (so any string without an equal sign)?
