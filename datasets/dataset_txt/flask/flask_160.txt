Ask help for my demo
Hey, guys. I deploy the simple demo on my server, and then use 'export FLASK_APP=demo.py' , 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0' to launch the program.
However, I have tried every possible way to visit my web page, but failed all the same. It shows time out. I'm waiting sincerely for your help!!
My code:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
   return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run( host='0.0.0.0',port=5000)
Note:
I am sure there firewall(iptables) is closed on my server.
I used Chrome to visit the web page, and got the result time out.
