I found the tutorial rather confusing in how it gives the same name to three different things: the top-level directory of the project, the subdirectory containing all project-specific code (the package directory?), and the main .py script. In many spots in the tutorial, we set variables to the value "flaskr" (in setup.py and in environment variables) and we import from .flaskr as well. Maybe this is common practice in making flask applications or python apps in general, but I think for beginners it might help to rename some of these to make it clearer which "flaskr" is being referenced in setup.py, init.py, environment variables, etc. Thank you.
