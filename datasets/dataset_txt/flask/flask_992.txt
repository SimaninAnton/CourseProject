In the docs the section The Status of Python 3 states that you strongly recommend using Python 2.6 and 2.7.
Well, isn't it about time to officially recommend to use Python 3 instead? Has this been discussed before (recently)?
I myself at least never ran in any problems using Python 3 with Flask. Though, admittedly, I don't have any large projects or unusual dependencies - or maybe I just instinctively avoid anything that's not Python 3 compatible and thus never noticed problems.
Still, it seems to me that a recommendation to Python 3 is reasonable, unless you have special dependencies, and it doesn't look to me that there are many (active) Flask-* packages that require Python 2.
