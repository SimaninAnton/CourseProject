Hellow. I know that this platform is for bag-tracking and i'm so sorry to write here about my silly question. But my question on stackoverflow was mostly ignored and i tried to find a way to write to you cause i often see your answers there and I really need help. Moreover, it seems to me that for you it's just a couple of minute to solve that question. Pls, just take a look on in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51687362/how-can-i-edit-data-fetched-from-db-in-html-table-flask-jinja2.
