Right now ExtensionName==dev is required to be approved however supporting that turns out to be surprisingly hard if you have changing repository URLs. We should either drop this requirement or provide a script that updates all existing descriptions with new names.
Right now a lot of Pocoo stuff itself does not support ==dev.
