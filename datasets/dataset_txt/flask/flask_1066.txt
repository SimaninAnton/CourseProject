Is there a way to add a global catch-all error handler in which I can change the response to a generic JSON response?
I can't use the got_request_exception signal, as it is not allowed to modify the response (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/signals/).
In contrast all signal handlers are executed in undefined order and do not modify any data.
I would prefer to not wrap the app.handle_exception function as that feels like internal API. I guess I'm after something like:
@app.errorhandler()
def handle_global_error(e):
  return "Global error"
Note the errorhandler does not take any parameters, meaning it would catch all exceptions/status codes which does not have a specific error handler attached to them. I know I can use errorhandler(500) to catch exceptions, but if I do abort(409) for example, it will still return a HTML response.
