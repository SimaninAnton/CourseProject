There is currently no documentation for how to "officially" test Flask CLI commands. It seems appropriate that there should be a section about it on this page: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/.
I know there was a previous issue (#1709) that got closed, but I do believe it is an issue that there is no documentation on this very important topic. Furthermore, it is also very hard to find information about how to do it online (that old issue is literally the only page I found that is relevant).
