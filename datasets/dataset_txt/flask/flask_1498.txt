How can I get the raw data from a POST request in Flask?
I am moving from web.py to Flask and have some clients in production that unfortunately are using the content-type header application/x-www-form-urlencoded, so changing the header value of the request is not an option (unless it is overwritten on the server)
I cannot use: data = request.form.keys()[0] Because occasionally the '&' character shows up in my data and trying to loop through the form.keys adding the '&' seems to corrupt the data for some reason.
I'm currently using the solution proposed in this post: Python (Flask): How to get whole raw post body? But I'm not too sure if this has any performance issues.
I'm looking for one of three things:
Confirmation that the WGSICopyBody method won't have any adverse performance issues
Ability to make this (data = request.form.keys()[0]) method work by looping through the keys and properly restoring the & in the data
Another solution to the problem, possibly by subclassing the Request class?
