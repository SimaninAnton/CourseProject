Okay, so I got an application running on 127.0.0.1:62781.
I'm redirecting all traffic to this port, via htaccess.
Everything works quite well. Except for the automatic route redirect that kicks in if you have specified routes like these:
@app.route('/users/', defaults={'page': 1})
@app.route('/users/page/<int:page>')
def show_users(page):
    pass
Of course, I'm mostly using url_for, so it's not a huge problem, but if a user visits /users/page/1, he should get redirected to /users, but instead flask wants to send him to 127.0.0.1:62781/users.
How can I prevent that from happening?
I tried it with gunicorn and the "standard" run.py that looks like this:
import lesetagebuch.main as main
main.app.run(
    host='0.0.0.0',
    port=62781
)
