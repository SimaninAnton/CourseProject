having 'example.com' and 'example.org' running on the same server with the same data backend I thought it would be simple to serve both from a single Flask app, especially since Werkzeug has host_matching but it isn't.
I currently workaround this by 'injecting' hostname into urls with nginx's url rewrites but this is a bit too hackish, you know.
I would like to have syntax like this:
@app.route("/", host="example.org")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
