Currently missing attributes of template variables are swallowed by Flask, even
in debug mode:
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # template contains:
    # {{ lol.asdf }}
    return flask.render_template('lol.htm', lol=3)
I propose we set app.jinja_env.undefined to some type that logs warnings to
console when Flask's debug mode is enabled.
