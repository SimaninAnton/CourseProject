Currently, Request.get_json is hardcoded to only accept JSON requests with a media type of application/json. There are a plethora of emerging JSON media types and it would be handy to be able to configure the application with a set of acceptable JSON media types.
A probably half brained idea is to change the conditional statement inside Request.get_json to something like:
json_mimetypes = _request_ctx_stack.top.app.config.get('JSON_MIMETYPES', ('application/json',))

if self.mimetype not in json_mimetypes and not force:
    return None
