The Larger Applications docs recommend creating a runserver.py as follows:
from yourapplication import app
app.run(debug=True)
This runs counter to the advice in the Development Server doc for working with the flask run command â€” the app.run() call should be under if __name__ == '__main__'.
That makes it work properly, anyway. But when using flask run, the runserver.py file can be removed altogether.
