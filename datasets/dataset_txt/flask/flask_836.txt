http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.register_blueprint
The documentation doesn't list or explain any of the arguments used by flask.Flask.register_blueprint.
It only says:
register_blueprint(*args, **kwargs)Â¶
Registers a blueprint on the application.

New in version 0.7.
For one, I know there should be at least use_prefix and maybe (or surely) more than that.
Note: All Flask version's documentation seems to be affected by this.
