I found myself jumping to google to learn how to activate the debugger. Perhaps if the screen grab showed & highlighted the console icon on the far left of my screen, that wouldn't have happened.
I'm happy to submit a pull request with a replacement screenshot if you agree this would be useful, noting I'm not on mac, so screen grab might look out of place, if that detail is considered important
