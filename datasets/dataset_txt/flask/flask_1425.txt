Hello.
I want to propose my small extension flask-mongo-sessions to review for approval.
The aim of the extension is to provide your sites with server-side sessions stored in MongoDB.
The project lives here. Documentation and PyPI package are available.
If something is wrong, I'll be glad to receive a feedback.
Regards,
Ivan.
