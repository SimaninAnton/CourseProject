If the path specified in FLASK_APP does not exist (for example it is a typo), then the unhelpful error message is shown:
ImportError: Import by filename is not supported.
This is even though I have:
FLASK_APP=alex/server2.py
which is "path-like" and not module like.
Perhaps this line should be modified to return True for file-like objects.
