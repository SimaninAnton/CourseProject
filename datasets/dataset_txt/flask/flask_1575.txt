I just read this blog post: http://wekeroad.com/2011/10/24/a-fun-little-json-murder-mystery-with-ie9/
It mentions that IE9 requires json responses to have a proper charset set for it to parse it correctly. I looked at what my API currently does (which uses jsonify) and it does not set the charset at all.
I might be missing something but I think that it should set it.
