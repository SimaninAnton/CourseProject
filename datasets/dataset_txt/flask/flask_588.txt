I found that using send_file() to serve video (mp4) files works fine but the same content is not served using send_from_directory(). Only small parts (hundreds of bytes) are delivered to browser.
On Firefox video embedded through <video> tags is playable in most cases but opened directly from address bar not. On Chrome both methods are not working.
With x-sendfile switched off, send_from_directory() works ok.
Tested on:
Debian: python 3.5.3, flask 0.12.2, apache 2.4.25, mod_wsgi 4.5.11
Ubuntu: python 3.5.2, flask 0.12.2, apache 2.4.18, mod_wsgi 4.3.0
