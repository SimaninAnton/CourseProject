This is a major backwards-compat breaking change, but I suspect not the intended design and hopefully easy to fix.
The issue is related to PR #2629, and this example follows from that:
Given blueprint bp and app app:
@bp.route('b/')
def tmp():
    return "URI should be '/a/b/"

app.register_blueprint(bp, url_prefix='/a/')
In Flask 0.12 the URL is correctly /a/b, but in Flask 1.0 it's /ab.
Since issue #2629 relates to resolve double-slashes, I imagine this is a bug (and not a design decision) - and the correct solution would be to remove a slash only when there are two.
