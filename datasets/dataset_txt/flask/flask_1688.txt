url_for is currently the wrong way round compared to absolute imports. This also makes converting into larger applications hard when you suddenly introduce modules and a few views on the application itself remain (eg: static exports). The problem with "reversing" is that it breaks current code, so at the very least it should be an option.
We also have to investigate how many extensions this would affect.
