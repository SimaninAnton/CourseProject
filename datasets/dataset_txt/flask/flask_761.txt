I have a def that looks like this
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template('main.html')
When trying to call this def I get
TypeError: index() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given
Most examples I've found doesn't pass any parameters into the def so I'm not sue why I have too? How can I go about using my def without passing in parameters?
So for whatever reason I have to pass in 2 arguments for gunicorn so I change my code to look like this:
@app.route("/")
def index(arg1, arg2):
    return render_template('main.html')
After passing in 2 parameters I get:
/python3.4/site-packages/flask/templating.py", line 132, in render_template
    ctx.app.update_template_context(context)

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'app'
It appears by using gunicorn it doesn't appear it's setting up the correct context to use templates. How would I go about setting up the 'app` context?
