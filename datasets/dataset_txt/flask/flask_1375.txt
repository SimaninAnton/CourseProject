Currently, the run() method of the Flask object takes as parameters the host, the port, the debug mode, and some options (like the reloader mode).
It would be cool to add a server parameter that will be set default to Werkzeug's run_simple() function but could be another one like Gunicorn.
To run an application with our choice server, we could do:
application.run(host=0.0.0.0, port=5000, server='gunicorn')
This is mostly a «shortcut» than a real feature. If you have any cons (or pros, why not), please tell me :)
