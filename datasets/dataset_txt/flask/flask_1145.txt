flask/blob/master/docs/patterns/fileuploads.rst, after the first bit of sample code, says:
"Then we add a URL rule by hand to the application."
But I see no place in that code where a URL rule is added.
Expected: Either a URL rule is added in that piece of code, or the text doesn't state that that happens.
