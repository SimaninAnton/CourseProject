flask.session imports MutableMapping from collections which is deprecated in Python 3.7 and will be removed in 3.8. For some reason since there are similar warnings in other libraries like werkzeug and jinja that are fixed seems to hide this warning. Importing session directly from flask folder causes this warning
Expected Behavior
DeprecationWarning should not be shown since it causes incompatibility with 3.8
Actual Behavior
Tell us what happens instead.
