I want to translate latest Flask documentation to Russian language. I searched in the Google, and found this page: https://flask-russian-docs.readthedocs.io/ru/latest/. It is good russian translation, but it is bit outdated. I want to renew it, and continue to maintain.
But then I encountered an issue (#1023) about the Korean language, so I want to ask:
OK, you can't check translation because you don't have any russian developers, so you can't make it as official translation.
But then, what I (and other translators) can do? Can you give a link to that translation, and say, that this is unofficial? Can I search for russian developers on some other sites and ask them to check translation? What if I translate docs commit-by-commit, so you will always see, is it new or outdated? So, if I want to translate it "right-way", how can I do it?
