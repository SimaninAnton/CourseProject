Hello, I'm new to Python and Flask so bare with me. I'm using Windows 8, PyCharm, Python 2.7.4, and Flask 0.10.
I followed the documentation to create the Flaskr application which is working great! So then I moved on to the unit testing application and began following the instructions.
I created a new module as instructed, copied and pasted the example code, and then ran python flaskr_tests.py and got the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "flaskr_tests.py", line 2, in
import flaskr
ImportError: No module named flaskr
I did everything as described but yet get this error? I went back and checked everything and still can't figure out what I'm missing?
