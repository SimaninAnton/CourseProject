I just upgraded to Flask 1.0.2 and my code (which was working):
from http.client import MOVED_PERMANENTLY

@app.errorhandler(MOVED_PERMANENTLY)
def error_handler(err):
    print(err)
now fails with:
 mod_wsgi (pid=66451): Target WSGI script 'app.py' cannot be loaded as Python module.
 mod_wsgi (pid=66451): Exception occurred processing WSGI script 'app.py'.
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "app.py", line 128, in <module>
     @app.errorhandler(MOVED_PERMANENTLY)
   File "python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 1316, in decorator
     self._register_error_handler(None, code_or_exception, f)
   File "python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 66, in wrapper_func
     return f(self, *args, **kwargs)
File "python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 1349, in _register_error_handler
" HTTPException with that code instead.".format(code_or_exception)
KeyError: "'301' is not a recognized HTTP error code. Use a subclass of HTTPException with that code instead."
Am I doing something wrong?
