When running a development server, using flask run, with the SERVER_NAME config variable set to a port number other than 5000, the server still defaults to 5000. Looking into the code, it seems that flask.cli.run_command calls werkzeug.serving.run_simple directly, without passing through Flask.run, where the code for processing the server name resides.
This is using python 3.5, and Werkzeug 0.11.11
