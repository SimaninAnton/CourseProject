I have tests that make multiple requests. After each test I'd like to pop the application context so it mimics the production environment as close as possible. Basically I'm looking to prevent any persistence in g between requests.
What is the least painful way of implementing this?
Sample test:
def test(self):
    user_get = self.client.get('user')
    # pop context
    jobs_get = self.client.get('jobs')
