In the example for MethodView, post() will not be called unless methods is set on the class or with add_url_rule
https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/flask/views.py#L123
A fix might be having MethodView.methods set to a copy of http_method_funcs i.e. all available methods
If I am missing something here my apologies
