requesting without {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
request.get_json(force=True) returns nothing (not as expected)
request.get_json(force=False) returns None (not as expected)
requesting with {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
request.get_json(force=True) returns the JSON parsed to dict
request.get_json(force=False) returns the JSON parsed to dict
Expected behavior:
Shouldn't request.get_json(force=True) like mentioned in the docs "Ignore the mimetype and always try to parse JSON."?
thx, and keep up the great work
