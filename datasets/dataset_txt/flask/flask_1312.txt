Hello,
Just noticed that the default HTML errors (like 404 Not Found) are:
Not using HTML5 yet.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
Don't indicate their encoding, which raises a message in the Firefox console:
" The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol. "
Cordially.
