Expected Behavior
I was wondering if there is still an access to Flask snippets? I tried to follow http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/70/ but the documentation has evolved since this link has been written, I get the documentation main page (https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).
Actual Behavior
Actually, the same behavior is observable in the official documentation. The Flask snippet archive URL in documentation (http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/) is somehow obsolete or missing, as it redirects to doc main page:
There are more user contributed snippets and patterns in the `Flask
Snippet Archives <http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/>`_.
Environment
Flask version: 1.1
