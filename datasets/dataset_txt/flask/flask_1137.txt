@auth.route('/users/<int:user_id>')
If user_id > sys.maxint then user_id is long.
Is this actually wanted behavior? Because now you cant actually pass those forward without double checking them. Found this when I was expecting integer to be integer and passed it to straigh to peewee and got "OverflowError: long too big to convert".
