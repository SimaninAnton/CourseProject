When writing local-only apps we want to open the web browser after the flask app starts up.
Currently we do:
threading.Timer(1.25, lambda: webbrowser.open(url) ).start()
app.run(port=port)
However it would be nice not to have a guessed time like 1.25, also it would be nice for the opening of the browser to be cancelled incase starting the flask app fails.
Possibly would look like:
app.run(port=port, onstart=lambda: webbrowser.open(url))
