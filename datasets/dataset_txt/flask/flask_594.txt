Setting the FLASK_APP and FLASK_DEBUG for every new terminal session is inconvenient. The CLI could load a .env file that contained these values instead. Since Heroku is a popular deployment option, this would also help developers who want the same scheme locally.
Instead of writing our own parser, we should use python-dotenv. This reduces maintenance burden on us and can be an optional dependency. If it is installed, the CLI will load the .env, otherwise it will skip it.
Previously discussed in #2164.
@miguelgrinberg raised a good point in the previous thread. .env is typically used to store sensitive configuration. The convenience of setting FLASK_APP= there could encourage users to commit the file publicly, which would be bad.
A solution would be to load two files, .flask-env and .env, and prominently document that .flask-env can be committed but should not contain secrets.
