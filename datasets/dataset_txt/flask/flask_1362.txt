In version 0.9 I could simply get the value of the session like this:
flask.session.serialize()
But after upgrading to 0.10 this is not working anymore.. what's the alternative? How can I get the session value?
(flask.request.cookies.get('session') is not good for me, because I would like to get the session right after login, so it's not part of the request yet)
