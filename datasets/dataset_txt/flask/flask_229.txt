I have a Flask app on Google App Engine and my static files are in a Google bucket.
I'm using static_host like so:
def create_app(config_name):
    app = Flask(__name__, host_matching=True, static_host='storage.googleapis.com/mybucket')
And I'm also using Flask-SSLify for the basic redirect from http to https:
app = create_app(os.getenv('FLASK_CONFIG') or 'default')
sslify = SSLify(app, permanent=True)
But when I launch on App Engine my static files won't load because they are being requested with http. In other words, my app is successfully on https but the static file URLs are being built like http://storage.googleapis.com/mybucket/... without https.
It seems SSLify is just building a before_request to do redirects, so I'm not sure where to tell Flask to request my static host with https.
