By default if your application runs in production mode, Flask will display a very simple page for you and log the exception to the logger.
But https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/logging.py#L34
    class DebugHandler(StreamHandler):
        def emit(x, record):
            StreamHandler.emit(x, record) if app.debug else None
This means Flask just ignore all errors and not produce any logs.
We can't get exception message and traceback in production envirionment.
