Hello,
I'm using python (default version 2.7.3) on Ubuntu, I installed flask
and then I'm running the tests of Flaskr and I got 3 errors.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "flaskr_tests.py", line 12, in <module>
    import flaskr
  File "/home/user/flaskr/flaskr.py", line 14, in <module>
    from flask import Flask, request, session, g, redirect, url_for, abort, \
ImportError: cannot import name _app_ctx_stack
I don't really understand how Flask doesn't have an object that Flaskr request, how could I fix it ?
Thanks in advance.
