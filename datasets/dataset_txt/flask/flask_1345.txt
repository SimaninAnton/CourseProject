Hey, this is the simplest flask ever
@app.route("/")
def landing():
return render_template('index.html')
@app.route("/path:all_other_urls")
def missing_url(all_other_urls):
'''
Redirect and be done with it
'''
return redirect('/')
Yes its just set up to redirect everything to index.html.
Some random times flask doesnt render index.html but Hello World, out of the blue, and if i append a slash(or remove it) to the url it serves index.html again.
Any ideas?
