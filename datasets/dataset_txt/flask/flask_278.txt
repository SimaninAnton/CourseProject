Hi!
Why function send_file don't support Range header in request?
I send request with next header: Range: bytes=0-10.
this is part of my code:
return send_file(file, attachment_filename=filename, conditional=True)
But flask application return status code 200 instead 206.
Expected Behavior
status code = 206
Actual Behavior
status code = 200
Environment
Python version: 3.5.3
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version:
