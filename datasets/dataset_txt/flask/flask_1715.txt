Hello,
it seems that request.data only has content if the mime type is unknown
I think it would be handy to be able to access the raw POST data even if the mime type is know:
for example i m POSTing a JSON string, but i don t want flask to unserialize it because i'll do it later.
The same with curl -d that add a mime type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded so, request.data is empty
