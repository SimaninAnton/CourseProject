Rationale
Some Views could be created and used only once, for example MethodViews instead of "standard" functions with if request.method == 'POST'. This kind of use could be made easier.
Proposal
Instead of writing:
class MyFantasticView(View):
    ...
app.add_url_rule('/fantastic/', view_func=MyFantasticView.as_view('fantastic'))
we could make it easier and consistent with other parts of the API:
@app.route('/fantastic/', endpoint='fantastic')
class MyFantasticView(View):
    ...
