The downside is that you cannot unregister a blueprint once an application was created without having to destroy the whole application object.
this statement appears in the docs, but is there a design reason behind this, or is it just because it hasn't been implemented yet? if it's not possible, what are alternatives for disabling an endpoint other than using some kind of variable to store whether an endpoint should be active?
