I am using flask to run my long process that already related to session which hold user id and other information. i try to use new thread with both following methods but still got error 'RuntimeError: Working outside of request context.'
Method 1
import threading
Thread(target=lambda: fn(**args)).start()
Method 2
import thread
thread.start_new_thread(fn, (), args)
