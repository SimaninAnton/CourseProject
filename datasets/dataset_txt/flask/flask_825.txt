For the latest CLI feature (Thanks a lot for that BTW), to run a app, we currently do:
$ export FLASK_APP=/path/to/hello.py
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1
$ flask run
Wouldn't it be nice, if app and debug variables could also be passed as arguments, That way, we can also do
$ flask --app=/path/to/hello.py --debug run
I as a user would prefer the first option in a production environment, but for development, the second option (CLI arguments) would be much comfortable.
What do you guys think about this ?
