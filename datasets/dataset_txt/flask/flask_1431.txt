I might implement it if you find the idea interesting: what do you think of raising JSONBadRequest when trying to access an item that does not exist in the JSON data?
Just like request.form["absent"] will raise BadRequest, it seems logical that request.json["absent"] raises JSONBadRequest.
It is yet unclear to me whether flask or werkzeug is responsible for it. The BadRequest behavior is defined in werkzeug but JSONBadRequest is defined in flask. Also, flask already raise JSONBadRequest when accessing request.json and the JSON parsing failed.
Thanks a lot,
Charles
