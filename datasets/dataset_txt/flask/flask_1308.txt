HI, I was testing flaskr because I want to use it (for my website).
When you write javascript code into the text form a XSS appear:
So, we have to fix it editing show_entries.html:
" { entry.title }} {{ entry.text| safe }} "
replacing it for :
" {{ entry.title }} {{ entry.text }} "
Now, if I wirte the js code again, the xss will disappear:
<svg/onload=confirm(document.cookie);>
EDIT : I guess that it's an intentional vulnerability but is not the correct way to do it, we(my team and I) will continue writing it to improve the "example code"
Regards
