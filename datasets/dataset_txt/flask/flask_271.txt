Expected Behavior
This snippet should open a serial port and start flask in debug mode.
from flask import Flask
import serial 

ser = serial.Serial('\\\\.\\COM3',9600)
app = Flask(__name__)

app.run(debug=True)
Actual Behavior
An exception is thrown saying that the serial port is in use.
This only happens if debug=True is present.
It works as expected if I only have app.run()
Environment
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2'
