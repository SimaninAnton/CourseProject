[Revised after reading the code more carefully.]
I'd like to use Flask sessions with a few tweaks:
json instead of pickle
sha256 or sha512 instead of sha1
expiration when the browser closes or after an idle time limit, whichever comes first: save_cookie(session_expires=something, expires=None)
automatically updated last-request time, to support the idle time limit
In the absence of direct support of these features, I think I can accomplish them with a SecureCookie/Session subclass. It looks like I can make Flask use my subclass by overriding Flask.open_session(), but since the existing method contains slightly more logic than simply instantiating a Session, I'm concerned that overriding it might introduce strange behavior with future versions of Flask
Would you consider exposing an official means of using a custom Session/SecureCookie class? Maybe even turning some of the above tweaks into Flask configuration options?
