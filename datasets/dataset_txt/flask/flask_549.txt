The link http://flask.pocoo.org/login/?provider=google will not redirect to anywhere for me to input the OpenID from my google account.
If I paste the OpenID from google into the http://flask.pocoo.org/login page, the following error message is always shown.
Error: The OpenID was invalid
Is this a bug? How to login with google?
