Factors is a very useful function, which is used to generate flask with different configuration files in different environments
Look at the example, it is well integrated with flask SQL alchemy
Flask Sqlalchemy only needs db.init app (APP)
Sqlalchemy needs more information to set up
engine = create_engine('sqlite:////tmp/test.db', convert_unicode=True)
db_session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(autocommit=False,autoflush=False,bind=engine))
Base = declarative_base()
Base.query = db_session.query_property()
How to combine the two effectively?
I'm sorry for my poor English.
