I had a friend that was going through the quickstart, and he had absolutely no idea that there were any extensions available for flask.
He was using SQLAlchemy directly and was becoming quite frustrated quickly.
Since an ecosystem is clearly part of a framework, I think we should add some hints about extensions throughout the documentation. Not necessarily usage examples, just "hey, this extension might be useful to you".
