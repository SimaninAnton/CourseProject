If I have multilanguage site, for example english version hosted on example.com and russian on example.ru I can't create url to site with another language with url_for.
If I have static files and want put it to CDN for production. I can't set url to it with url_for.
So it will be greate add additional variable to _external, _method, _achor like _server_name (or make _external as string to another host) for url_for.
If _server_name is None (or _external is False or not basestring) , then return url like now.
If _server_name is not None and _external is True, then raise exception or ignore _external.
If _servet_name is not None and _external is False (or _external is basestring), then return url like application config have SERVER_NAME == _sever_name and _external is True.
Also will be greate make default _server_name (or _external) for specific endpoints. For example for static endpoint add default server name to application config because it allow move current static to CDN with changing just config.
