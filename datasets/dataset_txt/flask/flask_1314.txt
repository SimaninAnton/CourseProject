I like to have the local documentation of Flask in a Firefox pinned tab along some others. To distinguish it from the others I include a <link rel> to the index.html:
<link rel="icon" href="_static/flask.png" type="image/png" />
I tried to find where in the sources to make the change but I have no time now to learn sphinx.
Would it be possible to include it in the next release?
