For installing Flask under a virtual environment with python3, the procedure is somewhat different that what is proposed in the Documentation, under Installation, virtuallenv. See Answer by geckon to question Using Python 3 in virtualenv
This is a minor change, just
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
instead of
virtualenv venv
I would be willing to contribute with this if assigned the task.
