Dear Flask-Team,
thanks for the good work. I have been using Flask for quite a while now.
In my project I use flask to receive requests from a command line client.
The server is running with an adhoc SSL context. The client sends a SSL client certificate which I need to parse in the request handler.
If I use a web server (e.g. nginx) to dispatch the request to Flask, I can configure the request environment to include the client certificate like so:
fastcgi_param CLIENT_CERT $ssl_client_cert;
fastcgi_param CLIENT_RAW_CERT $ssl_client_raw_cert;
Now, I want the same behavior when I run the development server (or any other mean to get the client cert).
Currently I am starting the app server like so:
self._app.run(host=host, port=app_port, ssl_context='adhoc', debug=True)
Can you help?
