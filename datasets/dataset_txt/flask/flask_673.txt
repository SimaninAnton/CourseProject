Hello,
I am deploying a flask app using Apache Web Server in an EC2 instance. My problem is that I can only make a few successful requests per minute, then the service would have a Connection Timed Out error after. I would have to wait for a couple of minutes to make successful requests again.
The application is an SMTP service.
Any thoughts/help is greatly appreciated.
