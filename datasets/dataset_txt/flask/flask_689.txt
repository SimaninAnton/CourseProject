I'm trying to start the extremely basic flask application noted here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/
When I try to run "flask run" however I get the following error
 * Serving Flask-SocketIO app "hello"
Traceback (most recent call last):

I've tried installing Flask via pip as well as from source, and verified that all the dependencies are installed. If I use the app.run() command in main it works fine, but I'd like to use flask run after exporting the program name but it doesn't seem to work. I've followed the instructions exactly from the website. Any advice?
