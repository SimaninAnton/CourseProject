I have a large response in the order of 2MB. I generate it in my Python code and send it back using jsonify(resp) and the server cut short the response and delivered partial response. - Issue 1
to overcome this issue I streamed the response into a file and exposed a GET api using send_from_directory(absolute_file_path, filename) - it sends back the file but has compressed some items like byte streams inside!
Please find attached an example of this file.
