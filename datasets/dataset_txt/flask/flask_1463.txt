In flask/helpers.py, near the top of url_for() there is this code:
    appctx = _app_ctx_stack.top
    reqctx = _request_ctx_stack.top
    if appctx is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Attempted to generate a URL with the application '
                           'context being pushed.  This has to be executed ')
It looks like that RuntimeError message is cut off. This has to be executed when? :)
