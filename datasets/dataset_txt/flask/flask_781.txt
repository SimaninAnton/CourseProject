Just noticed Logbook 1.0 was released a month ago, and was reminded of discussion about it on the mailing list (e.g. http://librelist.com/browser/flask/2011/12/28/flask-+-logbook/). Armin mentioned his desire to add Logbook integration to Flask in that 5-year-old thread, but I didn't see any mention of it here in the tracker, so I figured I'd open a ticket. If that's no longer the intention please close, but either way looking forward to finding out the latest plans.
