We're using flask to serve mostly REST endpoints, and doing some setup at startup to create all the URL rules. Effectively, we're calling app.add_url_rule() for each method for each endpoint. This means that flask autogenerates an OPTIONS method and function for each ( https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/app.py#L1019 ), with no way to override.
Can provide_automatic_options be added as a kwarg to add_url_rule, in case nothing is specified on the view_func?
