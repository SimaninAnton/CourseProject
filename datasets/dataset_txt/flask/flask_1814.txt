add_url_rule should accept an optional view function. Currently you need to do two steps to associate a rule, endpoint and view_function.
This issue is suggesting that it should only take one step. Replace add_url_rule(self, rule, endpoint, *_options) with add_url_rule(self, rule, endpoint, view_func=None, *_options)
