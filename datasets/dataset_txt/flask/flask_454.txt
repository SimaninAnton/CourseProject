The tutorial currently describes why escaping in Jinja is good, then proceeds to do {{ entry.text|safe }}. There's an explanation for this in the introduction, "This HTML is not sanitized because we trust the user here." but that's not reiterated near the safe call, and isn't really a good pattern to teach in a tutorial anyway.
Many users end up copying the nl2br filter from the Jinja docs or Flask snippet. I think it's a common and reasonable use case between "trust user input" and "use markdown". It would allow nicely formatted posts in the tutorial without sacrificing security.
