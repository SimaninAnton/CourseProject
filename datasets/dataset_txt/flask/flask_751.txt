Flask started to ship with a default, hardcoded logging handler. Unfortunately this setup makes it harder to install custom logging setups, because then you'll have to undo all the things Flask did to the app logger, or replace the app.logger entirely. A symptom of this is #1993, where Flask's own logger had to be tweaked yet again such that messages didn't get logged twice (once via Flask's setup, once via the custom one).
My question is: Do we even want Flask to do any logging setup? It appears that this sort of default logging is only useful during development, so maybe it makes sense to set up a default logging handler in the new Flask CLI instead of from within the application.
