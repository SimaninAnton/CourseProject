I've just upgraded to the newest Flask version - 0.9.
I have to use Flask with CGI and I use .htaccess rule to rewrite the urls:
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9-/?]*)$ main.py/$1 [L]
In version 0.8 I didn't have any problems but now url_for() doesn't rewrite the rule and urls come with 'main.py' - http://localhost/zaemide/main.py/funding
