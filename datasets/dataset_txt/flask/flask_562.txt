Using TCP/5000 as the default port for flask may be a bad choice. I just had to debug a problem where I wasn't able to reach my service from outside of my network because the firewall (and I assume many firewalls do this) blocks incoming requests on port 5000.
This port is used for universal plug-and-play (UPNP) and it's considered a security problem if it's reachable from the internet says source1 and source2.
I therefore suggest to change the default port or mention this possible problem in the documentation so others don't have to search for this problem as long as I did.
