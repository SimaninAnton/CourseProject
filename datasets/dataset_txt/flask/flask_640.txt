I got a circular import error in my flask app,
and i launch it using flask run.
it seems to launch but when i go the endpoint with my browser,
i got a pretty misleading error message :
NoAppException: The file/path provided (run) does not appear to exist. Please verify the path is correct. If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py
but when i run it using the run.py file i got:
ImportError: cannot import name XXXX
it can be great to have a better exception when there is an import error
