When I send an item to my server I get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\werkzeug\serving.py", line 648, in inner
    fd = int(os.environ['WERKZEUG_SERVER_FD'])
   File "C:\Python27\lib\os.py", line 425, in __getitem__
    return self.data[key.upper()]
 KeyError: 'WERKZEUG_SERVER_FD'

Can't seem to figure out why. I am sending the item to the server as a base64. I should note that I am sending an image as a base64
