Expected Behavior
view_args are unescaped and passed to view functions as the original strings
@app.route("/testurl/<string:test_arg>)
def test_func(test_arg):
    print(f"test arg is: {test_arg}")
    # args with spaces produce "arg%20with%20spaces"


#------------------------
import requests
requests.get("testurl/arg with spaces")
Actual Behavior
The view args are passed in url percent escape format
Other Info
I recently changed servers. It was working fine previously. Maybe an encoding issue?
