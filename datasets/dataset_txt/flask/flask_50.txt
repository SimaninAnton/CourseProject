I need to scale the flask based micro-service to handle 1K-requests/sec, but the call are sync calls to 3rd party which would block 8 to 10 secs. Celery or RQ is not an option (due to certain restrictions).
Is there a specific example of how to approach using the gunicorn + gevent + workers + flask
