I have this weird problem. I am trying to include css files from the static directory, the browser downloads the content of the CSS file but it says the server is sending the css with mime-type:text/plain
It's best explained here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23452967/jinja2-static-files-mime-type-always-text-plain. I am unable to include any CSS file.
