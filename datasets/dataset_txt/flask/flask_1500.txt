Try this simple routing function:
@app.route(u'/♥/')
def heart():
return "It works"
Or
@app.route('/%E2%99%A5/')
def heart():
return "It works"
Trying to GET /%E2%99%A5/ HTTP/1.1
(which is what a browser does when trying to reach http://example.com/♥/)
You get a 404 not found in return.
I could not found anything in the doc talking about that, so I assume it’s a bug.
