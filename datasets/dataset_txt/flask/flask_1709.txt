Maybe use of one of these should be suggested:
setup.py egg_info ...
--tag-svn-revision (-r)  Add subversion revision ID to version number
--tag-date (-d)          Add date stamp (e.g. 20050528) to version number
--tag-build (-b)         Specify explicit tag to add to version number
A problem with this is that setup.py --fullname does not include the tag. Not really an issue with -b, a useful value might be git log -1 --format=%h for example.
Another thought: why go through all that trouble to extract the tarball?
easy_install myapp.tar.gz
Also: why not call pack() in deploy?
