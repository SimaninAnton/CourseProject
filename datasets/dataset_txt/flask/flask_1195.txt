I followed the documentation found on flask's site. What I was looking to do was pip install Flask==dev. Received the following traceback:
(burddy)crow@ burddy (master)$ pip install Flask==dev
Downloading/unpacking Flask==dev
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Flask==dev (from versions: 0.1, 0.10.1, 0.10, 0.2, 0.3.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5.1, 0.5.2, 0.5, 0.6.1, 0.6, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7, 0.8.1, 0.8, 0.9)
Cleaning up...
