flask run outputs some extra information when starting. Extract this and print it when calling app.run too.
app.run runs after the app is loaded and the config created. It can call load_dotenv, which could change the ENV or DEBUG env vars, but the config won't be updated. If using dotenv, reconfigure env and debug if the env vars are set.
flask run enables threading by default, app.run does not.
Working on this, just creating the issue for tracking.
