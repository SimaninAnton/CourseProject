This is my own fault as I was looking for other more non-obvious issues with my permissions but the documentation here:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/
Uses httpd 2.2 syntax for directory permissions.
At the very least, a note should be added to remind folks to use httpd 2.4 syntax of "Require All Granted".
