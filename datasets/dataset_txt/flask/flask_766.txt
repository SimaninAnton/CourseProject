If you’re using the interactive debugger in the web browser, and autocorrect is feeling aggressive, it can kick in and try to “fix” the Python commands you’re typing. This is annoying for the end-user, and rarely helpful as autocorrect doesn’t know about Python. More than once this has bitten me, causing me to write invalid Python, or for variable names to change case mid-command.
I don’t have time to create a patch now, but I think the fix is just adding the following attribute to the <input> tag where you type commands:
autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false"
This probably isn’t really Flask’s fault – the OS is what actually makes the unhelpful autocorrections – but it seems like something Flask should be able to fix.
I spotted this on the developer builds of OS X Sierra, where autocorrect seems noticeably keener (especially in <input> fields) than older versions.
