Expected Behavior
The Flask docs should link to the correct page for the Flask Extension registry, or, if this no longer exists, references to it should be removed from the docs.
Actual Behavior
The page about extensions at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/extensions/ has a link to http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/ which redirects to https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/ This latter page does not contain any info about Flask extensions, nor does it indicate where that might be found.
Environment
Flask version: docs to Flask 1.1. Also current docs on master.
