Hi,
The documentation could be improved a bit. Chapter 10 "Configuration Handling" explains well ho to set the config. However, it doesn't explain how to retrieve values from the config in other files. I found the following solution:
from flask import current_app as app
...
app.config['MY_SETTINGS']
It should be added to the docs.
Best,
Laszlo
