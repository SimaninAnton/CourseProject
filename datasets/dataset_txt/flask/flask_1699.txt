When using the flash() function I use get_flashed_messages() in the template for display. Today when attempting to use the variable "messages" in my template I found the flashed messages are exposed there as a global in the templates. That's probably ok but unless I missed it, this is not documented in the flash() documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#message-flashing or the jinja context here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/templating/
My "messages" were hidden completely by the (empty) flash messages until I realized what might be happening.
Anyhow, thanks for the great tools!
