Happened twice,The requester can receive my return data, but there is nothing printed on my side.
@app.route('/appdata', methods=['POST'])
def appdata():
logging.info(request)
import json
logging.info(request.values.to_dict())
a = request.values.to_dict()['msg']
dict1 = json.loads(a)
from datetime import datetime
dict1['resivetime'] = datetime.now()
logging.info(dict1)
queues.put(dict1)
return '200'
The requester will have this data, the recipient, as above, did not print any logs, and appeared almost once a week or so.And There is no error message here.
