I place my virtualenvs in a .env directory in my project directory. Flask 1.x sees this directory and thinks it might be a "dotenv" file (even though it is a directory).
Expected Behavior
flask should ignore a .env directory when python-dotenv is not installed.
Actual Behavior
flask says:
Tip: There are .env files present. Do "pip install python-dotenv" to use them.
Environment
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
