Hi, Im only posting my issue here as a last resort, I understand this is a bug tracker. But I think its fair to say that flask default session lasting 31 days is a bug and security flaw in itself, and havent found an easy way to change this. Im simply trying to set a timeout of 15 minutes idle activity for my user sessions (site-wide but particularly for my @login_required '/dashboard/' area) I tried eliminating different variables to solve the problem but still the session lasts indefinitely. Heres the post of my imports, config, dashboard, blueprint, register / login system in its entirety (dont worry its rather succinct). Hopefully someone can see an error I overlooked. Thank you.
