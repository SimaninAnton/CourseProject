So here is my pain â€” there are no structure restrictions. Single file is fine until there are more than X lines. And apps do grow. Very fast. No restrictions are good, but structure skeletons are awesome. Let me explain it...
I had big problems w/ re-structuring my app so that everything is not in a single file. I'm just a newbie programmer, not an architect. At least for now. Micro frameworks should improve my productivity, not forcing me to structure things.
I suggest to create skeletons / boilerplate for possible ways to structure app. They could be sorted for estimated size of the product (tiny, small, medium, big & huge) plus used components (ORM, template engine, test framework, form abstraction etc.). What do you think?
