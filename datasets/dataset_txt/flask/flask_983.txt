Hello,
I'm running into the problem described in stackoverflow here.
The code is running on the server normally and on my colleagues computers. Though on my computer for every route is returning a 404 error, though static content is working. The capture below shows that I'm working on the good port and the route exists.
I reinstalled the virtuelenv and I still have this issues. Do you guys have ever encountered this problem?
I'm using Python 2.7.6 and flask:
Flask==0.10.1
Werkzeug==0.10.4
Jinja2==2.7.3
Any answer is welcome.
Cheers,
Alexis.
