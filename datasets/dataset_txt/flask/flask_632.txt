FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app('dev')

Gunicorn does this with eval, which I'm not super happy with. Instead, we could use literal_eval to allow a simple list of arguments. The line should never be so complicated that eval would be necessary anyway.
# might need to fix this regex
m = re.search(r'(\w+)(\(.*\))', app_obj)

if m:
    app = getattr(mod, m.group(1))(*literal_eval(m.group(2)))
