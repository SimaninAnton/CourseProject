It looks like flask.json does not allow the user to specify an alternative json library (such as rapidjson). Instead it just does this:
try:
    from itsdangerous import simplejson as _json
except ImportError:
    from itsdangerous import json as _json
This currently un-overridable behavior also means that, due to differences in when default(..) is called between simplejson and json, bugs can mysteriously appear when simplejson is installed that didn't appear without it.
Would you consider giving the user some control over which json library is used?
