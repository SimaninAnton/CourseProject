This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
Expected Behavior
Template should be renderd
taSession=Transaktionshandler(path,username,sha1pw[0][0])
...some basic session stuff....
return render_template(index.html)
Actual Behavior
I am importing a Module that wraps my c++ code (python capi). That Modul contains a struct. When I create the struct some connections and threads are initialized. Nothing fails. After this i am doing some Session handling, nothing failes. But at the moment i want to render a template python crashes. When i return instate of render template somthing like return "TEST", python do not crash.
On the other hand, when I don't load my Modul there is no problem.
I am Debugging with msvc and i can see that the render_template function runs, but i cant't jump into the _render function of the templatin.py file.
Environment
Python version: 3.5.4
