Does anyone keep this updated?
Should the concept of "approved" extensions get dropped?
Similarly, with the transition to pallets, what's going to happen to the extensions list itself? http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/
Will it get dropped like snippets are?
See also #865 about updating the docs on approved extensions.
