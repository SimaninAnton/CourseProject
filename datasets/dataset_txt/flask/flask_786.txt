When app.config["SERVER_NAME"] contains an explicit port of 80 (i.e. domain.tld:80) the flask test client fails to process get urls at subdomains. There are three test cases:
Explicit port 80 in SERVER_NAME: All subdomain requests redirect to 404 in test client.
Implicit port 80 in SERVER_NAME: Subdomain requests work.
Explicit port that is not 80: Subdomain requests work if the port is provided correctly.
