When app.config['DEBUG] = True, request.input_stream object has __enter__ and __exit__ methods which is cool because we can use it with with clause.
When not in debug mode though, using input_stream object with with clause causes an AttributeError: __exit__ to be thrown.
I am using request.input_stream object in a flask-restplus end-point to retrieve a file whose size is larger than RAM. I also realized that this stream object will not be there if the file size is small.
