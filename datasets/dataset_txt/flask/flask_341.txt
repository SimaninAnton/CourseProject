Expected Behavior
Running flask --version should output Flask, Python and Werkzeug versions, as those are the versions asked in the issue template on github.
Actual Behavior
flask --version only outputs Flask and Python versions (and GCC, for some reason?).
Environment
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
