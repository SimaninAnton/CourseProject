Hello, i'm using this repository to start learning python + flask.
I red that flask with the help of jinja2 should escape any sql injection or xss attack.
Anyway if i start using the flaskr app in the examples i see that it is possible to inject xss code, i did a simple test with [<script>alert"hello"</script> ohh...github doesn't show the code of the alert] and it's working...it's a permanent xxs because it is written in the db. I would like to start writing secure code from the beginning, someone could explain how to avoid xss in this simple app? many thanks
