Apologies if this was fixed, but I can't find a solution online.
I'm following the tutorial in a virtualenv and when I try to run the flaskr.py file, I get:
ImportError: No module named inspect
I've seen references to this being a corrupted sys.path in virtualenv but not everyone seems to have this problem. I'm using Python 2.7.2 on OSX with the virtualenv setup described on the flask website.
