I have some code that basically does:
self.data = session['cart']
and then later:
self.data['some-key'] = 'some-value'
This always used to update the session, but now it doesn't. If I change my code to be as follows:
self.data['some-key'] = 'some-value'
session.modified = True
It suddenly works again.
