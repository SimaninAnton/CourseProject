it appears that request.mimetype is always an empty string - which I assume is a bug:
$ cat testcase.py
from flask import Flask, request, make_response


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def root():
    response = make_response("mimetype: %s\n\n%s" % (repr(request.mimetype),
            request.headers))
    response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/plain"
    return response


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

$ python testcase.py &

$ curl -X GET -H "Accept: text/plain" http://127.0.0.1:5000/
mimetype: ''

Accept: text/plain
...

$ curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:5000/
mimetype: ''

Accept: application/json
...

$ curl -X GET -H \
    "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" \
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
mimetype: ''

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
...
My expectation was that request.mimetype be populated based on the Accept header - is this perhaps misguided?
(I've traced this into Werkzeug, but kinda got lost along the way.)
