My Python Flask application contains a lot of route definitions like
@app.route('/')
def index():
Then pylint complains
W: 72, 4: Unused variable 'index' (unused-variable)
which is technically correct. I can't replace all the function names by _, say, because then Flask complains
AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: _
I could replace all the handler function names with their underscore-prefixed equivalents, i.e. change index to _index, etc.. Is there another idiomatic way of dealing with this problem?
(I also asked this question on StackOverflow but got no responses.)
