On December 7, 2015 Ryan Reid published a blog post called "Injecting Flask" .
In his post he demonstrated several attacks against a naive Flask / Jinja2 based implementation of a website.
I'm not sure if Flask has documented best practices which would mitigate the problem and I couldn't find any hint of a discussion of his blog post in the Flask community.
Are there plans to fix or document the problem?
For me it's a rather minor thing because I only have one internal service which depends on Flask, but I'm sure other developers may have many more and this is a serious security issue.
