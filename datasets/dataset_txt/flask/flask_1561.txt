The Blueprints example on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/blueprints is broken because it doesn't include the templates_folder param, which evidently is required now because templates_folder defaults to None (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/blueprints.py).
See http://librelist.com/browser//flask/2011/9/17/templates-for-blueprints/#34dea3bacebdd468a670709228abb067
