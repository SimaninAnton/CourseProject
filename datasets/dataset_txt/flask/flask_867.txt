Since Zappa now integrates seamlessly with Flask, I was wondering if you'd be open to the notion of having Zappa as one of the documented deployment options. I'm willing to write the docs myself, but I wanted to confirm the feature before submitting a pull request. I've also already written a small tutorial if anybody is interested in learning more.
Thanks!
