I see that version 1.0 includes a lot of significant changes. It may be reasonable to change the default value of option TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD to False. It will reduce mostly useless interaction with the hard drive and positive impact on performance.
I think most apps that use Flask will never change the template files on the fly in production, so this change is not reflected in their stability. For other cases, it remains possible to explicitly set the value to True. And of course, it will not affect the debugging capabilities.
More explanation in related PR: #876. It's merged, but default value is set to True for backward compatibility.
@untitaker, @kennethreitz what do you think about this?
