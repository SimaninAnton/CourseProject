Flask gets more and more docstrings and inline documentation comments so that it becomes a quite large file. I would love to split this up for the next release into the following modules:
flask - imports the public api
flask.ctx - _RequestContext and all kinds of locals
flask.app - Config/App
flask.module - Module
flask.helpers - the helper functions such as url_for, jsonify etc.
flask.wrappers - Request/Response/_RequestContext
flask.session - Session
