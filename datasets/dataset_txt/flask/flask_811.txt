I'm trying to run the "flaskr" and "minitwit" examples, but I'm running into an import error issue. I'm trying to follow the instructions from the README file. When running flask initdb, I get the following error:

ImportError: No module named 'flaskr'
I'm using an Anaconda Python install on both Windows 10 (Python 3.5) and Linux (Python 3.4) with either the stock flask 0.11 install or an install from the latest git repo. I'm running this code from appropriate directory and am able to import flaskr or minitwit from a terminal Python session. I can run the other examples that do not require the flask script.
