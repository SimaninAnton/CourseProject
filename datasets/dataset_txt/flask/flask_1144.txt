Calling flask.redirect() or returning data from a callback passed to Blueprint#before_app_request() are ignored, despite the callback executing.
Flask#before_request() and Blueprint#before_request() both appear to work as intended, redirecting and/or handling the request as appropriate.
It's not immediately clear from reading the inline documentation that this particular behavior is intended. The only documentation I can find on the matter is on Flask#preprocess_request(), which doesn't really touch on Blueprint behavior:
    """Called before the actual request dispatching and will
    call every as :meth:`before_request` decorated function.
    If any of these function returns a value it's handled as
    if it was the return value from the view and further
    request handling is stopped.

    This also triggers the :meth:`url_value_processor` functions before
    the actual :meth:`before_request` functions are called.
    """
Is this a bug or just an undocumented / intended behavior?
