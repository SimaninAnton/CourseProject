Expected Behavior
Previously in our development environment we ran flask app from vscode but after we updated to the latest version of flask we started experiencing problems. After some investigation I found out that in our run configuration we specify the whole path to the app.py-file. Changing to just referencing it directly (i.e. app.py instead of C:\Path\To\My\app.py) I got it to work.
I recreated the fault in another simpler environment:
The following command runs
env "FLASK_APP=`pwd`/app.py" "FLASK_ENV=Development" "FLASK_DEBUG=1" env/Scripts/python.exe -m flask run
but when you try to access localhost:5000/ you get the following error
  File "C:\Users\AlexanderS\code\flask-bugg\env\lib\site-packages\flask\cli.py", line 330, in __call__
    rv = self._load_unlocked()
  File "C:\Users\AlexanderS\code\flask-bugg\env\lib\site-packages\flask\cli.py", line 317, in _load_unlocked
    self._app = rv = self.loader()
  File "C:\Users\AlexanderS\code\flask-bugg\env\lib\site-packages\flask\cli.py", line 372, in load_app
    app = locate_app(self, import_name, name)
  File "C:\Users\AlexanderS\code\flask-bugg\env\lib\site-packages\flask\cli.py", line 246, in locate_app
    'Could not import "{name}".'.format(name=module_name)
flask.cli.NoAppException: Could not import "C".
Actual Behavior
The application should run without errors.
Environment
Python version: 3.6.5
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
Recreated the bug with the follow app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello world2'
