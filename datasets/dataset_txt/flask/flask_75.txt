I want to get file list from form by using:
photos = request.files.getlist("photo")
However if i haven't select anything, the photos value is never be [] like other fields.
So the way to check for empty field is failed:
if not photos:
   pass
The result for empty form is:
[<FileStorage: '' ('application/octet-stream')>]
How do i get rid of it?
