I use the flask extension flask-theme, it has a import ï¼š
from flask import (Module, send_from_directory, render_template, json,
_request_ctx_stack, abort, url_for)
the master version has no Module
so I reinstall flask to 0.10.1, but it hasn't cli.py
so , I want to know, the module.py is not necessary in the fulture?
