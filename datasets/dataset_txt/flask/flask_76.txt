Expected Behavior
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=443 --cert=host.crt --key=host.key
It works after run command above
After deploy to apache using mod_wsgi,
It also works fine for basic request, but it does't work if you pass Authorization key as Headers, It seems the value can't be passed successfully
# Paste a minimal example that causes the problem.
Actual Behavior
Paste the full traceback if there was an exception.
Environment
Python version: python3.6
Flask version: flask1.0
Werkzeug version:Werkzeug0.15.5
