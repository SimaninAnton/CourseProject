Expected Behavior
All tutorial steps should work
Actual Behavior
error in method not imported
return "User  %s" % escape(username)
NameError: name 'escape' is not defined
I think all the steps of the tutorial should be followed without errors, this helps the beginners. At Quickstart, Variable Rules generate an error because the escape method was not imported earlier in the tutorial. I could open a PR for that, but repeating the previous code doesn't make much sense to me, and I can't think of a way to not make it messy. So I'll open this issue before I sleep and forget it.
It may seem like a silly issue, but I always worry about documentation and how easy it should be for beginners to follow.
