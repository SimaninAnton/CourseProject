Expected Behavior
When I import some_package_that_doesnt_exist I should get ImportError: No module named 'some_package_that_doesnt_exist', but something is swallowing the ImportError and assuming it means I mistyped the filename of my server code.
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

import aoeu
what happens
$ export FLASK_APP='flask_error_demonstration.py'
$ flask run
Usage: flask run [OPTIONS]

Error: The file/path provided (flask_error_demonstration) does not appear to exist.  Please verify the path is correct.  If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py
what should happen
$ export FLASK_APP='flask_error_demonstration.py'
$ flask run
ImportError: No module named 'aoeu'
Python version: 3.5.3
