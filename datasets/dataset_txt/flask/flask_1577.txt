I have an app with two blueprints - admin and default. Both are stored in separate packages - app.modules.admin and app.modules.default. Both have separate templates and static folders. default is registered first (w/o url_prefix), admin is registered second (with url_prefix='admin'). Now, when rendering a template in an admin view function Flask searches for the file first in default/templates and then in admin/templates, so if I have file home/index.html in both blueprints (which is my case) Flask loads the file from first registered blueprint (default in my case), totally ignoring paths. The same goes for templates loaded with extends statement.
