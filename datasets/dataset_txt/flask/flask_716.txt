...discusses a pattern for defining and catching custom exceptions. However, this pattern does not work unless PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS is set, because the exception gets eaten and turned into a 500.
Confusingly it will work in DEBUG=True mode then break in production.
Can the docs be updated? Or am I missing something?
