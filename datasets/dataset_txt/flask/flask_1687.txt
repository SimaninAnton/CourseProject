Currently Flask calls the blueprint for reusable thingies "Module" which is a terrible name because it already has a lot of meaning in Python. Because Modules also need to be pimped we should consider introducing a new concept altogether with a new name and phase out modules.
For all changes that are backwards incompatible we should consider that people hate updating their code so at the very least provide a script like the werkzeug import rewriter.
