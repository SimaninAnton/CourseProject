For the interactive Python shell, the test_request_function should be invokable to bind the context to the end of the session for easier testing. Something like this:
>>> from yourapplication import app
>>> app.test_request_context().bind()
>>> from flask import request
>>> request.path
u'/'
Or something similar.
