Hi
Looks like flask works different than plain python with Unicode. Let me explain
If i assign an unicode string to a parameter, (test="%$Â£") it works fine
When i run this code as part of a flask execution, i have an error. UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)
I can encode this in utf-8, but i would like to understand why the behaviour is different using flask?
Thanks
