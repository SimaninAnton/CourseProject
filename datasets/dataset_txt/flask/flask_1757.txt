It would be nice to see an example application for 0.5 that is based on Flask plus a few Flask extensions that represents a semi-realworld example of how to do applications.
Example proposals:
A Wiki
showcase how config management works
how to unittest more complex apps
maybe even use modules
Flask-Fungiform for the form handling
Flask-SQLAlchemy for database
flask-mail for sending mail notifications
Flask-OpenID for user authentication
Flask-Babel for i18n
jQuery for client side JavaScript
a creoleparser for the wiki Syntax
Thanks to all the extensions that application could still be reasonable small (~1000 lines of code I guess without the templates)
