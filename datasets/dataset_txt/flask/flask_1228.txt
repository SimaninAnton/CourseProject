I've been using Flask with Python 3 from since it was supported. Back then there were definitely some issues with certain libraries that were only compatible on the git repo and not on pypi. But I'm currently running quite a complex website using Python 3 and Flask and haven't had any real problems in like half a year.
I think Python 3 has become mature, especially with Python 3.4, and the general opinion is that new projects should be using Python 3. The current docs quite strongly suggest otherwise.
I would be happy to rewrite them, but before I do I would like to know if you guys agree.
