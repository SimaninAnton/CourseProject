Hello,
I'm currently using flask while running Python3.5 and I just noticed this Unicode error for the first time. When I run my app in the debug mode, I receive this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 28, in <module>
    app.run(debug=True)
  File "/Users/pranav/WebProjects/FitScout/fit_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 772, in run
    run_simple(host, port, self, **options)
  File "/Users/pranav/WebProjects/FitScout/fit_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py", line 633, in run_simple
    application = DebuggedApplication(application, use_evalex)
  File "/Users/pranav/WebProjects/FitScout/fit_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py", line 169, in __init__
    if self.pin is None:
  File "/Users/pranav/WebProjects/FitScout/fit_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py", line 179, in _get_pin
    self._pin, self._pin_cookie = get_pin_and_cookie_name(self.app)
  File "/Users/pranav/WebProjects/FitScout/fit_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py", line 96, in get_pin_and_cookie_name
    h.update('cookiesalt')
TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing
Is there an existing fix or do I need to change something on my end? I don't receive this error when running my app without the debug flag.
Thanks!
