Hi,
I am getting a segmentation fault when running the flask development server on Alpine Linux. Oddly, this issue only appears to occur when I install a recent version of the requests library (>= v2.13.0). In addition, this issue occurs even if my application is not using or importing the requests lib.
Environment:
python:3.6-alpine Docker image
Python 3.6.1
Flask 0.12
Werkzeug 0.12.1
Commands ran:
/app # flask run
 * Serving Flask app "service"
 * Forcing debug mode on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 960-427-520


/app # pip install requests==2.12.5
...
Successfully installed requests-2.12.5
/app # flask run
