A user can specify a JSONEncoder on a Flask application, but it would be useful to be able to specify a JSONEncoder on a blueprint as well, so that requests made to that blueprint would receive responses interpreted by the specified JSON encoder.
This is important, for example, in Flask-Restless, where we would like to transform SQLAlchemy objects into JSON objects at the blueprint level, without modifying the JSON Encoder assigned to the specific Flask application.
