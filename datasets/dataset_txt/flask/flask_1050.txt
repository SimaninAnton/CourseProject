Hey guys, I was thinking that could be a good ideia create a decorator to put in the head of method, to show what kind of content-type that rest service will return.
Something like that:
@return_json
@app.route('/user/email')
def get_user_email():
   return {'email': 'example@email.com'}
So, in the return_json decorator we could change the content-type of response. If someone think that is a good ideia, I can implement and send a pull request.
