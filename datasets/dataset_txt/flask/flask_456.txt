I've just learned that many people are learning "how to structure Flask application" with this post: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-structure-large-flask-applications via lepture/authlib#8 (comment)
This guide however it really a bad example and many people new to Flask are learning from it. I'd like to create a guide on this topic in the official docs. Here is my thoughts:
Use MVC pattern
Use factory pattern
Another simple example on other folder structure
app/
   __init__.py
   templates/
   models/
   controllers/  (or other names)
