i want to keep-alive requests with flask apps, but actually, i send some requests in a tcp stream, it closed http connection,not tcp connection soon. so i want to know flask keep-alive time ,(like nginx keep-alive time can config by myself, only in conf writes like : keep-alive: 300s). is by default?
