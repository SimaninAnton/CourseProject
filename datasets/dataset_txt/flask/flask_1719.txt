Inside the deploy method
# upload the source tarball to the temporary folder on the server
put('sdist/%s.tar.gz' % dist, '/tmp/yourapplication.tar.gz')
should be
# upload the source tarball to the temporary folder on the server
put('dist/%s.tar.gz' % dist, '/tmp/yourapplication.tar.gz')
(there is an s before dist)
