When I do control-c in the Python Console, it either takes a minute, or doesn't do anything.
Also, when I make a change to the file and save it, it takes a while to reload the file as well.
Running Python 3.4, Windows 8.1. Running in the Spyder IDE Python Console.
Edit: This also happens in the regular python console.
Edit 2: It seems that Control-C takes effect when the file reloads...
