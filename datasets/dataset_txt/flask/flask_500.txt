I noticed the following error while compiling something and it was irksome. Maybe it is worth looking at idk.
The issue is the following.
Say I have the entrypoint to my app be main.py and I export it with export FLASK_APP=main.py. If I then later go back and rename the entrypoint run.py and export it, then sometimes flask will continue to use the main.pyc file which will break the application. It may be that this sometimes also occurs with other .pyc files in general, I am not sure - it irks me that previous .pyc files are not destroyed between FLASK_APP runs if shadowing is a possibility.
Just thought I would point this out - it took me some debugging time and maybe it will save someone else a bit of time.
Thanks.
