Expected Behavior
When using flask run I expect it to use the variables I set in my code.
from flask import Flask

class DevelopmentConfig(object):
    ENV = 'development'
    DEBUG = True

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(DevelopmentConfig)

# then using `flask run`
Actual Behavior
It uses the default 'production' enviroment with debug off.
Environment: production
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Use a production WSGI server instead.
Debug mode: off
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Environment
Python version: 3.7.3
Flask version: 1.0.3
Werkzeug version: 0.15.4
Yes I realize that in the API documentation it explicitly says this won't work, yet it used to in older version of flask (at least when using app.run()). Perhaps this is more a of feature request?
