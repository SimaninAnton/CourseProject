In http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/#windows-easy-install the distribute_setup.py link looks like the domain owner didn't renew or lost the site so the script is not there.
I looked elsewhere for a good script, not sure which one would be the best to think to. A lot of the sites that also host the script just look fishy but could be options.
