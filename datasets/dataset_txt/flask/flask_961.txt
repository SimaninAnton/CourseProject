in flask doc's giving examples, the view would look like this:
class UserAPI(MethodView):

    def get(self, user_id):
        if user_id is None:
            # return a list of users
            pass
        else:
            # expose a single user
            pass

    def post(self):
        # create a new user
        pass

    def delete(self, user_id):
        # delete a single user
        pass

    def put(self, user_id):
        # update a single user
        pass
why not make it like this?
class UserAPI(MethodView):

    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id

    def get(self):
        if self.user_id is None:
            # return a list of users
            pass
        else:
            # expose a single user
            pass

    def post(self):
        # create a new user
        pass

    def delete(self):
        # delete a single user
        pass

    def put(self):
        # update a single user
        pass
the first way seems not simple and direct.
