As part of my PhD research on code authorship, we calculated the Truck Factor (TF) of some popular GitHub repositories.
As you probably know, the Truck (or Bus) Factor designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).
More details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233
We calculated the TF for Flask and obtained a value of 1.
The developer responsible for this TF is:
Armin Ronacher - author of 90% of the files
To validate our results, we would like to ask Flask developers the following three brief questions:
(a) Do you agree that the listed developer is the main developer of Flask?
(b) Do you agree that Flask will be in trouble if the listed developer leave the project (e.g., if he wins in the lottery, to be less morbid)?
(c) Does Flask have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developer (e.g., detailed documentation)?
Thanks in advance for your collaboration,
