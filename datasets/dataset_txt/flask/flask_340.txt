This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.
Please use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general
questions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.
If you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide
any any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create an MCVE, which helps us
understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in
your code.
Expected Behavior
There is an "old type" import statement in flask_cache/jinja2ext.py
import flask_cache.jinja2ext
Actual Behavior
jinja2ext.py does "from flask.ext.cache import make_template_fragment_key" which is referring to
an old module structure - flask.ext.cache has moved to flask_cache, hasn't it?
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/jensand/ve_unpin/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask_cache/jinja2ext.py", line 33, in <module>
    from flask.ext.cache import make_template_fragment_key
ImportError: No module named ext.cache
Environment
Python version: 2.7.12
Flask version: 1.0.2
Flask-Cache: 0.13.1
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
