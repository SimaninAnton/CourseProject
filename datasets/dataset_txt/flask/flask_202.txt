Expected Behavior
Creating an app using dash which is built onto of flask. App worked fine until I had the genius idea to try running it in the background. I'm now in a situation where I cannot use my app in development mode in cygwin, although it does work on main OS and deployed on server, so this isn't an issue w/codebase.
Sorry, this is only reproduceable in my environment
Actual Behavior
 $ python app.py
Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
Debugger PIN: 962-843-370
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
