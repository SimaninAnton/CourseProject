Command "routes" is available at https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/flask/cli.py#L798 but not documented. I tried it here, locally and it did not work ('function' object has no attribute 'make_context'). Not sure if I'm missing something or if the command is broken. Anyways, reporting.
Environment
Flask version: 0.12.x
