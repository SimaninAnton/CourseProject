There seems to be two main issues with this page.
I'm not sure how to say it, but the prose is vague and lacks focus. The effect in any case is that the concepts are difficult to grasp. [1] [2] [3]
Syntax errors and wordiness [4] [5] [6]
[1] "The application setup state in which the application implicitly is on the module level."
[2] "In contrast, during request handling, a couple of other rules exist"
[3] "There is a third state which is sitting in between a little bit."
[4] "The main reason for the application’s context existence is that in the past a bunch of functionality was attached to the request context in lack of a better solution. Since one of the pillar’s of Flask’s design is that you can have more than one application in the same Python process."
[5] "To make an application context there are two ways."
[6] "The context is typically used to cache resources on there that need to be created on a per-request or usage case."
