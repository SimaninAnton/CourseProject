I've done some homework and read up on #2450. I don't really understand the rationale behind that PR, and I don't think it really helps with Flask usage overall. To explain a bit...
I maintain a relatively complex project that builds its own API on top of Flask. This change heavily breaks our application structure, as we currently use dots as separators for view classes under our blueprints. Consider the following:
You have sets of blueprints - we use one for each subdomain
Each blueprint has a name - for example, main
Under a blueprint might be a logical section - for example, there might be an "about" section, so let's call this main.about
The logical section will have pages under it - to me, the logical thing to do is use more dots as separators, so main.about.privacy for example
Now, one solution would be to use some other separator. Why not about/privacy? about-privacy? The thing is, regardless of what separator you decide to use there, blueprints must always be separated from the view name using a .. So in, url_for() for example, we would have to use url_for("main.about/privacy"), which just looks plain ugly.
Some sample code
A sample route:
So, to summarize, here's what I'm asking:
Why exactly was this change made in the first place?
What should we be doing otherwise?
