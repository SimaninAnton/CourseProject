I was surprised to see that though flask.json.JSONEncoder accepts datetime objects, it ignores the timezone. I checked werkzeug.http.http_date and it can handle timezone aware dates just fine if they are passed in, but the JSONEncoder insists on transforming the datetime to a timetuple, like this
return http_date(o.timetuple())
This means i have to convert all my dates to utc before encoding them, otherwise I should overwrite the dafault() method in the encoder. Can you help me understand why the encoder was made to function with naive dates only?
Thx
