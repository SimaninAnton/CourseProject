With click integrated in to Flask 1.0, the published documentation at readthedocs is getting rather out of sync with 0.10 reality.
Specifically, today I could not link someone to the documentation on how to enable debug=True in their dev server, as the quickstart section on Debug Mode changed, and the 0.8 documentation is... outdated for 0.10 in places.
Can a 0.10 version of the docs be published too?
