I learned from multiple issues (like postmanlabs/httpbin#340, pallets/werkzeug#1149, #367) that Flask developers are making a push to implement wsgi.input_terminated as a way for wsgi servers and apps to support chunked requests.
However, it is extremely hard to navigate these issues and figure out what works and what does not. Is there an intention to document the support for this flag? This is a great feature, but from the user's perspective it is currently very hard to even figure out how it works. I propose at least keeping an issue alive with information on which environments will support it.
Here is what worked for me:
Flask 0.12.2 + Gunicorn 19.7.1
Flask 0.12.2 + Werkzeug 0.13
What did not work for me
Flask 0.12.2 + uWSGI 2.0.15
