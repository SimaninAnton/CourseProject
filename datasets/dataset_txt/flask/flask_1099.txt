On http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/api/#flask.send_file the following is suggested:
Please never pass filenames to this function from user sources without checking them first. Something like this is usually sufficient to avoid security problems:
if '..' in filename or filename.startswith('/'):
       abort(404)
This is terrible advice. It would be much better to tell people that if they want to pass in filenames, they should use http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/api/#flask.send_from_directory instead.
