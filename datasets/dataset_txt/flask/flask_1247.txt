Databases support not just DateTime objects but also Date and Time objects, but Flask's jsonify doesn't:
TypeError: datetime.time(0, 0) is not JSON serializable
This would be an easy pull request, but I want to check if it's been discussed before. Is there any reason why I should not add support for datetime.time and datetime.date objects to JSONEncoder?
