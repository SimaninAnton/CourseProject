Hello,
flask stable version 0.12 , docs doesn't cover this. Only dev version has , which not work for 0.12.
I want to change the logging format , after I add below code
    steam_formatter = logging.Formatter("[STREAM][%(levelname)s][%(asctime)s][%(name)s][Line:%(lineno)d] %(message)s")
    stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    stream_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    stream_handler.setFormatter(steam_formatter)
    app.logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
I find flask would print two log message with different format . Soon I understand flask still keep its original stream handler . I think reset logging format should be clarified in stable docs.
