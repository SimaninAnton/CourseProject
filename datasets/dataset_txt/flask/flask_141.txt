Werkzeug's EnvironBuilder gained a json_dumps attribute, but Flask doesn't have an EnvironBuilder subclass right now to take advantage of that, and there's no way to configure the Client to use a different builder class anyway. Might be good to refactor flask.testing.make_test_environ_builder to be an EnvironBuilder subclass at some point, rather than a factory wrapper.
