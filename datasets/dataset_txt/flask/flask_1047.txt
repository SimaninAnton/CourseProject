My suggestion would be to add a method to the class that lets you register custom types, e.g. like this:
session_json_serializer.register_type('md', MultiDict)
This would use the ' md' prefix when encountering a MultiDict object (type(x) is MultiDict as subclasses probably shouldn't be handled). To serialize/deserialize I'd simply use __getstate__ and __setstate__.
