Hi everyone!
Since I updated werkzeug to 0.10.1 this morning reloader stopped working. Is any specific configuration required besides installing watchdog?
I run with:
run_simple(
        hostname='0.0.0.0',
        port=5000,
        application=app,
        use_reloader=True,
        use_debugger=True,
        reloader_type='watchdog'
    )

# * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
# * Restarting with inotify reloader
I'm under vagrant and tried both with and without NFS to no success.
