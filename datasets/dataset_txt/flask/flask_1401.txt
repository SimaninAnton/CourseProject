I would appreciate listing and review for approval of Flask-MakeStatic, code and documentation are available. The extension supports 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 and due to the latter requires Flask 0.10. Tests are included and can be run with setup.py test (which installs dependencies) and make test (which does not.)
