I have noticed a rather weird error when installing a package that has Flask in install_requires. Here is the partial output of python setup.py install
Searching for Flask
Best match: Flask RESTful-0.2.12
Downloading https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/F/Flask-RESTful/Flask-RESTful-0.2.12.tar.gz#md5=53049771f4ccb3f40194696bb683db77
Processing Flask-RESTful-0.2.12.tar.gz
Writing /tmp/easy_install-ljhjqn/Flask-RESTful-0.2.12/setup.cfg
Running Flask-RESTful-0.2.12/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-ljhjqn/Flask-RESTful-0.2.12/egg-dist-tmp-4d1snj
Flask-RESTful 0.2.12 is already the active version in easy-install.pth

Installed /home/ayrx/.virtualenvs/test/lib/python3.3/site-packages/Flask_RESTful-0.2.12-py3.3.egg
error: Could not find required distribution Flask
Here is the relevant bit of setup.py
    install_requires=[
        "Flask",
        "Flask-RESTful",
        "cryptography"
    ]
Changing "Flask" to "flask" seems to fix things. Not a breaking bug but seems weird nonetheless especially since the packaging docs seem to indicate that "Flask" works fine.
