When making Flask 1.0, could you remove some old APIs?
deprecate flask.ext, see #1484 and #1135
remove modules, see #1204 and #861
deprecate *_session()
Allow all objects in JSON, see #673, #1177, #248, #170, #510
deprecate request.json, see #1206 and #1204
remove support for name guessing from send_file #1427
