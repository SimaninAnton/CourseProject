In the contributing guide we request people to use Black to autoformat their code via pre-commit.
However, there is no check for this on Azure Pipelines, meaning it is not checked automatically by GitHub for each pull request. This means style issues can be merged, requiring unrelated style fixes in later commits.
In tox.ini there is a stylecheck target. We should configure this to run on Azure Pipelines.
