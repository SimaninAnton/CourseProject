When using url_for with _external argument set to "True", the returned url does not contain the port which defaults the url to port 80.
I have read a few posts regarding this and it was because people were not specifying the full "SERVER_NAME" but I didn't set it.
At first, I was creating an app context to use url_for but it told me I had to set my server name but I can't set it as it might be dynamic upon a user configuration.
Anyhow, what I did was to create an app context and create a test_request context to use url_for which gave me the whole URL without the port.
