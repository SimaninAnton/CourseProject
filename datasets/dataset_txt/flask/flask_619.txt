We should make sure we're providing good, thorough security defaults, or at least documentation on the available options. Not sure if this fits better as Flask config, Werkzeug middleware, or a separate Flask-HTTP-Security extension.
Overview of HTTP security headers: https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html
Django's security options: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/security/ (some things, such as CSRF and SQL are handled by other libraries, not Flask)
As a first step, good for beginners, it would be nice to get a writeup here of what's already covered and what's not.
