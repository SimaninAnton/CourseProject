I'm preparing for my PyCon tutorial, for which I'm trying to look at things from the perspective of a beginner. The output of flask run is actually very confusing if you don't have a bit of background. Here is an example:
(venv) $ flask run
* Environment: production
  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
First of all, is this a development server? How would you know if you are new to Flask? And more importantly, we are told that we shouldn't use the development server in a production environment. But the line right above appears to claim the current environment is production!
I would like to propose a rewording of this warning to avoid ambiguous terms such as "environment". My proposal:
  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
Thoughts?
