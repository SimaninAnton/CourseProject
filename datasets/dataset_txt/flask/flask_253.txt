Expected Behavior
Flask should be able to read session data
Actual Behavior
with itsdangerous >= 1.0.0 flask cannot read session data if the session data was written by itsdangerous < 1.0.0
Session: <SecureCookieSession {}>
itsdangerous.exc.BadTimeSignature is being raised and then caught here
itsdangerous is allowed to bump major versions
itsdangerous recently changed its digest_method
This digest method is now wrong
Environment
Python version: Python 2.7.6
Flask version: 0.10.1
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
itsdangerous version: 1.1.0
