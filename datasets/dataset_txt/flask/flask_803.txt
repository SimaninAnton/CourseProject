In the upgrade docs, easy_install is listed as the example to use to upgrade:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/upgrading/
But in the installation docs, both pip and easy_install are listed, though pip is used more and is recommended:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/installation/
I would recommend the upgrading section be switched to use pip.
