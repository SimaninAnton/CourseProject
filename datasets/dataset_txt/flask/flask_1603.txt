Hi,
I've got a issue about static file.
When I put css file in /static/css/style.css in static directory and I described view function with Variable Rules.
Please see sample code on https://gist.github.com/1254213
GET /static/css/style.css request dispatch to view function and css file did not send to browser correctly.
I expected to GET /static/css/style.css should send css file to browser, not dispatch to view function.
Regards.
