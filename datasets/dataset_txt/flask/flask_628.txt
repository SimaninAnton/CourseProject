Versions
Python 3.6.1
Flask 0.12.1
Werkzeug 0.12.1
Issue
A catch-all error handler (one that catchesException), does not catch werkzeug.exceptions.BadRequestKeyError. Here's a very quick illustration of the issue:
https://github.com/sampeka/flask-issue
Steps to repoduce:
Clone the repo above, install requirements etc
Run python ./example.py
Navigate to /good, see that the error handler is correctly called
Navigate to /bad, see that the error handler is not called
If I define an error handler specifically for BadRequestKeyError it will be called, as expected.
Edit: If you downgrade to Flask==0.10.1, this example will work.
