I did not have __init__.py present. I did not know whether .py to be part of server_config as filename.
Friction for new user can be reduced by giving a more precise example, like:
app.config.from_object('module.server_config')
files:
module/__init__.py (may be empty)
module/server_config.py
Let server_config.py contain the following:
DEBUG = False
TESTING = False
DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite://:memory:'
user = 'Aladdin' 
However, app.config will carry only UPPERCASE keys (KEY=value) in config file.
Hence, app.config['DATABASE_URI'] will be set, app.config['user'] not.
