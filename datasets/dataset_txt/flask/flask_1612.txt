In Flask 0.7.2, I have a route defined as:
@app.route('/venues/<float:lat>/<float:lon>/<float:rad>/')
Trying to access that route at http://127.0.0.1/10/20/30 will produce a "404 Not Found" error. If you change the route to
@app.route('/venues/<lat>/<lon>/<rad>/')
or substitute int for float using the conversion notation, then the route works correctly.
