Since Werkzeug 0.9, request.form is populated for all requests as long as they contain a Content-Type header (https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/master/werkzeug/wrappers.py#L328).
The Flask documentation however implies that request.form is only available with POST and PUT requests, and that is the case with Werkzeug<0.9 (well, 0.8.3 parses for POST, PUT and PATCH).
