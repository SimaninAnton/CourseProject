I am trying to follow the basic Flask tutorial online and getting a weird error; I've searched for a fix online but haven't seen anyone with this issue with Flask:
C:\Users\Gregory Gundersen\Documents\Research\flask-test>python run.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "run.py", line 2, in <module>
    from app import app
  File "C:\Users\Gregory Gundersen\Documents\Research\flask-test\app\__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    from flask import Flask

    from .app import Flask, Request, Response

    import hmac
  File "C:\Python27\lib\hmac.py", line 8, in <module>
    from operator import _compare_digest as compare_digest
  ImportError: cannot import name _compare_digest
Thoughts?
