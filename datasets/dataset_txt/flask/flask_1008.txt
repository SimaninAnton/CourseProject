Hi.
I wrote a post about benchmarking some web frameworks and found a strange bug in Flask.
Requests per seconds were very low and not above 600 req/s. @miguelgrinberg contacted me about it and first thought that the issue was on my side but he also experienced the same behaviour.
Here is the Link to the Blogpost:

Something might be blocking requests in Flask or Werkzeug.
I am willing to help towards inverstigation.
Cheers Bijan
