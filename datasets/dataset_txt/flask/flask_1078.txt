Hey guys, I don't know if this is the right place to make this bug report, but I could sure use some help, I have been banging my head against a wall for a bit. See this repo where I'm reproducing my error: https://github.com/bepetersn/special-repo.
I'm seeing weird behavior around the Flask request object. After uploading a file with the requests library, e.g. requests.post(uri, files=<my_files>), by the time the request propagated to my view function, request.files was empty. Oddly, I observed that the contents of the file itself was available under request.form[None].
My only lead was that when I debugged this at length, I saw that the request data was being treated as a mimetype of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" rather than the correct "multipart/form" for uploading binary files... But, I just threw this example together really quickly, and I'm not seeing that right now, so I'm no longer sure.
I've also seen some other errors on this repo involving calling request.data vs request.form. I don't really know anything about that. I'd greatly appreciate a pointer in the right direction.
