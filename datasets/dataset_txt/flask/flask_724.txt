Hi,
when handling large file uploads +300MB, the files seem to be cached in memory till the upload is finished. This is not very practical.
The doc states:
(...) So how exactly does Flask handle uploads? Well it will store them in the webserver’s memory if the files are reasonable small otherwise in a temporary location
I am unsure on how to interpret this, but as I saw it: cache the data on disk till the file is uploaded, before moving on. :-)
So my question is: is storing everything in memory during upload, intended behaviour?
To give a little more details on the code:
def store_upload(project_id):
    file = request.files['file']
    # boiler plate checks ...
    file.save(os.path.join(destination_base, destination))  #save file to decent location
    return _response_stuff()
I am using python 3.5, flask 0.11.1.
PS: I went through #pocoo and github issues here, but couldn't find any answer matching my request
Thanks!
