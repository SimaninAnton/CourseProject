On python 3.4.3 with flask-0.10.1, running the demo in the quickstart doesn't print what port it's on:
$ python helloworld.py
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger pin code: 281-051-764
it is on port 5000, so you can guess it from the docs, but I think it should tell the user what port it's running on?
