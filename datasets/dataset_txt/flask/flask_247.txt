On latest PyPI's release (1.0.2), using logging's root logger before running Flask breaks its logging.
For example, with such a run.py file:
import logging
import flask

logging.info("it breaks")
flask.Flask(__name__).run()
python run.py outputs this:
 * Serving Flask app "run" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
and then stops any kind of logging.
The application is running and answering, but you don't get the Running on http://... line, nor any request logging.
It's worth noting that using the root logger inside a route doesn't break Flask.
