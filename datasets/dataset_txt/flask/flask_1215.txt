If I do following:
app = Flaks(__name__, static_folder='/var/www/static')
all works just fine, but if I do
class Config(object):
    FLASK_STATIC_FOLDER = '/var/www/static'

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)
current_app.send_static_file can't find static file. Is it any difference between those two settings?
