There are whole sections based on assumption that sqlite has no built-in DictCursor behavior
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/views/#tutorial-views
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/sqlite3/#easy-querying
Besides verbosity, by wrapping result in dict() we block transparent data passing to INSERT which waits for "tupled" format
Here is solution:
db = sqlite3.connect(app.config['DATABASE_NAME'])
db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row # trick!
While "print cur.fetchall()" still looks like tuples are here... don't worry, it supports key access:
for item in cur.fetchall():
print item['title'] # works!
So you can easily remove those custom wrappers which i saw copied here and there...
