If I try to search for “flash”, I get a 500 error:
http://flask.pocoo.org/search/?q=flash
I’ve found a few other searches related to flash that seem to fail; they may or may not be related:
Leading/trailing whitespace, e.g. “___flash” or “flash___”
Leading/trailing words with one or three characters – “a flash”, “big flash”, “flash a” and “flash big” all fail.
“flashe” and “flashes” both fail – appending other characters seems okay.
And some searches that work:
Prepending characters to “flash” – so “aflash”, “abflash”, “abcflash”, and so on seem to work.
Leading/trailing words with other numbers of characters – “hi flash”, “flash ab”, “flash abcd”, “high flash”, “highest flash” all work.
Repro’d in Safari and Chrome on OS X. I’m coming from a UK-based ISP, if that’s significant.
I was trying to search for the pages on message flashing. I couldn’t find a pattern to rejected searches, except that they all involve the word “flash”.
