I'm using Flask to implement an app that returns JSON for most requests including error responses for bad requests, page not found, etc.
To do this I wrapped the default handle_http_exception method of the app similar to how it was handled in the Flask_exceptional module https://github.com/jzempel/flask-exceptional/blob/master/flask_exceptional.py so that I could return the Response as JSON rather than the default generated HTML.
What I found was that any views that used the Flask redirect function rendered the redirect as HTML. However, if you add a route which ends with a slash, Werkzeug's routing code will automatically fire off a RequestRedirect which would get caught by the handle_http_exception and rendered as JSON.
