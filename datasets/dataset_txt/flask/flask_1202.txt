It would be nice to have an app level config setting for defaulting _external to True in url_for on sites where absolute URLs are required or preferred, removing the need to add the parameter on each url_for call.
Possibly near here: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/helpers.py#L292:
if current_app.config['NEW_SETTING_NAME_HERE']:
    external = True
