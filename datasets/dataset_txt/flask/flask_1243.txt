in the example code of doc page
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/mongokit/
the formatted string expression in the exception has two %s placeholders but only one variable.

Here is an example document (put this also into app.py, e.g.):
def max_length(length):
def validate(value):
if len(value) <= length:
return True
raise Exception('%s must be at most %s characters long' % length)
return validate
