The module branch support variable modules. Something like this:
wiki = Module(__name__, url_prefix='/<user>')
Then each function registered is passed 'user' as first parameter. This already works as far as I can see, however it would be better if that value can be attached to g instead. What should work (not tested) is this:
@wiki.before_request
def attach_user():
    g.wiki_user = request.view_args.pop('user', None)
The problem with this is that URLs generated still need that user attached, so url_for needs some kind of support for that. However I am not entirely sure how that should look like.
