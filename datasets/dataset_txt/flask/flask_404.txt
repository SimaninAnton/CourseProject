The commands run and shell are behaving differently to locate the app, I can send a PR but first I want to confirm if this is a problem or expected behavior.
Expected Behavior
Assuming the tree
/topdir
|____/appdir
|_________/app.py 
then
export FLASK_APP=app.py
cd topdir
If you run
flask run
The command can find the app in the subfolder and run successfully
Expected the same to happen for shell
cd topdir
flask shell
>>> 
Actual Behavior
cd topdir
flask shell

# in 0.12.2
Error: The file/path provided (app.py) does not appear to exist.  Please verify the path is correct.  If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py

# n 0.13.dev
Error: Could not import "app"."
Looks like the run command is traversing the subfolders to locate an app while the shell command is not doing the same.
and the same applies for the new routes on master
$ cd topdir
$ flask routes                                                          
Usage: flask routes [OPTIONS]

Error: Could not import "app"."
Environment
Python version: 3.6.0
Flask version: 0.12.2 & 0.13.dev (master branch)
Werkzeug version: 0.14.1
