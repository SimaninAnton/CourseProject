From line https://github.com/pallets/flask/blame/master/docs/patterns/packages.rst#L123 to https://github.com/pallets/flask/blame/master/docs/patterns/packages.rst#L133 circular imports are discussed, correctly pointing out that in the example, one has been introduced. However, surely that could be avoided if instead the views file ised a Blueprint, removing the dependency on the Flask object app
(For reference here is the same page: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.21/patterns/packages/)
