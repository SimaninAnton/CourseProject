I'm having this small issue where match route by type int matches actually unsigned int
Expected Behavior
Doing a request with negative integer should match the route
@app.route('/by_user/<int:user_id>', methods=["GET"])
def handle_user(user_id):
  # rest of the code
Actual Behavior
when doing a GET request to the server, with the path /by_user/-1 it won't match
when doing with unsigned int /by_user/1 it works
Environment
Python version: Python 3.6.3
Flask version: Flask 0.12.2
Note
I'm running the server via gunicorn, if it matters
Thanks a lot
