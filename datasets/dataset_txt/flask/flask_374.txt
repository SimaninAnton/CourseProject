Expected Behaviour
When the request is over, the incoming files and JSON should be removed from memory
Actual Behavior
The files and other request data is left in memory with no apparent way to close the objects. i have tried using the python garbage collector but that fails to find the files and other related data.
The memory is silently used up until flask is killed by the host
Environment
Python version: 3.6
Flask version: 1.0.2
Werkzeug version: 2.10
