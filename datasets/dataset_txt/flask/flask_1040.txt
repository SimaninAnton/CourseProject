The imp module has been deprected in 3.4 and seem to be used in 2 places : flask/config.py and scripts/flaskext_compat.py to create modules.
It should be easy to replace with types.ModuleType(name) I guess.
discovered because I'm running with -W error on another project, which change the warning in errors, and I fail here even before reaching the other lib where I'm trying to find where the warning are coming from.
I'll try to see if i can send PR to fix that,
Thanks
