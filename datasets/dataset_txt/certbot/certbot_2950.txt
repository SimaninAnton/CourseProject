I am trying running the following command:
./letsencrypt-auto --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --help
And I get:
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: sudo /home/koffe/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-dev-preview
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/var/aegir/platforms/20151024/.htaccess', u'Syntax error'),)
With a verbose output:
Requested authenticator apache and installer apache
Other error:(PluginEntryPoint#apache): ('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/var/aegir/platforms/20151024/.htaccess', u'Syntax error')
