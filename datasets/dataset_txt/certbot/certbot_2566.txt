Hi,
I have successfully installed a Letsencrypt certificate for an owncloud server using the --apache automated method. I am running a Debian 8 system.
However, I am now not able to gain access to my webmin web interface. Firefox throws up a warning of an untrusted cert (the default webmin one) and does not give the option to add an exemption.
Any ideas on how to resolve the issue would be greatly received.
