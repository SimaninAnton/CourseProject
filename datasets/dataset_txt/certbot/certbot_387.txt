While investigating #1698, I found that you still can't successfully symlink certbot-auto elsewhere, although the error message that we get nowadays is quite different!
There is some problem when running sudo on a symlink. E.g.
ln -s /bin/ls /tmp/ls
/tmp/ls
works fine, but then sudo /tmp/ls fails. In the same way, when certbot-auto tries to re-run itself with sudo, it fails.
