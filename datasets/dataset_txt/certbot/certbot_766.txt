My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
I installed certbot from the instructions on the certbot page, and then updated it using pip to version 0.21.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot
Output: I have exceeded the renewal rate limit
certbot --staging
Output: Client with the currently selected authenticator does not support any combination of challenges that will satisfy the CA.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It should have renewed my certs OR reported an issue. Instead, it simply said it was unable to connect to the server and now reports that I've exceeded the rate limit. How can I exceed the rate limit if it was unable to connect?
This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Even when the rate limit expires, I still do not expect to be able to renew since the staging command also produces errors.
