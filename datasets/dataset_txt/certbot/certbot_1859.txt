Ran certbot certonly and got an error.
$ certbot certonly
An unexpected error occurred:
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt'
Please see the logfile 'certbot.log' for more details.
but doing which letsencrypt returns /usr/local/bin/letsencrypt
Using OSX 10.11.6 and installed using certbot using homebrew.
