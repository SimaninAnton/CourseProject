Certbot often tries to determine the underlying OS and changes its default behavior and config values to match. These defaults often show up in our documentation though which means that the documentation changes based on who built it.
In #6120, we introduced the environment variable CERTBOT_DOCS to avoid this behavior and print the same defaults in our documentation regardless of the system it is run on. We added this to nginx in #6137. We don't do this in Apache though as can be seen at #6232 (comment).
We should respect CERTBOT_DOCS in the Apache plugin.
