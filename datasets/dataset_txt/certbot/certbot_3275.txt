Since #843 was not pulled in, we need ways of allowing people to run the client without root for the following cases:
letsencrypt plugins, possibly other subcommands
letsencrypt -a manual auth or anything else using Manual Authenticator: paranoid people don't want to run our code as sudo - we should make it easy for them to do that
in general, plugins might not require sudo at all: #496 is an example, but we can't anticipate for what reasons 3rd party plugins would not require root, so we need a generic solution.
Assigning to @pde.
