When I run ./letsencrypt-auto I get this output:
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt
An unexpected error occurred:
ImportError: Unable to import libaugeas!
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
I got letsencrypt by git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.git into directory /opt.
When I run bootstrap/debian.sh everything is the newest version.
apt-get install libaugeas0 and apt-get install libffi-dev also tells me everything is the newest version.
I'm running ReadyNAS OS 6.4.1 which is some kind of Debian. I run every command as root.
apt-get install letsencrypt returns Unable to locate package letsencrypt
