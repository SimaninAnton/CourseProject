It's pretty painful to set a txt record for each subdomain wanted.
My case for instance:
.it domain
.com domain
subdomains dev., stg., www.* and [empty].*
I have to set 8 txt records, one for each of them! Why not giving the chance to set just 1 txt record for domain and having certbox check automatically for a common txt record?
