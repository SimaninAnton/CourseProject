The documentation page for ArchLinux appears to be incorrect or outdated. The first step says to install the 'letsencrypt' package, but this doesn't exist in the Arch or AUR repositories:
> pacman -Ss letsencrypt
> packer -Ss letsencrypt
aur/letsencrypt.sh-git 0.2.0.r4.gd5b2858-1 (4)
    A Let's Encrypt (ACME protocol) client shell script
aur/letsencrypt-systemd-nginx 1.0-2 (2)
    Systemd service for Let's Encrypt certificate renewal with nginx servers
aur/ca-certificates-letsencrypt 20160325-1 (1)
    Let's Encrypt CA certificates
aur/letsencrypt-cli 0.3.0-1 (0)
    Yet another Letsencrypt (ACME) client using Ruby.
Several other matching options do show up in AUR. But as it stands, the instructions written on the doc page do not work so a first time user would have to some searching and then trial and error experimentation with these various clients, instead of having a straightforward documented user experience.
I did find a certbot package that is related to letsencrypt, although it is a different command binary than what listed in the doc page ("certbot" instead of "letsencrypt"). The command usage seems similar, though. Not sure if this should be the official client listed in the documentation instead?
