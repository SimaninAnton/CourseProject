Inspired by https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/forward-secrecy-imc16.pdf, we might want to look into changing our nginx plugin's behavior around TLS session tickets. The Mozilla site where we get our TLS config from has TLS session tickets disabled, but this setting is not present in our config file at https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/options-ssl-nginx.conf.
This is likely due to the minimum version Nginx that supports these settings, however, I don't believe this has been investigated for a while. We should see what version these settings were added to Nginx and what versions are available in major distros.
Even if support is not available everywhere yet, it is probably worth adding these values conditionally as I suspect it will work on the vast majority of systems.
