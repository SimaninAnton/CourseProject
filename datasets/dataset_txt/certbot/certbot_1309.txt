About certbot-auto command line interface.
Current behaviour
If use --quiet option, I get no output at all (as long as there are no errors).
If I do not use --quiet option, the output is fairly verbose:

Cert not yet due for renewal

The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/blaah.com/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
No hooks were run.
Desired behaviour
I'm running certbot-auto renew inside a cron job. And I would like to see output from certbot-auto in case of either an error or in case certbot actually renewed some certificate. This would make it easier to troubleshoot the cron job. Also, as the actual renewal only happens once per month, it is not too much output. At least for me.
So, I would like a --print-renewals flag (used in combination with --quiet flag) that would allow be to tell certbot-auto to print out information about attempted renewals and their result (success or failure). And, in case no renewal is needed, certbot would not output anything (as is usual with --quiet flag).
