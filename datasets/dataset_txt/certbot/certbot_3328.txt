We need to figure out how the renewer will be configured to run automatically regardless of how the user installs Let's Encrypt. When prepared for use with an operating system package manager, this setup should be done by the package maintainer.
If installed through something like PyPI, we should help the user with this configuration. This could be anything from providing documentation to attempting to automate the process for the user (after getting their approval). Another idea is to include crontabs, systemd timers, etc. with Let's Encrypt to help the user through the process. Regardless of how this done, we should help the user with this instead of leaving them to figure it out on their own.
