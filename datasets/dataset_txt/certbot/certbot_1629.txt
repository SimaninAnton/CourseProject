Hey there, I installed certbot as per the doc's from letsencrypt on Debian Jessie and certbot in manual mode returns:
certbot certonly --manual -d mydomain.com
An unexpected error occurred:
TypeError: __str__ returned non-string (type Error)
pip2 list
acme (0.9.3)
...
certbot (0.9.3)
cryptography (1.5.3)
...
pyOpenSSL (16.0.0)
Anyone seen this before and can offer a solution? Thanks
