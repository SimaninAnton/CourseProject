I ran the following commands and both complained that nginx was already using port 80.
./letsencrypt-auto --standalone --dvsni-port 63443 --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
./letsencrypt-auto --standalone --dvsni-port 63443 --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --standalone-supported-challenges dvsni auth
I was under the impression that using --dvsni-port would force dvsni only.
I had to supply a fake port with --simple-http-port 9999 with the second commad to get a certificate.
I'm using haproxy in the front to redirect *.acme.invalid to port 63443.
