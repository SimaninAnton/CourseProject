I have wasted several hours and hopefully my time won't be totally lost by sharing my feedback.
I agreed to this and the tool keeps prompting me for every (sub)domain I have on the list.
Why?
certbot-auto certonly --allow-subset-of-names -a manual --rsa-key-size 4096 -v -d domain.com -d www.domain.com
NOTE: The IP of this machine will be publicly logged as having requested this
certificate. If you're running certbot in manual mode on a machine that is not
your server, please ensure you're okay with that.
When a certificate doesn't verify prompt the user again and not just fail.
If you try to use --nginx this fails miserably so I have used manual mode
there has to be an option that would generate a list of files so I don't have to manually create those.
There has to be a better process for authenticating subdomains. The files should end in .txt so they can be easily downloaded.
the output of the manual file should also be .crt and key files and not just a bunch of .json files.
