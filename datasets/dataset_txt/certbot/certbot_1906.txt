certbot-auto and letsencrypt-auto in the root of our repo should only be modified during our releases, however, this is not enforced by any of our tests. It should be enforced by something running in Travis.
Probably the easiest way to do that is to use letsencrypt-auto-source/pieces/fetch.py to download the latest stable copy of the script and diff that against certbot-auto and letsencrypt-auto in the root. If they differ, the test should fail.
