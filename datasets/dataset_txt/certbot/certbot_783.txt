@sydneyli brought to my attention that the way we're telling developers to use certbot_test in https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client does not work. You cannot use certbot_test against the staging server because certbot_test uses alternate ports for challenges which isn't supported in staging.
In my opinion, we should remove the recommendation of using certbot_test entirely and tell people to run the client as root with the staging flag.
