There are currently three binaries installed system-wide in /usr/bin:
letsencrypt
jws
letsencrypt-renewer
The first one is obviously what end-users will be using, but what about the other two? Are they internal binaries used by other tools / cron jobs?
If so, then in Debian, they will need to live somewhere like /usr/lib/letsencrypt/ or /usr/share/letsencrypt. Do we need extra config somewhere to let the tools find these binaries or should I run the right files through sed to fix the paths?
