Right now the Travis tests are very slow. Most runs today took about 2 hours 46 minutes of wall time. This is mainly due to the macOS tests, which wait in an overcrowded Travis queue for a limited number of macOS instances. Additionally, once they run, they take about 12 minutes apiece. Also, the Boulder integration tests take about 12 minutes, and we run one for each Python version, when we usually only need to run 1.
My proposal is to remove the macOS and all but one of the Boulder integration test jobs from the main Travis build. We would create a separate branch called heavy-tests that would keep these tests in, and configure it as a Travis cron to run nightly. This branch would have an additional before_install step that would merge the latest master, so we would not need to update it manually (except for .travis.yml changes).
