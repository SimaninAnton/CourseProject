Running "./letsencrypt-auto certonly --manual -c cli.ini" shows the below message template for each domain listed in cli.ini.
MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = """
Make sure your web server displays the following content at
{uri} before continuing:
{validation}
If you don't have HTTP server configured, you can run the following
command on the target server (as root):
{command}
I am running letsencrypt on my local machine to create certificates for my domains, which are hosted on a foreign server.
Currently I need to copy "abcd.efgh" of the below terminal output into a text editor and save it into a the file "abcd".
"printf "%s" abcd.efgh > .well-known/acme-challenge/abcd"
This must to be done for each domain name listed in cli.ini.
It would be better if I could pass an additional parameter like:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --manual -c cli.ini --validation-path ~/tmp/
In that case letsencrypt would create automatically all the validation files inside ~/tmp/.
Than it would stop and notify the user, that he can upload now these files via FTP to his server.
After file transfer is finished the user hits on OK inside letsencrypt and the validation starts.
