For instance, if the user type "letsencrypt --standalone", the plugin selection stack is as follows:
cli.choose_configurator_plugins()
display.ops.pick_installer()
display.ops.pick_plugin()
display.ops.choose_plugin()
iDisplay.menu()
Probably that stack is two functions deeper than it needs to be...
