I did an strace on a letsencrypt run (see also #168) and found that it opens and reads about every file that lives in /etc (+ some more dotfiles).
Including, but not limited to, a lot of files that contain plaintext passwords, sudo configuration and other sensitive information that letsencrypt does definitely not need for operation. I expected it to look at apache/webserver stuff, but it also read ALL my wireless passwords (for example).
What would you think of a tool behaving like this?
Update: just to clarify: it is not the letsencrypt code that reads all the files, but the default behaviour of the augeas config parsing/editing library that is used by letsencrypt.
