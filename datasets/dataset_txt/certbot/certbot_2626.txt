Dear all, I have created this repo with a service that can create certificates behind a load balancer without breaking the deployment. I would be interested in feedback.
https://github.com/Levino/letsencrypt-cert-service
It is also available on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/levino/letsencrypt-cert-service/
