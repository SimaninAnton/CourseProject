Currently, if a developer is testing the client, and the staging server has wiped old test accounts, the user's client will error out with a mysterious Error: malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Unable to read/verify body message.
Once boulder has started sending a more sensible error, the client should respond by telling the user (1) you'd better be in dev mode; (2) please rm -rf /etc/letsencrypt/accounts
