As reported by @joohoi in #3890:
If the hook points to a actual script, which is not executable a somewhat uninformative error is shown to user:
Unable to find --auth-hook command /tmp/non_executable.sh in the PATH.
(PATH is /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin)
This is also a bit misleading, as having the script on $PATH isn't a requirement.
