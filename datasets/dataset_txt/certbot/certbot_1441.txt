I have a crontab job executing /opt/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto and it attempts to renew cert for a site (hostname) that doesn't exist.
I am running nginx server and I know the above fact because of log entry in my default site.
I was using that hostname before, but no longer.
How do I stop this? Or is it a bug on your part? Thanks.
