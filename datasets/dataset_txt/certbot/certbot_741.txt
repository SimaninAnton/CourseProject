The reverter and rollback commands are pretty unpleasant from a UX perspective right now. We could consider the option of working with server configs in git repos (either preexisting or make one for the user), which would allow a few things to be done better:
Provide a rich command line for winding forward and back that people might already know
Be able to record which changes were made by Certbot (indeed, which exact run of Certbot)
Be able to record and distinguish which changes were made by the user in between Certbot runs
