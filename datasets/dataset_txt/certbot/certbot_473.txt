There are 2 entries of certbot-route53 in docs/cli-help.txt.
One around line 496:
certbot-route53:auth: Obtain certificates using a DNS TXT record (if you are using AWS Route53 for DNS).
and another around line 615:
dns-route53: Obtain certificates using a DNS TXT record (if you are using AWS Route53 for DNS).
Should it be like that or should one be removed?
