After issuing a new cert, the client will get a link to the issuer cert using a link with rel="up". We expect that there will be multiple "up" links for the multiple intermediate certs. One intermediate cert will be signed by the ISRG Root. The other intermediate cert will be signed by the IdenTrust Root. In production rollout we'll want the client to choose the IdenTrust-signed intermediate, which will be trusted by real clients.
The client should probably fetch each issuer cert listed in an "up" link, parse it, and prioritize based on that intermediate's Issuer field, comparing it against a baked-in list of roots that it knows to be widely trusted.
