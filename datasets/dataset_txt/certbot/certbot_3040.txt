My domain hasn't got an MX-record in DNS but accepts Email at the A-record. This is conforming to standards, AFAIK.
The ACME-clients apparently mandatorily expects an MX-record. It fails with this:
An unexpected error occurred.                                                                                   
Error: malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Error creating new registration :: No MX record for domain $domain.
Is there any way around this other than adding an MX-record?
