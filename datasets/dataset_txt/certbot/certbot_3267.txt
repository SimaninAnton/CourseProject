People may decide to run, e.g. the manual authenticator from their laptop rather than from the server. This will work fine. However, the Let's Encrypt privacy policy states that we will retain and publish IP addresses associated with ACME validation requests, including requestor IP. This is unremarkable when running the client on the same machine where a cert will be deployed. When running the client on a personal machine, this behavior will be unexpected to anyone who hasn't read the privacy policy.
We should do a check that the resolved names being authorized point at the current machine. If they don't we should provide a notice to the user that their IP address will be published, along with a link to the privacy policy.
