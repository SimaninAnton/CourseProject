The --csr option seems to be doing strange things when used without certonly. It's asking me if I want to expand the certificate to have more hostnames and things like that. It seems to have generated it's own keypair again, it's own csr, and so on. That clearly wasn't what I wanted.
Maybe you're not supposed to run it in that mode?
