This is something I'd like to sooner rather than later as many of these tests are now irrelevant as they are testing old, sometimes EOL'd distros, and not testing more modern and popular ones. The lack of more modern tests has caused us to ship bugs.
@joohoi or especially @SwartzCr, this would be something useful for you to take off my plate.
