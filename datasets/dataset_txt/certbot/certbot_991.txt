My operating system is (include version):
Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
source
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto --no-self-upgrade --debug certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns
No TXT records found for DNS challenge
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I verified the TXT record on AWS before I ran the command and received DNS response code NOERROR with the expected UDP response value.
