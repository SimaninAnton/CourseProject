My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get (package manager)
Certbot is now on 0.39, the on in Ubuntu PPA is still on 0.31.
This is an issue as config-ssl-xxx.conf's have been updated to use TLS 1.3 for example. All "default" installed websites on Ubuntu through PPA still don't have that enabled.
See also #6770 as it basically reported the same thing a few months ago.
