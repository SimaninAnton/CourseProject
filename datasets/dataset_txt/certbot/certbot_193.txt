Per https://letsencrypt.org/2019/04/15/transitioning-to-isrg-root.html and https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-request-identrust-intermediate-ca/91323/1, some of our users will want to continue serving the intermediate signed by the DST root instead of the ISRG root even if the CA starts recommending the ISRG-signed intermediate.
It would be good to have a straightforward and documented way to allow people to do that.
As an alternative, we could have a way to opt in to the new chain instead of a way to opt out.
Or we could try to have a good general way to handle choosing among potentially available certificate chains.
