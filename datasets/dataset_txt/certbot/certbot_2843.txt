poll_and_request_issuance([authz1, authz2], max_attempt=1) is the simplest example, where the code fails, because max_attempts counts total number of attempts for all authorizations, instead of counting per authorization. With default limit of 10, this causes problems in practice - usually when people are using more than 10 domains.
Core is not affected, because it doesn't use this retry loop. https://github.com/kuba/simp_le, however, is (and any other client using our library).
