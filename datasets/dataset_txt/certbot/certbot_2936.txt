We have a report from someone issuing a cert with 90 names: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/solved-rate-limit-with-san-certificate-90-hostnames/4010/7. They said the screen seemed to hang while it was working on the challenges, so they killed it. If we don't already have some sort of "in progress" indicator we should add on.
