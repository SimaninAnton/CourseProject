On install on OSX, I have to use sudo to get past the xcode license.
$ ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server       https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
WARNING: Mac support is very experimental at present...


Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.


Error: Failure while executing: /usr/bin/otool -L /usr/bin/install_name_tool
But When I use sudo, brew fails
$ sudo ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server       https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth

You can use brew with sudo, but only if the brew executable is owned by root.
However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at
your own risk.
Sorry if this is already an issue, I tried to search for it and couldn't find one.
