@diracdeltas, do you think we could work with the upstream (I guess that's https://github.com/fatiherikli/nginxparser) to contribute back our changes and make sure nginxparser is released to PyPI (not there yet: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=Nginxparser&submit=search), rather than embedding the code directly within our source tree? I'm happy to help (with the packaging).
