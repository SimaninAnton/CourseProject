Hi,
We're running a mix variation of web servers and would prefer to use HTTP01 using the "webroot" authenticator. We're an HTTPS-only environment currently and not looking to change that, which offers a problem for us.
Could simple support for HTTP01 over HTTPS be added? You would need to disregard any certificate errors (allowing bootstrapping using self-signed certs etc.) on the server side I guess, but compared to HTTP that's not an issue.
