We're getting periodic reports that people on small-memory systems are unable to complete the installation process (using certbot-auto) because they get out-of-memory errors. (This is most common on a Raspberry Pi, but we've also gotten these reports from people using a memory-limited VPS configuration.)
This seems somewhat unreasonable to me; I don't understand why our resource requirements are so great.
