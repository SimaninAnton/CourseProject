Not sure when or where it started but on the forums, a few folks have got the incorrect idea than manual mode and webroot authentication doesn't need SSH/terminal access
but AFAIK, unless something has changed https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#plugins manual mode as well as webroot authentication still needs SSH/terminal access just not on the same server for manual ? That is still the case ?
