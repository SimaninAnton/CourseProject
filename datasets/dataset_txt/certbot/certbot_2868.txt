I ran
./letsencrypt-auto --help --debug
to install lets encrypt.
All packages successfully installed but then the following error occurs:
Creating virtual environment...
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......Command "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2.7 -c "import setuptools, tokenize;file='/dev/shm/pip-build-OslHtf/cffi/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(file).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), file, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-lx9pFX-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/include/site/python2.7/cffi" failed with error code 1 in /dev/shm/pip-build-OslHtf/cffi
Any idea? I realize amazon linux support is experimental and I don't intend to use all the automation tools (yet) but it would be great if I could at least get certificates generated manually.
