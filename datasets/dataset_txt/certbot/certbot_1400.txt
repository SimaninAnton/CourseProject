I'm using the s3front plugin and I set various args via the commandline (e.g. --certbot-s3front:auth-s3-bucket). However, these args are not saved in the renewal config file. So when certbot detects the cert needs renewing it fails as no args for the plugin were given.
Any ideas why this is?
(using 0.11.1)
