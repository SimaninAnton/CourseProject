Thanks for all your work on Let's Encrypt, it's fantastic!
I wrote a renew hook that would only be triggered by a certain domain. Renew hooks are a little tricky to get right since they get called infrequently (only at renewal time, usually every couple of months).
I assumed the lineage directory (RENEWED_LINEAGE) was /etc/letsencrypt/live, but it's really /etc/letsencrypt/live/$domain.
It would be awesome if the CLI help for --renew-hook had example values for these environment variables. It would give hook authors more confidence that they've got their code right.
Perhaps something like this:
the shell variable $RENEWED_LINEAGE will point to the config live subdirectory
(for example, "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com") containing the new certs and
keys; the shell variable $RENEWED_DOMAINS will contain a space-delimited list
of renewed cert domains (for example, "example.com www.example.com").
