I was attempting to determine if #443, was still a problem.
I ran letsencrypt --work-dir ../Downloads -vvvv run
I was left with the following error...
AH00526: Syntax error on line 10 of /etc/apache2/le_dvsni_cert_challenge.conf:
SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/Downloads/OwYVJOOHVxWaHWNpNUgNDy4TIafggji3RdP0SymKozo.crt' does not exist or is empty
Action 'configtest' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information. 
I thought it to be a peculiar place to be looking for a cert.
The config file is populated with...
def get_cert_path(self, achall):
        """Returns standardized name for challenge certificate.
        :param achall: Annotated DVSNI challenge.
        :type achall: :class:`letsencrypt.achallenges.DVSNI`
        :returns: certificate file name
        :rtype: str
        """
        return os.path.join(self.configurator.config.work_dir,
                            achall.chall.encode("token") + ".crt")
Thus, leading me to the conclusion that we do not handle our directories appropriately from the command-line. I think it would be much easier if all of the work_dir, config_dir, and logs_dir were guaranteed to be an absolute path.
Providing the full path off the command-line did solve the problem.
Can we find a place to normalize all paths?
