When I run letsencrypt install --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/cert.pem --key-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem --chain-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem with the following configuration https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9CrBQYK660GRm1EVVFoQzdIRFE/view?usp=sharing, installation fails. The reason for this is the dummy directives including things like insert_cert_file_path and insert_key_file_path are not removed before restarting Apache, causing it to fail.
