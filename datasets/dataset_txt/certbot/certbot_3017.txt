Running the letsencrypt script, I get an error when bootstrapping dependencies
$ ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server --debug       https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
./letsencrypt-auto: line 36: : command not found
I believe this is because the ExperimentalBootstrap invocation for Mac OS X does not require the sudo argument, so the command that is executed here is "" "/bootstrap/mac.sh".
