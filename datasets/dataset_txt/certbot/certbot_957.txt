My operating system is (include version):
FreeBSD 12.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
pkg install py27-certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
certbot renew --dry-run
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/certbot", line 6, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

pkg_resources.ContextualVersionConflict: (cryptography 1.7.2 (/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('cryptography>=1.9'), set(['PyOpenSSL']))
No matter what command I run, it outputs an error.
Is this a known issue on the version 12?
