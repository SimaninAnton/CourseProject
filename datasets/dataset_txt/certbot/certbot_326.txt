My operating system is (include version):
Centos 6
I am aware of issue #2902
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget
I ran this command and it produced this output:
export PATH=".:$PATH"
which python
/root/certbot/python
certbot-auto --no-bootstrap --apache certonly
WARNING: couldn't find Python 2.7+ to check for updates.
Creating virtual environment...
Cannot find any Pythons; please install one!
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Expected certbot to find and use Python v3.6 in current directory (like which).
ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 62298 Nov 26 21:53 certbot-auto
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 97 Nov 27 11:51 certbot.certonly.sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 24 Nov 27 11:43 python -> /usr/local/bin/python3.6
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
