If the client is obtaining certs for multiple names, it is possible to request one cert per name (controlled by SNI) or one cert for all names (using Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields in the cert). In theory if the webserver is smart enough, it should be possible to do both at once: if an SNI extension arrives in the handshake, send a small cert; if it doesn't, use the SAN cert.
