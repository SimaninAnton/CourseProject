I propose developing an ACME client for Windows + IIS.
Here are some of my thoughts:
Create a PowerShell-based solution, this would be comparable to the Python-based one already in the works for Linux/Apache (letsencrypt.py):
This will also be allow more compatibility with more environments, such as Windows Core, and even remote execution
Leverage the existing Windows components for any dependencies, for example under the hood, letsencrypt.py uses OpenSSL for all the cert management stuff, whereas on Windows you could use the certreq CLI or the CertEnroll API.
By structuring the code/libs nicely, we can make parts reusable outside of the main script, for example API/library for the ACME protocol itself to be used in other implementations or projects.
Try to mimic the letsencrypt.py command-line usage as much as possible/practical so that there is consistency across platforms letsencrypt.py CLI usage
