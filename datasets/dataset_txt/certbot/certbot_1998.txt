Failed authorization procedure. abc.xyz.net (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:unknownHost :: The server could not resolve a domain name :: No IPv4 addresses found for abc.xyz.net.
In fact abc.xyz.net (not real domain here) resolves just fine, both by DNS A record and locally since it's in the hosts file on the webserver. And it resolves to an IPv4 address. Is this because that address is in a private range (e.g. 172.16.x.x)? Are we not to be allowed valid certs for servers only reachable on our LAN? Whatever, the error message appears wrong.
