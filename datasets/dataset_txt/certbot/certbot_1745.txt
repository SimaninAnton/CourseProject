I generated a certificate using the following command:
./certbot-auto certonly --rsa-key-size 4096 --key-path tixit/privateKey.pem --webroot -w path/to/my/webroot -d <my domain 1> -d <my domain 2> -d <my domain 3> -d <my domain 4>
When I used the certificate fullchain.pem, it said there was a mismatch between my cert and my key, and so I checked and the cert did indeed match with a newly generated key in the /etc/letsencrypt/live/<my domain>/ folder. My specified key was smaller than 4096, so maybe it just thought "ok i'll make a new one" without telling me? Either it should use my specified key, or it should error and say my key doesn't match my key size spec. Something's going wrong here.
