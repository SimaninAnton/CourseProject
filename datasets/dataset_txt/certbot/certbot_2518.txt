Hi. I used the following command to issue my certificate:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --email (mail-here) --webroot -w /var/www/ --webroot-map (map-here) --csr (DER-CSR-here)
How can I renew that certificate? Because I have seen that renewals are possible when --apache is set, but I don't want LE client to affect my apache configuration at all.
