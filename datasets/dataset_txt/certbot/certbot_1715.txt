Hi,
I am getting SSL error while trying to access https://www.fulspoon.com. I have to click on advanced and proceed to load the site. While installing SSL using certbot, I can see only fulspoon.com in the domains list. Web server: apache.
https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.fulspoon.com
None of the common names in the certificate match the name that was entered (www.fulspoon.com). You may receive an error when accessing this site in a web browser.
The site works fine without www (https://fulspoon.com)
