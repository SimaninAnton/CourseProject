Hello (especially @domcleal , trying out LE and loving it so far.
Here's my apache parsing trouble right now (PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/xy-le-ssl.conf', u'Syntax error')), which hinges on the following line in my apache configuration:
SSLRequire %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN} in {"foo@bar.com", "bar@foo.com"}
If you need the entire config file, let me know. But commenting out this line leads to LE running normally.
