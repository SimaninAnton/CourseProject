In cryptography 2.4 added support for making OCSP queries which I requested at pyca/cryptography#4261 (comment).
We currently shell out to openssl for this. Doing this makes things like Windows support and our new packaging harder because we depend on the openssl command line which must be installed in an OS specific way.
I think we should change this code to only conditionally shell out to openssl when the necessary features in cryptography aren't available. In the future, we can hopefully remove the code that shells out all together, but I think we need it while we are relying on packaging from Linux distros.
