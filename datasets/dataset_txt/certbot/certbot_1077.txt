My operating system is (include version):
Debian 7.10 (Wheezy)
Apache/2.2.22
I installed Certbot with certbot-auto to genrate one certificate for two domains which are on the same serveur. But i got an inexpected redirection from my-domain1.fr to my-domain2.fr ??!! :/
So, after a lot of time i decided to delete certbot files... in order to restart from the beginning...
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I ran: ./certbot-auto
and got: Error while running apache2ctl configtest.
Action 'configtest' failed.
The apache error log may have more information.
syntax error on line 46 of /etc.apache2/sites-enabled/domain-name.backup:
SSLCertificationFile: file '/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain-name.fr/cert.pem' does not exist or is empty
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I probably shouldn't have to delete cerbot-auto files
Thank you for your time guys.
I think it's obvious but i'm a noob with shell and certificates, this was my first attempt.
