Lots of our advice on how to install the client and start using it is platform-specific (what OS are you on? Are there packages? How do you install them? Is there a plugin for your server? Is it in a different package? Etc)
We're going to build a small JavaScript widget to let the user select their platform, so they can get maximally concise and relevant advice for installation and getting started.
