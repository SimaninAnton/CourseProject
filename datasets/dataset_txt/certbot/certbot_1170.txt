My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
It was executed from source git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./letsencrypt-auto renew --agree-tos
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt: 
An unexpected error occurred:
VersionConflict: (acme 0.14.0 (/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('acme==0.12.0'))
Please see the logfile '/tmp/tmp4Z07EI' for more details.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
