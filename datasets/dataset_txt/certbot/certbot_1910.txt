Originally created cert using the webroot method and with defined path x.
web path x has since been updated to path y.
now, on running certbot to renew this cert with the parameters:
/certbot/certbot-auto renew -c /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
cli.ini =
keep
noninteractive
agree-tos
email =
it produces a 404 error:
1 renew failure(s), 0 parse failure(s)
IMPORTANT NOTES:
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain:
Type: unauthorized
Detail: Invalid response from
/.well-known/acme-challenge/YxkZqsf2GvY8fv0GRawD-Hmj2JlOEo-sYaTR_X1ROTQ:
"
<title>404 Not Found</title>
404 Not Found
"
To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
contain(s) the right IP address.
i fixed it by manually editing the file: /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/.conf
and updating the webroot path specified in the parameter: [[webroot_map]]
is this normal? Thanks.
