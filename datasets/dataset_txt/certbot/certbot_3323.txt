Misspelling flag gives very confusing error message relating to the subcommand:
$ letsencrypt --asd qwe auth
usage: 
  letsencrypt [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [domains]

The Let's Encrypt agent can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By
default, it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing
the cert.  
letsencrypt: error: argument SUBCOMMAND: invalid choice: 'qwe' (choose from 'run', 'auth', 'install', 'revoke', 'rollback', 'config_changes', 'plugins')
It should rather say: "--asd flag was not recognized". Optionally it should suggest autocorrections.
