The latest ACME spec doesn't want a keyAuthorization field when POSTing a challenge; now you just POST a signed "{}".
This is enforced by Pebble in -strict mode, and we're planning to make that the default on Feb 15: letsencrypt/pebble#192. After that you'll be able to check out an older tagged version of Pebble to make sure tests don't break.
If there's any concern about breaking with non-public servers that aren't up-to-date with the spec, it would be reasonable to make this a v2-only change if that's not too hard. Boulder should support "{}" for both v1 and v2.
