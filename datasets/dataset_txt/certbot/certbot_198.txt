This has the added benefit of doing additional testing on Python 3.
If we want to do this and have all test farm tests pass, this is at least blocked on #6940, however, I have not tried running all tests with a Fedora 29 AMI and suspect that other tests need to be fixed as well. We'll need to update the initial version of certbot-auto used in test_leauto_upgrades.sh and probably fix test_sdists.sh to work on Python 3.
Fedora AMIs can be found at https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/.
