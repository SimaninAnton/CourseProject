in apache if there is a default-ssl conf around then redirect fail
on apache 2.2 and 2.4 it gives this error:
2016-02-11 20:31:40,023:WARNING:letsencrypt_apache.configurator:Failed redirect for noah2.isnot.org
2016-02-11 20:31:40,023:WARNING:letsencrypt.client:Unable to set enhancement redirect for noah2.isnot.org
Unable to find corresponding HTTP vhost; Unable to create one as intended addresses conflict; Current configuration does not support automated redirection

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to noah@eff.org.
 - We were unable to set up enhancement redirect for your server,
   however, we successfully installed your certificate.
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/noah2.isnot.org/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2016-05-12. To obtain a new version of the certificate in
   the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
   Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
according to @bmw it should work on 2.4 but not 2.2 because of how default:443 is handled, but we don't seem to have code to deal with this
relevant code is configurator.py lin 1050
