Hi, I am using Certbot on my Centos7 for years without issue. I have python 2.7, and have installed certbot only by launching the certbot-auto script.
But this morning, when trying to renew my certificate as usual, I got the following error :
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/letsencrypt: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/letsencrypt", line 7, in <module>
    from certbot.main import main
  File "/opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/certbot/main.py", line 3, in <module>
    from __future__ import print_function
ImportError: No module named __future__
I don't get how, but it seems Certbot may be using the wrong version of python ? I can see the "future" package in /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/future. I can also make the from __future__ import print_function when launching manually the python in /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin, so I am a bit lost :/
I tried to rename the eff.org folder from my /opt to force the redownload, but it is worse, I get the error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main
Which seems also to indicate that there is an issue with the path to python ?
Thanks for your help !
