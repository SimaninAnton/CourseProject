Sometimes Certbot development virtual environments need to be recreated due to a change in our dependencies (which isn't always handled automatically due to pip's lack of dependency resolution) or entrypoints. When this happens, devs can get strange errors from tox or running certbot from their virtual environment that aren't at all clear what the problem is.
We should make a simple cleanup/troubleshooting shell script in tools that moves .tox and the existing venv directory, recreates the venv, and instructs the user to activate the new virtual environment. tools/venv.sh should help with a lot of this.
In addition, we should add documentation in our Developer Guide explaining that this occasionally happens and they can run this script to recreate their developer environment.
