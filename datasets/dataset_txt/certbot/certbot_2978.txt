I'm trying to generate an SSL cert to add to Google App Engine. I'll admit to not having a clue about what I'm doing.
I'm following instructions from here which send me to this console
It's asking for this:
when I run ./letsencrypt-auto certonly and enter wtwf.com for the domain I get back
Failed authorization procedure. wtwf.com (tls-sni-01): connection :: The server could not connect to the client for DV :: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge
from what I gather from letsencrypt/acme-spec#19 it's trying to connect on port 443 to verify the domain (but I doubt that'll work until I have it set up, catch22?)
I also tried ./letsencrypt-auto -d wtwf.com certonly and even added in a -d www.wtwf.com too
running ./letsencrypt-auto certonly and typing www.wtwf.com gets me a Error creating new authz
I'm running all this on an El Capitan Mac I've run ./bootstrap/mac.sh
in /etc/letsencrypt I have lots of .pem files under csr/ and keys/
