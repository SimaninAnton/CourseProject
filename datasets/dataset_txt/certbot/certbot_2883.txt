I found this instructions how to use the service without using the python install scripts:
https://www.tty1.net/blog/2015/using-letsencrypt-in-manual-mode_en.html
Please add a hint in your email how to use the manual mode and also a small summary, what the scripts do.
Otherwise, we will earn a lot of distrust by users, that already know how to create certificates and administrate their servers, that don't like to execute a python script in a box, without knowing EXACTLY what the script does.
We need transparency and a good HowTo how to use the service manually
