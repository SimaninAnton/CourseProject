My operating system is (include version):
Debian stable
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Debian package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
cd docs
make dirhtml

docs/api/account.rst:4: WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module u'certbot.account';
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It doesn't build all the documentation
