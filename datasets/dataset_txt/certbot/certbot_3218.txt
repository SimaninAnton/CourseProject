I've seen this on two systems that were used for pre-release dev work:
pde@damoclid:~/letsencrypt/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto --help
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Running with virtualenv: sudo /home/pde/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --help
An unexpected error occurred.
VersionConflict: (acme 0.0.0.dev20151020 (/home/pde/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('acme==0.0.0.dev20151008'))
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
pde@damoclid:~/letsencrypt/letsencrypt$ cat letsencrypt.log

rm -rf ~/.local/share/letsencrypt didn't fix this. Manually pip upgrading or pip uninstalling letsencrypt-nginx didn't seem to fix this. But doing both of those things together did.
