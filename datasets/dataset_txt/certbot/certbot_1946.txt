I have git clone'd this repo to a production machine, then performed ./letsencrypt-auto --help to determine what the script was going to do... I was not expecting it to start installing packages!
Clearly, the logic is "This script will need these things to perform actions, so let's do it, then check the arguments", but... it's a little bit nerve racking!
