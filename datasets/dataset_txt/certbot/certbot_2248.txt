When I run with --text, I get these lines as output:
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://02e645.le-test.hoffman-

You should test your configuration at:

These lines are artificially wrapped at 80 characters, even though my terminal is much wider than that. This breaks the links and makes them (a) unclickable and (b) hard to paste into a browser.
I think with --text, we shouldn't wrap lines, but leave it to the user's terminal.
