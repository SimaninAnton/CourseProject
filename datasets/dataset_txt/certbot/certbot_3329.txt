When obtain_and_enroll_certificate is called in client.py, it examines the renewal configuration and tells the user if automatic renewal/deployment has been enabled for their certificate. These messages should only be displayed if the renewer is actually configured to run automatically. Otherwise, these messages will confuse the user.
Additionally, renewal status should also be reported if the new certificate is considered a renewal of an existing certificate.
