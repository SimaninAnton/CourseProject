The following errors were reported by the server:

Domain: radio.cloyne.net
Type:   unknownHost
Detail: No IPv4 addresses found for radio.cloyne.net

To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain contain(s) the right IP address.
It is not true that there are not IPv4 addresses for radio.cloyne.net, but it is not a public IP, that is true.
