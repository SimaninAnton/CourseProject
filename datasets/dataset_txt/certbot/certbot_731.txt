If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
$cat /etc/issue.net
Debian GNU/Linux 9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
$sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache -t stretch-backports
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$sudo apt-get upgrade
The following packages have been kept back:
    python-acme

$sudo apt-get upgrade python-acme
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  certbot : Depends: python-certbot (= 0.19.0-1~bpo9+1) but it is not going to be installed
  python-certbot-apache : Depends: python-certbot but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages 
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Upgrade certbot without broken package
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
n/a
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
$cat /etc/apt/sources.list
#Backports - needed for certbot for letsencrypt
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main
