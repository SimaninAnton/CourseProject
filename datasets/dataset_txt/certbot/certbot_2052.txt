Hi,
Following the guide on:
https://certbot.eff.org/#debianjessie-nginx
They say I need to install letsencrypt package:
sudo apt-get install letsencrypt -t jessie-backports
This is not right any-more, and gives a lot of unmet dependency problems. The guide should be updated saying you should install the certbot package instead. Meaning the following DOES WORK:
sudo apt-get install certbot -t jessie-backports
Kind regards,
Melroy van den Berg
