While in some distributions all the configuration files should have .conf - extension, which is the default after #1811 - some distributions use filenames without extension. However for example CentOS has non-configuration files in the same directory as vhost .conf - files, and augeas errors out on them.
We will need to add the option to define files to be parsed per-os basis.
