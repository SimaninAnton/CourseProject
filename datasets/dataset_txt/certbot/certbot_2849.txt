Is it possible now to use the DNS challenge instead of provisioning the .well-known/acme-challenge/... HTTP resource? With my current configuration, the DNS challenge would be much easier than the HTTP method but I can't find documentation of how to do that in the docs for the CLI.
If it's not possible now are there plans to implement this in the future?
