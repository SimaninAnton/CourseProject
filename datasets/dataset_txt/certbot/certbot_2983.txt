Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement letsencrypt (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for letsencrypt"
on Ubuntu 14.04, I have upgraded python to 2.7.9 I am using todays clone of letsencrypt.
I have spend several hours on this. I have tried all the suggested fixes for this problem I could find such as:
pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1
apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
pip install requests[security]
pip install pyOpenSSL
I have compiled and installed the latest pyOpenSSL 0.15.1
Nothing I have tried has changed the error messages.
