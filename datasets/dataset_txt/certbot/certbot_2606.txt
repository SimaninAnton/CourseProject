Provides a method in CLI to check if the existing certificate is due for renewal.
example usage:
$ letsencrypt-auto should_renew
# return 0 if less than 10 days to expiry
# return exit code greater than 0 if no need for renewal
This would allow a slightly more frequent crontab, e.g. weekly cron
0 0/7 * * * letsencrypt-auto should_renew && letsencrypt-auto run
It's function should be similar to should_autorenew in storage.py:
