When I go through the notes for running local copy of client. When I get to the step where I run letsencrypt, I get
(venv)➜  letsencrypt git:(master) ✗ letsencrypt
An unexpected error occurred:
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log'
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
The log file says
Traceback (most recent call last):

I is this log file supposed to be created during the setup and installation? I could not find where this is supposed to happen.
Or am I supposed to set this up myself, and this is just not mentioned in the documentation? If so I can add that.
