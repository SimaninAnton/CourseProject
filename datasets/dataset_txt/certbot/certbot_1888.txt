Hi guys. I've been trying hard to get a perfect score with Nginx + LetsEncrypt SSL cert on the SSL Labs Server Test. I'm getting A+, no problem. Cert is only incompatible with IE6/XP and Java 6 which is more than fine. Those are built on ancient technology and should not be used anymore.
The main thing is: I simply can't get a 100% score at all. I've followed multiple tutorials claiming to be able to provide me with a perfect score, which doesn't happen.
The most I can get out of the test is:
100% - Certificate
95% - Protocol Support
90% - Key Exchange
90% - Cipher Strength
Is it possible to get perfect score with Nginx using Lets Encrypt certs today?
