currently, the code checks rather early for running as uid 0 and terminates letsencrypt if it is not running as root.
this code should be put in a function "require_root" (or so) and calls to that should be put at all places where it is clear that it can't continue without root.
see also #200 - that does not require root (in fact, it doesn't require much at all, except being able to modify DNS somehow).
