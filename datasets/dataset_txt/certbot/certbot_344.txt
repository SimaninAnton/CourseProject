The problem is that the changelog during the release shouldn't have a master section, but I'd like there to always be that section in the master branch so people can always land PRs and update the changelog accordingly, even while we're doing a release.
I think we should just make these changes locally during the release. We'd change the master section to the latest released version, do the release, and then update the changelog to include a new master section. This can then all be pushed up and landed in one PR and should be fairly easy to automate.
I'm not sure how exactly this should be handled for bug fix releases, but I'm sure we can figure something out.
@ohemorange, I did this manually for the most recent release, but we should automate it. Are you interested in working on this?
