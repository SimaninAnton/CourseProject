Based on previous discussions (#3587, #2071, #338), we should have an improved overall strategy for managing certs. This looks something like:
Step 1. list-certs command
Step 2. Specify canonical {archive, live} directories in conf file
Step 3. --use-lineage-name
Step 4. --set-lineage-name
Step 5. --use-lineage-name , "did you mean" based on filenames and such if ambiguous
Discussion items:
A. What should we call the canonical selector that I have temporarily termed "lineage-name"?
B. Where does this canonical name live?
Options for this include:
as a line item in the conf file, whose name does not matter
as the filename of the conf file, and document this choice.
I am personally for the latter, based on @schoen's observation that the file system then ensures uniqueness.
