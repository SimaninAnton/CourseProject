Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Installed certbot from the PPA as per User Guide. Its version is certbot 0.14.2.
I ran this command and it produced this output:

The challenge fails.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
letsencrypt.txt
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
mydomain.txt
According to the letsencrypt.log file it seems that it tries to include the challenge config to the apache2.conf under /files/etc/apache2/ which of course doesn't exist.
