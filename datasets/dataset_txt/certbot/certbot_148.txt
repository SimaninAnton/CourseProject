See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705300.
The relevant code is in certbot/util.py and its tests. The code is currently a fallback if other mechanisms don't work and is being used both for our user-agent string and in the Apache plugin. We could either remove the fallback completely or don't offer it on Python 3.8+. I've only briefly looked at the issue, but I'm personally leaning towards the latter to prevent regressions on current installations.
