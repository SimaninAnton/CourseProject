My operating system is (include version):
Debian 9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache -t stretch-backports
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot --authenticator standalone --installer apache --pre-hook "apachectl -k stop" --post-hook "apachectl -k start"
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The virtual host is unreachable, both http and https. Webserver still works for /var/www/html
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
