My server's DNS zone is secured via DNSSEC and TLSA, so I cannot just create a new certificate and use it. I have to create it, put its fingerprint into the zone, wait for 24h until that new TLSA record propagated, and only then actually make the certificate live.
So far, I haven't figured out a good way to do this with the letsencrypt client.
