Pylint's standards are broken a lot in this file, but this particular case https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/letsencrypt/storage.py#L544 should be easily fixed by calling the function using a dictionary instead of 8 arguments.
We don't have to change a lot of depending code, since the function is only called at client.py, https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/151c674cba6cd1e88521dbb5141d0c25662757b1/letsencrypt/client.py#L272, and the function's own unit testing function, https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/5d9c32b583972e7581cecb5b2b51f0f73d509d6e/letsencrypt/tests/renewer_test.py#L539
