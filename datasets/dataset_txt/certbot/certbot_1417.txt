Apparently, when certbot tries to validate multiple domains in a single pass (e.g. using a custom CSR), if multiple domains share the same root directory, certbot dies with an exception because it has already removed the temporary authorization files from the directory and then tries to remove them a second time and cannot do so.
I've solved this in my copy by changing auth_handler.py:280 from:
        self.auth.cleanup(achalls)
to:
        try :
            self.auth.cleanup(achalls)
        except :
            pass
however, I suspect there's a better way to fix this that would be obvious to somebody who is more familiar with the code.
