Hi,
i had a small problem with the current certbot's behavior. Currently when i generate my certificates certbot put all the key in the same directory. With that a client can know all my subdomains names.
This is problematic when we have development and live testing vhosts. Each vhost is protected, but if I refuse that the search engines referencing them, it's not for see them listed on the certificate
I'm looking for a way to get one certificate/fullchain for each vhost like:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/my.vhost/
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/vhost/
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/another.vhost/
Can you add something like --splitted-certs to do it easily ?
Thank you !
