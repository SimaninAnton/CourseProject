My operating system is (include version):
Any
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
manually
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo pip install python-acme
sudo python setup.py install
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/acme is currently rocking v0.20.0
Installed /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/certbot-0.21.0.dev0-py3.6.egg
Processing dependencies for certbot==0.21.0.dev0
Searching for acme==0.21.0.dev0
Reading https://pypi.python.org/simple/acme/
No local packages or working download links found for acme==0.21.0.dev0
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('acme==0.21.0.dev0')
It's kind of weird that the latest master branch on Github isn't following the dependencies of pypi.python.org, I for one don't mind fiddling around. But the general public might see this as bad practice.
