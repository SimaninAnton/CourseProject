My operating system is (include version):
Docker image 0.17.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Docker image 0.17.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot \
  certonly \
  --standalone \
  --non-interactive \
  --preferred-challenges http-01 \
  --agree-tos \
  --no-eff-email \
  --email admin@trunkinventory.com \
  --domains example.com,admin.example.com \
  --cert-name example \
  --reinstall
running this command will generate the appropriate certs as expected in live/example. However, running this command (with intention to renew) a few days later will not replace the original certificates in live/example but will instead place them in a new directory live/example-001.
I was under the impression that this was addressed in #2071 and #3615 so not sure if this is a regression or bug.
If this is not in fact a bug, how would I achieve overwriting existing certificates of the same lineage when using certonly?
