If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version): Debian 9.6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc): via git and python setup script
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot
$ cd certbot
$ python setup.py install
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
acme is not installed
No local packages or working download links found for acme>=0.29.0.dev0
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available): https://pastebin.com/aKput61t
Theses logs is the console output
