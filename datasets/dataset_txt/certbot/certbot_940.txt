My operating system is (include version):
Debian Stretch 9.1
I installed Certbot with OS package manager:
By following the guidelines from https://certbot.eff.org/
Leading to https://certbot.eff.org/#debianstretch-apache for my OS and it installed version 0.10.2-1
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
version that is included in Stretch doesn't implement the changes from #1042 (for example)
The workaround is to use certbot-auto of course but as said in the docs https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html#about-certbot
Unless you have very specific requirements, we kindly suggest that you use the Certbot packages provided by your package manager
