As long as I know, in order to add a domain to a certificate you need to specify all the "old" domains plus the new one in the -d parameter. This way a mistake is easily made.
A simpler way to add a domain is needed: another parameter, e.g. --add-domain, which permits to add a domain to an existing certificate.
