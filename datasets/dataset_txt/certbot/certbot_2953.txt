I would like to try out letsencrypt on my webhosting reseller plattform (CP11) and some basic knowledge about my server so far:
I don't know what linux it is: uname -a says: Linux 2.6.32-604.30.3.lve1.3.63.el6.x86_64
Via WHM I saw a note that it's a Cloudlinux 6.6, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudLinux_OS
I have access via SSH
There is Python
The setup does not know how to handle this kind of Linux
Where do I start?
I'm reading: https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#prerequisites now :)
And now I ended up at: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/complete-no-sudo-version/4054
DEAD END so far...
I'm trying now with another host which has a Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS for me running. If that works, I will provide the name of the provider and also the service.
