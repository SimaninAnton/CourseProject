As far as I know you validate the domain only by accessing the site via HTTP. As explained in a talk on BlackHat it's theoretically possible to get certificate for a domain you don't control with bad BGP routing.
Can Let's Encrypt somehow mitigate this attack?
I mean as of what I've read on the website the nonce is at first signed, so this is secure as I think.
But what's the verification with a DNS record, which is - according to the site - also offered as a verification possibility? As far as DNSSEC is not used this is not secure.
