There are a few things that might be quite useful to have in our user agent:
Is the user running cerbot-auto or not?
Is this a renewal or not?
What verb did the user pick?
Python version (conceding that #2008 might have been a good idea, because we can't tell which users on old OSes have installed a newer python etc)
