While working on correctly parsing IfDefine configuration directives, my first solution only considers parameters defined by the environment variable APACHE_ARGUMENTS.
This will misses definitions directly passed to the binary via -D.
I attempted playing around with apache2ctl -D DUMP_RUN_CFG, but my initial testing indicated it only presented variables defined during the particular run of apache2ctl. Not the variables defined by the currently running server.
If I do not find a solution, I will have to add additional command-line parameters to Apache.
Any help from those more knowledgeable about the subject would be greatly appreciated.
