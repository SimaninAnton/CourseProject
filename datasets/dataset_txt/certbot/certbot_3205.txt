We should never do raise Exception, always raise Exception()
I just had a report from RHEL user that he couldn't get Apache plugin to work. Turns out that default server root is /etc/httpd. Can we please do raise errors.NoInstallationError("Configs not found at {0}".format(self.conf("server-root"))) so that the explicit error message is found in the logs? Now it's only:
2015-10-23 14:40:49,632:DEBUG:letsencrypt.plugins.disco:No installation (PluginEntryPoint#apache):
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/letsencrypt/plugins/disco.py", line 103, in prepare
  self._initialized.prepare()
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/letsencrypt_apache/configurator.py", line 145, in prepare
  raise errors.NoInstallationError
NoInstallationError
Could you look into that @SwartzCr, please? :)
