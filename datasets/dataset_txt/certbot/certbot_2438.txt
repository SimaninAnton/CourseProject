I'm getting the error below when trying to generate new certificates consistently when using emails for the finergy.com.au domain. It works, if I use a different email domain. I suspect there is something different on this domain configuration that is causing the internal error but I can't tell what's the issue from the error message.
The domain has an A and MX record as per below:
host finergy.com.au
finergy.com.au has address 103.230.157.51
finergy.com.au has IPv6 address 2404:9400:1:0:216:3eff:fef0:18fb
finergy.com.au mail is handled by 1 finergy-com-au.mail.protection.outlook.com
Error message:
2016-02-09 02:10:32,053:DEBUG:root:Received <Response [500]>.

Looks like it's the same or similar error this person is seeing too.
