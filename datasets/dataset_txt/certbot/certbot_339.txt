Where we depend on josepy, I think we should depend on josepy>=1.1.0.
The reason for this is when older versions of josepy are used with cryptography>=2.0, users hit certbot/josepy#13. Really, we'd like logic like "if cryptography>=2.0 is the version being used, depend on josepy>=1.1.0", but I'm not even sure logic like this is possible and if it is, it complicates things significantly.
A small bump to the version requirements in new versions of acme, certbot, etc. for another package of ours shouldn't be a problem at all and avoids this complexity.
