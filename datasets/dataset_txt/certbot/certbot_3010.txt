When running letsencrypt-auto, I get the following message:
The program apache2 (process ID 23326) is already listening on TCP port 80. This will prevent us from binding to that port. Please stop the apache2 program temporarily and then try again.
I do not want this. My web server is important, and taking it down for I-do-not-know-why long isn't an option for me.
I guess this is done for proving the posession of the domain.
Can't this be done on a free port and not port 80?
