I understand that domains containing underscores are a violation of one or more RFC specs, but all major browsers support them, all popular DNS providers support them, and some software needs them for "magic subdomains" that start with a leading underscore.
I'm trying to get a certificate for a domain that's in the format of _something.example.org, which some software needs.
When I try to register this domain, I get an error that says "Requested domain [domain] is not a FQDN"
