If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
freebsd 11.1-RELEASE
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS-package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --webroot -w /usr/local/www/acme -d domain.nl -d www.domain.nl -d hermes.domain.nl -d imap.domain.nl
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain: imap.domain.nl
Type: connection
Detail: Fetching
https://imap.domain.nl.well-known/acme-challenge /tB2rClCTVMGoKcPKIC4kiIA30Bp3oMNYjvL_7PvqEL0:

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Due to missing / (slash) between nl an .well-known the URL is wrong
