I followed the instructions in the email "Let's Encrypt Closed Beta Invite" exactly as given:
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
cd letsencrypt
./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory certonly
Near the end of the process I was given a popup saying "Enter email address (used for urgent notices and lost key recovery)". I entered my email address as used for the beta invite and was then told:
An unexpected error occurred.
Error: malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Error creating new registration :: No MX record for domain yaxom.com
This error is plain wrong. There are 7 MX records for the yaxom.com domain.
Can this be fixed?
