My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Packed manager, certbot 0.19.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew --post-hook "systemctl reload apache2" > /dev/null
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
No output... because all is OK
But Certbot send the Info to stderr:
root@uplink:/home/nas# certbot renew --post-hook "systemctl reload apache2" > /dev/null
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Cert not yet due for renewal
I use cron to renew my certificate.
The "problem" is now: Every day i get a mail from my server regarding an "Error for Certbot"
Sure... i can now redirect also the error output to /dev/null.... but what is if "Certbot" has a real problem.
Also the debug log specified this messages as "Info"
2017-12-01 09:37:47,514:INFO:certbot.renewal:Cert not yet due for renewal
Could you please send the messages for "Cert not yet due for renewal" and "Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log" to stdout?
