When configuring for example.com, the client should by default attempt to authorize itself for both example.com and www.example.com, and issue a certificate containing both.
Similarly, when configuring for www.example.com, the client should also attempt to authorize both domains.
We should only attempt do this if a DNS lookup reveals that both hostnames resolve to the same address.
