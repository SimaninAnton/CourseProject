Hello,
There are users out there that do not have fully HTTPS capable client devices (i.e. a browser that does not support TLS1.0 or Server Name Indication). Especially, default Android 2.x browser and any version of IE on Windows XP do not support SNI. What is more, users of Android 2.x usually do not have any way to upgrade to an SNI-compliant browser apart from getting a new device (as AFAIK Google Chrome requires Android 4.0 and Firefox requires much free RAM).
Some websites may still wish to support such users.
So, when the Let's encrypt client enables full HTTPS redirection, there should be some user-agent sniffing going on so that only recent browsers (those that support required HTTPS features) get full encryption. Google has been doing this since it enabled HTTPS search by default.
