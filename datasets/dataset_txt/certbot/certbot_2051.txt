I made the cert with the following command.
./certbot-auto certonly --webroot /var/www/www.example.com -d www.example.com -d example.com
the DNS are correct. then I just try the renew --dry-run
./certbot-auto renew --dry-run
always I got
2016-05-30 15:05:17,853:WARNING:certbot.renewal:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.example.com.conf produced an unexpected error: Failed authorization procedure. example.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/78q6nKlt-wFcYnxxtr8r-hdZU8OrDIzGwItnQHPPeqE, www.example.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to http://www.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/3yBxHBqoX34VUeaja8MVWoR81iQss_YWg-vwmIbWKlY. Skipping.
the certs was correctly generate with the setup that I have the root of each domain it's accesible by the script to place the /.well-known/acme-challenge/hash file
I've tried with standalone flag and it works
