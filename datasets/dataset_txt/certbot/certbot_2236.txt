My steps are from the getting started guide
 git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
 cd letsencrypt
 ./letsencrypt-auto --help
This installs it locally, so if I try to run
 ./letsencrypt-auto --apache
After selecting the domain for which to install the certif., I'm getting
failed to connect to host for dvsni challenge
By accident I discovered I could run from here, too
/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt
And this worked just fine. What's the difference between the two?
Running
letsencrypt --apache
like the guide says doesn't work because it is not installed globally by default.
Aside from that, for this, made my life a bit easier.
