I'm running Debian Jessie (stable, 8.7), with Certbot version 0.9.3-1~bpo8+2 installed via apt-get from jessie-backports.
I just finished setting up a hook script to handle the DNS-01 challenge to issue certificates, but that feature was added in Certbot v10. Debian Testing has had the updated package since late January, but it hasn't been backported. Can you submit the newer package to the backports repository as well, or is there a technical reason it's missing?
