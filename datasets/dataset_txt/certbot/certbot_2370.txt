The top of the user docs should plainly state that letsencrypt requires domain validation, which is either automatically handled through a server-specific plugin, run through a standalone server, or read through a specially configured webroot. It's not until you're deep in the docs that it becomes clear one must stop or restart their main webserver. That should be up top in a narrative overview.
There should be some way to test the 'webroot' system. This could be a --dry-run flag that writes to the webroot and reads from it's public address to ensure it's set up right for reading and writing, or maybe some manual instructions on how to test/ensure.
