I wonder if we can use certbot for apps that are running on Shiny Server and NodeJS?
Any reliable guide available for configuring these servers? I have these apps in Arch Linux and this is the guide I found https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Let%E2%80%99s_Encrypt
But I am a bit confused as it says:
The webserver must be started and accepting HTTP traffic on port 80.
My apps are on the port 3838 (Shiny app) and 3000 (ExpressJS/ NodeJS app).
