directories
currently it is apache2/certs/ and apache2/ssl/.
better: apache2/certs/ and apache2/keys/.
also, the directory name could be special for letsencrypt, making it e.g. apache2/le-certs and /le-keys.
this might be nice if an admin wants to keep some non-le certs/keys in the directory called certs/keys and not mix it with the le ones.
filenames
currently:
key-letsencrypt_10.pem
key-letsencrypt_11.pem
key-letsencrypt_12.pem
key-letsencrypt_13.pem
key-letsencrypt_14.pem
key-letsencrypt_15.pem
key-letsencrypt_1.pem
key-letsencrypt_2.pem
key-letsencrypt_3.pem
key-letsencrypt_4.pem
key-letsencrypt_5.pem
key-letsencrypt_6.pem
key-letsencrypt_7.pem
key-letsencrypt_8.pem
key-letsencrypt_9.pem
key-letsencrypt.pem
you see: this does not even sort correctly in the directory listing.
so, the minimum fix required is to use this pattern: %04d_key-letsencrypt.pem
do you want to keep these saying-nothing filenames? we could also transform the domainname to a valid filesystem name and use that.
