I think they are and Python 3 will automatically convert \n to the correct line ending on the platform, but we should verify this is also true in the ways os.linesep is being used here and then make the change or close this issue.
If someone wants to take this on, please include an explanation for why the uses of os.linesep are or are not correct.
