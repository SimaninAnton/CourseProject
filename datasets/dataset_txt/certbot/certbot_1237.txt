My operating system is (include version):
AWS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git clone
certbot-auto certonly
We need update certificate automatically from cron, but we cannot stop our production server (Node.js + Express.js), can we configure "webroot" thing with express routing?
