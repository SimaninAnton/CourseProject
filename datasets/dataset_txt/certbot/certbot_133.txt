On my freshly installed instance of Debian 8, wget 1.16 can't verify LE certificates. It might be a good idea to update the guide to include curl or a more recent version of wget.
My operating system is (include version):
Debian 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
As mentioned in this guide:
root@u:~# wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
converted 'https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto' (ANSI_X3.4-1968) -> 'https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto' (UTF-8)

ERROR: The certificate of 'dl.eff.org' is not trusted.
ERROR: The certificate of 'dl.eff.org' hasn't got a known issuer.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The guide is for Debian 8 and it doesn't work with wget 1.16
