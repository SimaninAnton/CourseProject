I've installed letsencrypt without any issues.
Configured nginx to serve content from /.well-known/acme-challenge/ (double-checked - it seems fine).
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /tmp/letsencrypt-auto -d www.metalhail.ru -d metalhail.ru --verbose
/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log: http://pastebin.com/FhEh4W1E
It seems to me like POST to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/new-authz returns 500 code but I'm not sure why.
