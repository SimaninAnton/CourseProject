In auth_handler.py, all code starting with the call to perform on the plugin and ending when the challenges can be cleaned up in the normal case should be wrapped in a with error_handler.ErrorHandler(self._cleanup_challenges): (or an equivalent) block. With the way this currently works, _cleanup_challenges would be called just outside the end of the with statement for the case when an exception/signal doesn't occur, but this could/should probably be refactored to have this handled by the with statement.
