My operating system is (include version):
RHEL6.9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
some local changes
some live debugging (using pdb)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew
...
Attempting to renew cert (a.example.com) from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/a.example.com.conf produced an unexpected error: Attempting to overwrite challenge file - /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. Skipping.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I'm pretty sure it spent a "renewal attempt" instead of recognizing it couldn't go forward and bailing early
It didn't provide any way for me to fix my condition
It didn't usefully explain what went wrong
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
...
Include /etc/httpd/conf.d/le_tls_sni_01_cert_challenge.conf
