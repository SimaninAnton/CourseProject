If I re-run letsencrypt-auto for an existing cert that isn't up for renewal yet, and I specify --keep-until-expiring, letsencrypt terminates with just the donate message:
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /var/www/test.net/ -d test.net -c /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini --keep-until-expiring --server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you like Let's Encrypt, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
Printing a "No changes made; certificate not renewed" would be helpful from a user interaction perspective
