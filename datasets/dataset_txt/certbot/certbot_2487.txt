If we have to do a large number of renewals at once with Apache (or in the future with Nginx or other plugins), we may have multiple reloads associated with each lineage event, even though carefully managing the client's scheduling could reduce this dramatically (for example, make all of the relevant pending changes associated with all authorizations or lineages, and then do a single reload). Right now we could have pretty bad scaling problems when trying to do hundreds of renewals at once!
