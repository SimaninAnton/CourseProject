I tried to use my personal email of tom (at) busby (dot) ninja when prompted for key recovery, but it didn't like it. My gmail.com email address worked fine. I'm wondering if the email validation regex is a little out of date and doesn't like some of the new TLDs.
If I get a moment I'll have a look myself and submit a PR if it turns out I'm right.
