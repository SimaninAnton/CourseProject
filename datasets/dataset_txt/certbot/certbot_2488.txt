When running letsencrypt without root, I get
An unexpected error occurred:
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt'
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
The underlying reason is that, to run without root, I need to specify --config-dir, --work-dir, and --logs-dir. However, the client doesn't give me any suggestion about this or about the possibility of doing anything (even reading help) without root access.
While a sysadmin would probably conclude that the reason for the OSError is simply that the client needs root to run, it would be great to have a clearer and more useful error message in this case.
