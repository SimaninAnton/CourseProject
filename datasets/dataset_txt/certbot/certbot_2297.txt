Hi,
I just noticed my certs had renewed successfully, but the old certs were still showing on the website. This was not a big deal immediately, but after 29 days they would have expired, and that would cause problems.
So, for a fully automated solution, the letsencrypt renew command should reload the webserver config. In my case this was a matter of 'service nginx reload' and the new certs appeared. This command should only be run on a successful renewal. i.e. when the cert has less than 30 days to run.
Perhaps this could be addressed by a line in the relevant /etc/letsencrypt/renew/domain.conf file. Something like
run_on_successful_renewal = 'service nginx reload'
