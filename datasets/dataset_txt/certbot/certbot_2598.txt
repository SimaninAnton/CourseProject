The following line in an Apache config causes letsencrypt-auto --apache to fail with "There has been an error in parsing the file"
RewriteRule ^test" http://example.com/
Apache configtest is OK with it though and I use a similar rule on a real server because some search engine years ago decided one of my URLs ended with an unbalanced "
I suspect this parsing problem is similar to issue #1960 or #1531.
