My operating system is (include version):
Arch Linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --nginx -vv -d domain.net -d blog.domain.net -d cf.domain.net -d mail.domain.net
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It hung for 5 - 10 minutes without printing any output.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.

Other info:
Nginx wasn't running when running Certbot. Nginx version is 1.11.10. We should investigate this issue before unhiding Nginx. If we struggle to reproduce, we can kick/close it.
