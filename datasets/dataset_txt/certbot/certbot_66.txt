Originally from a discussion at community.letsencrypt.org.
Background
I'm running certbot (v0.39.0 latest) in docker. I want to use the --http-01-port flag.
Problem
When I use it in a config file, it works.
But when I use it as a flag, docker logs certbot show me:
usage:
certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] …
Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates. By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate.
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --http-01-port 80
If I convert all the stuff in the config file to equivalent flags, it works.
Notes
WORKS: when there is no config file, and it's used as a flag
WORKS: when there is a config file, and it's used in the config file
FAILS: when there is a config file, and it's used as a flag
