Hey there! Thanks for certbot and providing so many wonderful things for free, it is appreciated!
I am having a simple problem: I don't understand how to specify the "webroot" static file path on my server. For example, my django static folder points to https://mydomain.com/static/, so any webroot authentication files end up at https://mydomain.com/static/.well-known/acme-challenge/yaddayadda
How do I specify the "/static/" path on my domain to look for "/.well-known"? I know this is probably obvious somewhere, but I've read quite a bit and still can't find it. I know someone like me will search for "certbot specify static folder" some day so this may help someone in the future, even if it is obvious :)
