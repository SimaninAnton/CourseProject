This has been a highly requested feature. We would like to allow all servers to receive a trusted certificate even if the project doesn't fully support their system with proper configuration.
This would involve creating a new "NullConfigurator" class (I am not tied to the name, you may call it what you like :) ). This class would essentially only perform challenges for a given domain name and output the certificate, key, and chain file at the end. (in the current working directory)
In order to perform the challenges you will have use a crypto library or spin up a lightweight server to help you perform the challenges. The challenges are at the bottom of the document here - https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec/blob/master/draft-barnes-acme.txt
It would be the admins job to install the certificate, but this would enable all webserver to attain a certificate, no matter what system they are running.
(If you only want to contribute by supporting one of the challenges to begin with.. it would still be a major help.)
