If a user deletes the entire accounts directory, storage.py gives a crash on next run.
Deleting accounts without deleting the associated certs is not a recommended action (effectively it creates a referential integrity problem between the two), but maybe storage.py should be more robust and can give a more specific and useful error. I'll also file a related issue about how to change e-mail addresses, which in this case is what the user was trying to do.
