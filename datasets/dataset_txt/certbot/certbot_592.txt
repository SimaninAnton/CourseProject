Hi,
I use a SSD vps from ovh my domain name is accessible outside I installed all the packages but at the time of generating the certificate I have this certificate yet everything is good on my side
DNS ok A, AAAA ok,
Domain: XXX
Type: connection
Detail: Fetching
http://XXX.fr/.well-known/acme-challenge/OAABm_AdZD6pZjLsXng8OA0H-6bYsiR- AsrZd1SdzUk:
Timeout after connect (your server may be slow or overloaded)
To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
entered correctly and the DNS A/AAAA record(s) for that domain
contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.
