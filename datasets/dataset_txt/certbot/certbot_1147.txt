If you look at the sidebar on https://certbot.eff.org/docs/api.html, you'll see the modules which have documentation available (e.g. certbot.crypto_util). Several of our modules don't appear (e.g. certbot.cert_manager), as they don't have entries in docs/.
There are two main parts to this issue:
Find modules that are missing from docs/ and add them in. See the existing examples to figure out how to do this.
Review the Sphinx-style documentation in the modules you are going to add (or ones that are already included), and add any extra information if you can. Sometimes we didn't have time to include anything beyond a short comment explaining what the function does, but other kinds of documentation can be added (e.g. parameter types, return types, errors raised, etc ... )
See here for more info on how to work with our documentation: https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html#updating-the-documentation
This task would be a great way for a first-time contributor to be introduced to certbot's codebase!
