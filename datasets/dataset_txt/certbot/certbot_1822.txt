I recently updated my certbot package from v0.4.1 to v0.8.1.
I set up a cronjob for renewals before and it worked as expected with v0.4.1.
Now it seems like the renewal configuration file is invalid with v0.8.1 and didn't got modified in the update process.
I get the following error when running letsencrypt renew as cronjob:
WARNING:certbot.renewal:Renewal configuration file /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/domain.conf produced an unexpected error: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'apache_enmod'. Skipping.
Is there a way I can manually patch it? If yes, how? If not, do I have to resetup it completely?
