Currently, if the client receives an unrecognized error type from the server (e.g. rate limited), it gives an unfriendly error:
An unexpected error occurred.
ClientError: (<Response [429]>, DeserializationError("Could not decode 'typ' (u'urn:acme:error:rateLimited'): Deserialization error: Error type not recognized",))
Instead, the client should expect that error types will be added that it does not recognize, and report them to the user similarly to other errors, including the error detail message.
I think this is fairly high priority to fix, because otherwise it prohibits Boulder from using meaningful error types.
