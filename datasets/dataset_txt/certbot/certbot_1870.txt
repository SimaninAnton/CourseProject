Currently, the add method of the HelpfulArgumentParser includes the following phrase about the parameter topic: can be None for "always documented". Despite this, flags with a topic of None are ONLY documented in --help all output. If the behavior is incorrect, it should be fixed. If the comment is incorrect, it should be updated to reflect the actual behavior of the client.
