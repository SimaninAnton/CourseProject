My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
sudo pip install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ certbot register --non-interactive --quiet --agree-tos --register-unsafely-without-email
Registering without email!
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
From certbot --help all:
  -q, --quiet           Silence all output except errors. Useful for
                        automation via cron. Implies --non-interactive.
                        (default: False)
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
