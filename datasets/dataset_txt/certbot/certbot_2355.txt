In a Travis job run at 2016-02-29T03:47:20Z, I got a failure with this message:
Attempting to renew cert from /tmp/leitrssL/conf/renewal/le.wtf.conf produced an unexpected error: day is out of range for month. Skipping.
I suspect that there is an error in the day-parsing code that doesn't understand leap days (Feb 29). Note that this will make all our integration test runs fail for most of the day tomorrow.
