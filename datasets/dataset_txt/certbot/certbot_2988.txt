Attempting a stand-alone install on AWS Linux 2015.03 generates this error:
Command "/home/ec2-user/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2.7 -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-xMWPFC/cffi/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r \n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-BRUl0h-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /home/ec2user/.local/share/letsencrypt/include/site/python2.7/cffi" failed with error code 1 in/tmp/pip-build-xMWPFC/cffi
I suspect its because I am missing something on this instanance, though I did make sure to
alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2.7
as the default is 2.6 and letsencrypt-auto said support for Python 2.6 is "experimental."
I also looked for logs that might tell me what was missing, but didn't find anything.
Any ideas are appreciated.
