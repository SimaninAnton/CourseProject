We should be able to find out if the location that the challenge configuration file is written isn't parsed by apache by inspecting the Apache include paths from augeas tree.
If the challenge location isn't parsed by apache, print out meaningful error message to the user (suggesting to use --apache-challenge-location /path/parsed/by/apache).
