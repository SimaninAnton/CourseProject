This, over and over:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    if self.shouldRollover(record):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/handlers.py", line 154, in shouldRollover
    self.stream = self._open()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py", line 943, in _open
    stream = open(self.baseFilename, self.mode)
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/tmpPLCIf1/logs/letsencrypt.log'
Logged from file util.py, line 147
We should probably fix that.
