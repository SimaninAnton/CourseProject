As far as I can tell, the letsencrypt client does not bind to ipv6 in standalone mode nor do the commands given in manual mode. While this may not seem too significant, but for people with ipv6 only machines (like me) this is quite a big problem. My suggestion would be to somehow bind to both ipv4 and ipv6 at the same time.
Either way, what you're doing is a great service to the global internet community, keep on rocking!
