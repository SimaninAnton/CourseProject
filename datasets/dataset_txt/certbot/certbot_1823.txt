When I run ./certbot-auto, after it says Installing Python packages, after a while it gives me a very long error which ends with You are using pip version 8.0.3, however version 8.1.2 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
I tried the command that the error suggests and pip is already up-to-date. Then searching on Google I found that I had to upgrade the pip command inside the folder .local/share/letsencrypt/ but the folder letsencrypt inside the share folder doesn't exist.
So, what the heck should I do??
Sorry for bad English
