The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Incorrect validation certificate for TLS-SNI-01 challenge. Requested 53e284899cd48a822380048681b90521.6ee8cb35eaf00278ae373218f6207c97.acme.invalid from 5.152.178.140:443. Received certificate containing 'intranet.scp.co.za, www.intranet.scp.co.za' - I get this error when i run certbot-auto, i have implemented same functionality on the 4 other servers but with this server there is an conflict with an existing ssl cert from GoDaddy, is there any reason why this will not allow me too generate a cert? I am using webroot to specify path for the command - Thanks in advance
