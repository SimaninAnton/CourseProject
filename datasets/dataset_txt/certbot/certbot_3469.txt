The Let's Encrypt agent can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By

  auth                 Authenticate & obtain cert, but do not install it
  install              Install a previously obtained cert in a server
  revoke               Revoke a previously obtained certificate
  rollback             Rollback server configuration changes made during install
  config-changes       Show changes made to server config during installation

Choice of server for authentication/installation:

  --apache          Use the Apache plugin for authentication & installation
  --nginx           Use the Nginx plugin for authentication & installation
  --standalone      Run a standalone HTTPS server (for authentication only)
  OR:
  --authenticator standalone --installer nginx
