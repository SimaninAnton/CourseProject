Certbot 0.37.1 was released last week reverting the change we made to disable TLS session tickets in Apache as it caused TLS errors on some systems. More details about the failures can be found at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/ssl-error-after-cert-renew/99430 and our public Mattermost channel.
I think we should investigate the cause of these errors. As of right now, no one on the Certbot team has been able to reproduce them. The reasons I think this are important are:
Ideally it would be nice to fix the problem and land a PR again to fix #6901.
None of our tests caught the problem before the release. It'd be nice to know more details about what went wrong so we can try and prevent similar issues in the future.
