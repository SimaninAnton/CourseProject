My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu, 16.04.
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Apt Package Manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ sudo certbot --apache2
(... 30 seconds later)
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --apache2
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It took nearly half a minute to error out.
