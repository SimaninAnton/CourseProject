Steps to reproduce:
In /etc/apache/sites-available/SITE, have the line:
ServerAlias *.example.com
Run letsencrypt.
Actual result:
At the "Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?" menu, *.example.com is listed. However, if you select it, you get the error:
Error: unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Error creating new authz :: Syntax error
Expected result:
Wildcard names should not be listed. Possibly the app should acknowledge that they exist but make them unselectable, with help text explaining that LE doesn't support wildcards.
