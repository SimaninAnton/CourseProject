Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/adnanber.be.conf produced an unexpected error: Failed authorization procedure. www.adnanber.be (http-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Invalid response from http://www.adnanber.be/.well-known/acme-challenge/[REDACTED]: "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC>

All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/adnanber.be/fullchain.pem (failure)
1 renew failure(s), 0 parse failure(s)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: www.adnanber.be
   Type:   unauthorized
   Detail: Invalid response from
   http://www.adnanber.be/.well-known/acme-challenge/[REDACTED]:
   "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC>
   <html>
   <head>
   <meta http-equiv="content-type"
   content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
   <title>Adnan Ber."

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
Is what I'm getting when trying to renew. I have googled for similar problems but all the fixes I found did not help at all. I would be forever thankful if I could get some help with this, as I have NEVER had this issue before, and I've used LetsEncrypt for about a year now.
Cheers.
Edit: Might be a DNS issue. I'll report in a while/tomorrow and see what I've even been doing.
Edit: Doesn't seem like it is an issue with DNS. certbot notes an "unauthorized" error trying to reach the .well-known/acme-challenge directory, but I've set the proper authorization levels (I assume 755 is sufficient?), however it gets the 404-page as an error (I set a tracker in both my 403.html and 404.html to see which page it reaches), yet I have set the 403 error page in my nginx config file as 403.html and the same for 404.
