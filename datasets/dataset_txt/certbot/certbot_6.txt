Hello,
are any plans for update repo on ubuntu?
I am using certbot installed from certbot repository (certbot/certbot) and last version installed on my Ubuntu 18.04 is 0.31.0-1. I updated acme servers of old certificates and try --dry-run option, but fails - returned
*.conf produced an unexpected error: urn:ietf:params:acme:error:malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Method not allowed. Skipping."
I found it is caused by old certbot, but I have last from repo...
Thanks.
