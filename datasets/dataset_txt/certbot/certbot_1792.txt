In a setup with a reverse proxy sending the challenges to the standalone webserver, the challenges can fail because the reverse proxy may require a few seconds to resolve the standalone webserver and start redirecting traffic to it. As a result, this sometimes causes the challenges to fail.
Adding a (configurable) wait between starting the standalone webserver and running the challenges would solve this issue.
