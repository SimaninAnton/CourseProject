Reading over the documentation it appears that the hooks only occur after renew is ran.
Our setup uses certonly and --renew-by-default, however when generating a certificate we have a script that must be ran, to standardise the location of the certificate and concatenate the fullchain and privkey together.
Is there a hook that gets the domain names etc like --renew-hook does, but is always called, on renew, create etc.
