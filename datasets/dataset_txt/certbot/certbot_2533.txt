I get stuck in an infinite loop where it asks me the question about if I'm ok with my IP being logged, to which i say yes. Then I set up the proper .well-known/acme-challenge file as it requests. It says Press ENTER, which I do, and then the "are you ok with being logged" comes up again, and it generates a new acme challenge. Repeat, ad infinitum. What's going on??
