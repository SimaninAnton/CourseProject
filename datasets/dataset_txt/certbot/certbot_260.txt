On Ubuntu 16.04, I experienced some behavior from our Apache plugin which surprised me.
If you request a certificate for a domain that is not found in your Apache config, the plugin modifies all HTTP vhosts to perform the challenge. I can't remember Apache's vhost precedence rules about this off the top of my head, but isn't there a default vhost we can modify?
We'd need to check the behavior on both Apache 2.2 and 2.4 before making any changes here.
I observed this behavior both with and without the changes in #6729.
I think we've had this behavior for a while so it isn't a high priority problem, but I think it's excessive and could slow things down a lot on systems with many virtual hosts.
