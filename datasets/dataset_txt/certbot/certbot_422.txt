My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot-auto certonly ... > "/path/to/my/file.logs"
and file contains only:
...

Installation succeeded.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I get error that "too many certificates already issued for exact set of domains: ...". I want see this part of command line logs in my "/path/to/my/file.logs" too. Is it possible to do?
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
Why I need this?
I have built Docker image with certbot-auto and cron tools inside. Cron is checking if certificate was generated >= 80 days ago and generate it if >= than 80 days. I know about cert lifetime 90 days, just want to have 10 days to generate it manually if something went wrong. Let's imagine this "something went wrong" happens. I want see full logs in "/path/to/my/file.logs" file.
