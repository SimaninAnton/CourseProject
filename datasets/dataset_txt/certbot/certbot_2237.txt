When I run with -v, I see entries like this repeatedly:
2016-04-07 05:23:55,283:INFO:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org
2016-04-07 05:23:58,509:INFO:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org
This probably means that the connectionpool is not actually reusing connections properly, which makes the process slower than it should be.
