About the NOTICE "The best way to get started is to use our interactive guide" at docs/intro.html.
Suggestion: up it to the first paragraph! or add a lateral box (example an IMAGEM WITH THE NOTICE in red).
The Guide is so complex. All "guide readers" today use ^F to find needs after read first paragraph... And, as a "so impotant notice", need the alert in the first paragraph.
The interative guide is so important to reduce dissatisfations with certbot itself and with the Guide itself, and to reduce support demand and to reduce (expurious) communication in the forum.
