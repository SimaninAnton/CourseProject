My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
manually certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
all command lines parameters are ignored, Apache-Config files no more correctly parsed - only 1 domain offered as a choice
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
