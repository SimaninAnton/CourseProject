I began work on porting the client to obsd, with an eye toward integration with the openbsd httpd, but ran into an issue in the venv setup step.
Collecting psutil>=2.1.0 (from letsencrypt==0.1.0.dev0)
  Downloading psutil-3.2.2.tar.gz (253kB)

psutil does not support OpenBSD. There is an issue open with psutil about this (giampaolo/psutil#562) but work on it seems to have stalled about 6 months ago.
There are only 2 calls to the psutil module in the client:
$ grep -r psutil *
letsencrypt/plugins/util.py:import psutil
letsencrypt/plugins/util.py:        net_connections = psutil.net_connections()
letsencrypt/plugins/util.py:    except psutil.AccessDenied as error:
letsencrypt/plugins/util.py:            name = psutil.Process(pid).name()
letsencrypt/plugins/util.py:    except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied):
Though I certainly understand wanting to use a pre-rolled mechanism for interface discovery.
I'd love to help in any way possible with this. Thanks for all the work already done!
