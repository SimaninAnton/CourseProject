We should clean up https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#other-methods-of-installation.
In particular, we currently list instructions for OS packages in two places which makes it harder for them to stay up to date/in sync (especially since they are in two different repos). Additionally, I think some of this information should be changed. For example, we say
Unless you have a very specific requirements, we kindly suggest that you use the certbot-auto method.
I think this is incorrect. In almost all cases, OS packages should be preferred over certbot-auto.
