Today @jsha made an argument that we should work a bit harder to make the script plugin feel and operate consistently with the existing hooks. We reached some conclusions about this:
--script-auth and --script-cleanup could become --auth-hook and --cleanup-hook; that would require moving them out of a plugin but that's doable.
Support from them could be moved from their own plugin to the manual plugin, with the advantage that existing manual users could told about them interactively and onboarded into the brave new scripting future
We disagreed on whether --auth-hook should always be run or whether it should be specific to --manual, but concluded that this would be the prerogative of whoever implements this refactor.
