My operating system is (include version):
Debian GNU/Linux 9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew --dry-run
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Attempting to renew cert (api.xxxx.net) from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/api.xxxx.net.conf produced an unexpected error: Failed authorization procedure. api.xxxx.net (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Fetching http://api.xxxx.net/.well-known/acme-challenge/jSoShtk_jR6dBI0GVczowzNheFXmc9jA0ESbQ3MNV1g: Timeout. Skipping.
All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/api.xxxx.net/fullchain.pem (failure)
If i run this certbot renew --dry-run the temp file "/.well-known/acme-challenge/jSoShtk_jR6dBI0GVczowzNheFXmc9jA0ESbQ3MNV1g" was created and i can access this file via Browser "http://api.xxxx.net/.well-known/acme-challenge/jSoShtk_jR6dBI0GVczowzNheFXmc9jA0ESbQ3MNV1g" so it must be a certbot bug.
