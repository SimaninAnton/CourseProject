In order to make strategic decisions about plugin prioritisation (engineering prioritisation, whether to ship or not ship each plugin in letsencrypt-auto, and which ones to prefer in the UI), we need to know which ones are succeeding for people.
That means we should send a small amount of plugin and platform information by default in the client's User Agent string, so that we can compute aggregate success rates on the server side. Probably it should be which plugins are in use (Authenticator: Standalone; Installer: None) and platform major version (Debian 8). We should have a flag to disable it, for people who prefer not to reveal anything at all about their server software.
