Well, sort of. The ErrorHandler class adds its own signal handlers to those listed in _SIGNALS at the top of the file. Some of these signals seem to be ignored by default on some systems (such as SIGXFSZ on Ubuntu 16.04). Regardless of them being ignored, we still install our own signal handlers that cause the program to exit/run error handling code. When setting signal handlers, we should only modify those that aren't being ignored by checking if signal.getsignal returns signal.SIG_IGN.
