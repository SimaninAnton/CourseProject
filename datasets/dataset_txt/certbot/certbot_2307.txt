The docs currently live on letsencrypt.readthedocs.org - they should move to either {new name}.readthedocs.org or to {new name}.readthedocs.eff.org or something.
This will require making the new website, moving over the docs, and having the old docs either redirect to the new page, or somehow be kept up to date with them
