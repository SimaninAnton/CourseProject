Hello all
First post so go easy on me.
I am on a Mac Os Yosemite (10.10.5)
Python version 2.7.11
Just running the usual install command:
$ git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
$ cd letsencrypt
$ ./letsencrypt-auto --help --debug
When it gets to the "Installing Python", here is the output
Installing Python packages...
Had a problem while downloading and verifying Python packages:
Downloading argparse==1.4.0 (23K)...
Downloading cffi==1.4.2 (207K)...
Downloading https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/C/ConfigArgParse/ConfigArgParse-0.10.0.tar.gz#md5=408ad7af06cd449420cecc19bee6f0c9 (from https://pypi.python.org/simple/configargparse/) failed: <urlopen error [Errno 60] Operation timed out>
If I take that url and just drop it in the browser, works fine. Not sure why command line is dying on that one.
Has anyone else experience this for Mac OS?
Again, this is my first post. If I missed something or need to add something, please let me know in a constructive manner.
Thanks.
