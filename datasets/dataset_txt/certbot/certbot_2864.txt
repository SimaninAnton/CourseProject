You can also tell it exactly what you want it to do from the command line. For instance, if you want to obtain a cert for thing.com, www.thing.com, and otherthing.net, using the Apache plugin to both obtain and install the certs, you could do this:
thing.com resolves to a real website - although otherthing.net does not.
I'll be submitting a PR to change these to example.com and example.net as per https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved
