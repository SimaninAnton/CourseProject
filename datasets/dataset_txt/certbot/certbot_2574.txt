Since #1081 is still a thing, I copied my configuration (from ~2 months ago) from the server to local machine and am trying to renew the certificate.
Running
sudo letsencrypt --work-dir ~/Desktop/letsencrypt/ certonly --standalone --config-dir ~/Desktop/letsencrypt/
will allow one to enter domains at which point it outputs
An unexpected error occurred:
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
and quits. Logs are empty.
