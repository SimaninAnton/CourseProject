I was looking at issues on the nginxparser project and found this one:
fatiherikli/nginxparser#19
It appears to me that we can't parse configurations containing this. I got something like
ParseException: Expected stringEnd (at char 100), (line:5, col:1)
when trying to nginxparser.loads() a file that included that map directive.
