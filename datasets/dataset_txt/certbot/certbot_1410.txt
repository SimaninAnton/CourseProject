Previously I had successfully obtained certificate for one of my sites. Now I have to add certs to another three sites (they all are virtual hosts sharing single IP with first site, but each of them have it's own DNS records). But I get error:
Failed authorization procedure. mynewsite.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Incorrect validation certificate for TLS-SNI-01 challenge. Requested f544c91aa78c8e3185d89b0647f460cc.8e9c2579c00173d8f366c31d3ca1d230.acme.invalid from 78.47.232.162:443. Received 2 certificate(s), first certificate had names "myfirstsite.com",
For each of three sites with their's names at start and one "first site" names at end (where "first certificate had names" is).
What should I do? (Ubuntu 14.04, Apache)
