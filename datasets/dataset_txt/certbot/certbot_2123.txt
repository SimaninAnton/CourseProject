As we know ./letsencrypt-auto will create a hash file at for example;
http://www.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/xxx
My SSL install fails because the xxx file is owned by root and Apache is unable to deliver the file. This results in a 404 error and the authentication fails.
Does anyone know how I can give the file correct user/group permissions? I can't see any option for this in the --help output.
