Hi,
I've got a question: Is it possible to add http2 support to nginx? It should just be a matter of replacing listen 443 ssl with listen 443 ssl http2 and it works if nginx is compiled with HTTP2 support:
$ nginx -V
nginx version: nginx/1.10.3
built with OpenSSL 1.1.0f  25 May 2017
TLS SNI support enabled
configure arguments: ... --with-http_v2_module ...
This could be detected or made configurable with an additional flag maybe. Any thoughts on this? Can I manually configure this somehow in the meantime?
