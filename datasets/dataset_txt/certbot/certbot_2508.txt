Background
Suppose a certificate was created using a command of the form
letsencrypt-auto run -d www.example.com -d example.com ....
Note the order in which the domain names appear.
Observed behavior
The renewal email mentions the relevant domain names in some wacky order:
example.com, www.example.com
Desired behavior
It should mention them in the correct order ... at least with the correct name first. This is important, because the certificate files are named after the first domain name mentioned on the command line, as discussed in item #1376.
The email should be even more explicit: It should say like:
To renew the same set of domain names, pass the following options on the command line:
-d www.example.com -d example.com
