I'm using this python script for a while to renew certs and update TLSA records in DNS:

But now certbot errors out: No handlers could be found for logger "certbot.crypto_util" which "triggers" my error handling. The certificates are signed, that's not the problem. But my script sees an error from letsencrypt and stops processing. I could disable the check, but that's a bad idea.
How to fix this? Missing package maybe?
