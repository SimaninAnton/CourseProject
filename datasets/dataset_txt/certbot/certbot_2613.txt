Hi, I am on OS X Server Client 10.9.5 Mavericks and I went to the process of installing LetsEncrypt. Now I am going to the process of configuring the certificates. I already started a threat on the LetsEncrypt Communities under the title;
Installing LetsEncrypt on a Mac OS X Client Server (Sorry, the post title has been edited)
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/installing-letsencrypt-on-a-mac-os-x-client-server-questions/7839/13
My problem is that I ran into permissions issues and I need to find out what is the right permissions for the directory LetsEncrypt installed on /etc/letsencrypt? .. or if there are different permissions for the sub-directories,
a. accounts
b. archive
c. csr
d. keys
e. live
f. renewal
I have tested the server and so far I could not make Apache 2.4 work. Any suggestions? Thanks!
Thanks!

Ps: I did read other posts but they have some many different answers that I got confused as "what are the correct permissions". This should not be a charade in the development.
