The following section can be found on the packaging wiki.
The following scripts are used in the process:
https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/tools/dev-release.sh
https://gist.github.com/kuba/b9a3a2ca3bd35b8368ef
The first link is simply broken and the second one links to a script which brings no real gain to a package maintainer IMHO. The paragraph should probably be rewritten and merely refer to release.sh, which was really helpful while assembling a proper package.
EDIT: I did not edit the section myself because I might be completely wrong about this. I did not write letsencrypt-code and therefore want to be very cautious about altering the documentation.
