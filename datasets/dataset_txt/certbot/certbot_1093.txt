Part of the reason for #4087 was Nginx config snippets like this:
if ($host != 'example.org') {
    rewrite  ^/(.*)$  http://example.org/$1  permanent;
} 
This allows Nginx to redirect users to the canonical name for the site.
In this case, creating an HTTP->HTTPS redirect is still possible but the Nginx plugin refuses to do it because it sees the rewrite directive.
It'd be nice to automatically configure the redirect configurations like this someday.
