My operating system is (include version):
Fedora 25
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
package manager
certbot version: 0.12.0
Context and expected behavior:
I have a certbot installation with two different accounts (A and B), and each account has one certificate.
When a certificate is about to expire, an email should be sent to the account owning the certificate.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
When the certificate of account A is about to expire, an email is sent to the address of account A, which is good.
However, when the certificate of account B is about to expire, an email is also sent to the address of account A, and not of account B, which is not good.
