I used the letsencrypt-auto client with --webroot --webroot-path.
When the webroot path does not contain a .well-known folder yet, the client creates it as root (current user) with permissions 700. With a webserver running as www-data this will not allow the webserver to serve the challenge files, as it does not have the folder traversal (x) permission.
The subfolder acme-challenge is created with www-data:www-data 777, which is fine.
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot --webroot-path /path/to -d example.com
