With #2537, we correctly detect wildcard ServerAlias directives when choosing a vhost, however, we still add a specific ServerName/ServerAlias even though it's not necessary.
For example if we have:
ServerAlias *.example.com
After we install the certifiicate we'll have:
ServerAlias *.example.com
ServerAlias www.example.com
We shouldn't do this as the change is unnecessary and (slightly) complicates the resulting vhost.
