Can Anyone help me where should I get debian packages to install cerbot on ubuntu 13.10?. When I am trying to install cerbot using ./certbot-auto it results following error:
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libtinfo5 : Breaks: dialog (< 1.2-20130523) but 1.1-20080819-1 is to be installed
 logrotate : Depends: cron or
                      anacron but it is not going to be installed or
                      cron-daemon
 python-dev : Depends: python (= 2.6.5-0ubuntu1.1) but 2.7.5-5ubuntu1 is to be installed
              Depends: python2.6-dev (>= 2.6.5) but it is not going to be installed
 python-virtualenv : Depends: python-support (>= 0.90.0) but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: python-setuptools (>= 0.6.10) but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: python-pip but it is not going to be installed
 python2.7 : Breaks: python-virtualenv (< 1.7.1.2-2~) but 1.4.5-1ubuntu1 is to be installed
E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
So, I am trying to find out packages to install certbot.
