See #6603 (comment). Since we should still work with cryptography 2.4, I think we should check for the existence of a signature_hash_algorithm attribute, if it exists use that, and otherwise continue to use _SIG_OIDS_TO_HASH.
Alternatively, we can only use cryptography to check OCSP with cryptography>=2.5, but the check in the code will have to be changed.
