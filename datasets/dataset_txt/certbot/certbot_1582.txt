The Nginx plugin was modeled very closely after the Apache plugin. Recently our linter started complaining about duplicated code and we fixed it with a hack (see #3881). We should actually fix this.
How best to do this depends a lot on what's actually duplicated and I haven't looked into it closely. One potential option is to make a class that installers can derive from to help them with reverter usage. This may help future plugin authors as well.
