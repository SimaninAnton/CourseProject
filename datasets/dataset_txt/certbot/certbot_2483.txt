letsencrypt.reporter.Reporter.add_message has a on_crash parameter that is supposed determine whether the registered message should be shown if the program exits with an unhandled exception.
Due to the way we suppress all exceptions, this does not work properly and needs to be fixed.
Marking this as low priority since there is currently only one place in the code where we add a message with on_crash=False and it is the last thing done before the program exits.
