My operating system is (include version):
Gentoo profile 13.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
emerge app-crypt/certbot-9999 (= latest git master commit)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
server ~ # certbot -vv --version
usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert. 
certbot: error: must-staple is a flag but is being set to 'False'
server ~ # 
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Partially related: #4490 (it "broke" my certbot by having a faulty cli.ini variable).
I would expect functions like --version to be able to run without a problem, even when some parts of the program would result in an error.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
There's no log generated. The above is all certbot is outputting, even with -vv.
