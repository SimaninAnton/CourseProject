letsencrypt certonly modifies the paths passed as --cert-path and / or --fullchain-path before saving the certificates. This means the resulting paths are unpredictable (without knowledge of letsencrypt internals, that is). Quite bad for automation.
In case there are no existing files at the given paths, letsencrypt certonly should simply use the paths as-is. The default action in case there are existing files is up for debate, but there should be way to tell letsencrypt certonly to overwrite the existing files ("batch mode") if that's not the default.
