It seems like there's an ever-growing number of important things that the user ought to be told about (contractual obligations; locations of key material; existing backups of key material; need to protect and back up key material; existence of auto-renewal; how to revoke a cert).
We need to think through which things the user needs to be told about, under what circumstances, and how they'll be phrased, and perhaps also do some experiments to see whether the information is clear and memorable to the user (and also whether it causes annoyance or makes the cert deployment process appear to take longer than it reasonably should).
