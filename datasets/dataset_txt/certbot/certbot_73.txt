When I look into /etc/letsencrypt/archive (ls -l), all pem files, including privkeyX.pem have mode "-rw-r--r--".
Live folder sym-links to archive folder, which means that current keys are also readable by non-privileged users.
I'd expect all files to be "-rw-------". I'd expect certbot to enforce strict permissions, like ssh does.
Are such loose permissions required for operation? What chmod command should be used on /etc/letsencrypt/archive to tighten this up?
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 18.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt
