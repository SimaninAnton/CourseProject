If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
The ppa has v0.21, but only v0.22 (released 7 days ago) can do wildcards.
