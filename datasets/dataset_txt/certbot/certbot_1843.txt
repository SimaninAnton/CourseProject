Hi im seeing the following parse error when trying to add a cert.
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/usr/local/apache/modsec/10_asl_rules.conf', u'Syntax error'),
Ive attached the file.
10_asl_rules.conf.txt
