My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto --nginx
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Upgrading certbot-auto 0.36.0 to 0.39.0...
Couldn't download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/v0.39.0/letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto.
