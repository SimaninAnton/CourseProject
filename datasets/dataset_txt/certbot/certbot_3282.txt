proof_of_possession.py currently relies only on the installer to determine the location of potential private keys that could be used to complete the challenge. While the installer should continue to be used, the code should also check the key_dir of the main configuration. This is where the client stores all private keys it creates when generating a CSR.
This will require a little refactoring, but continuity_auth.py has access to the configuration and should simply forward it along to proof_of_possession.py
