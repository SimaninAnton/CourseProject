mock testing library is listed in dependencies for some reason:
certbot/certbot-nginx/setup.py
Line 14 in fda6553
 'mock', 
There is a test_require list:
certbot/certbot-nginx/setup.py
Line 78 in fda6553
 tests_require=["pytest"], 
Shouldn't mock be moved there as well?
I didn't check all modules, but it looks like mock is included in most of them as well as primary dependency
