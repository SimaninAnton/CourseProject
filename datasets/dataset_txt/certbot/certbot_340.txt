This change hasn't been included in a release yet so no users are seeing failures, however, it's causing our some of our nightly tests to fail for older OSes which can be seen at https://travis-ci.org/certbot/certbot/builds/454634684?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification.
@adferrand, are you able to take a look at this?
