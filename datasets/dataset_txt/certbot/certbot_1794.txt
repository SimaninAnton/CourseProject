It might be useful to allow the script to detect if scl enable httpd24 /bin/bash is applied when searching for DocRoot. As it stands, the script doesn't allow for installation when the default apache package is httpd24-httpd, rather than httpd on RHEL7/CentOS7. It looks for vhosts in /etc/httpd/conf.d/* for ServerName and/or ServerAlias. However, when httpd24-httpd from SoftwareCollections is used, those are specified in /opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d.
