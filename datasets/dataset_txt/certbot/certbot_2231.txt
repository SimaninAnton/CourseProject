A more general form of #2768, I think the acme module should ignore unknown fields instead of raising an error. Erroring out at unexpected fields provides little benefit, violates the robustness principle, and causes problems like #2768 while the ACME protocol is under development.
@kuba, if you have any thoughts on this, I'd love to hear them.
