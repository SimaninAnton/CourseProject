When I use the command ./letsencrypt-auto --apache I receive the following message:
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(u'Error Parsing variable: ${INSTANCE_ADDRESS}',)
Looks like the plugin is not being able to parse the env_var in the address field. Here's the conf file with the env_var:
`<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerAdmin <*removed*>
ServerName <*removed*>
ServerAlias ${INSTANCE_ADDRESS}

ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/author.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

RequestHeader unset Authorization
