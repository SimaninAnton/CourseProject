I'm on a shared hosting plan, and I can't seem to generate an SSL cert. I'm guessing it's because port 443 is already open and uses a certificate for *.asoshared.com. I get this error:
Failed authorization procedure. mydomain.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Correct zName not found for TLS SNI challenge. Found '*.asoshared.com, asoshared.com'
And I can't run letsencrypt on the shared host, I don't have sufficient permissions to do that. I don't see why the current certificate matters, I just need to generate my own and then upload it via cPanel.
