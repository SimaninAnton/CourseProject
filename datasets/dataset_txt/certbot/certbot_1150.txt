My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
from the ppa
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew --nginx
the nginx config has the line server_name *.*;
But certbot returns Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/qqq.example.com produced an unexpected error: Cannot find a VirtualHost matching domain qqq.example.com.. Skipping.
When it should find that that's a valid config.
as @ohemorange pointed out it works with server_name ~.*;
