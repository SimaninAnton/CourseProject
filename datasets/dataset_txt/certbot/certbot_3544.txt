This is a reminder to myself, to submit a PR based on kuba/letsencrypt@cli...kuba:test-mode, once #376 is pulled in. It allows --server localhost:4000 for local Boulder testing (no SSL), and --test-mode that disables certificate validation (@jsha mentioned Boulder would switch to serving HTTPS out of the box).
