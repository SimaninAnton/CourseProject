Seems like the short help isn't descriptive enough to point the user to the right direction when using multiple domain names, as seen here #1383 .
Also the plural form of the long name is a bit deceptive, as it actually takes only one domain as an argument.
Touches also the subject of #1376 , any suggestions for the actual help text are appreciated.
