I just installed certbot on a Debian box running my Wordpress blog. I have not yet moved to https because I want to ensure that my cert will be auto-renewed seamlessly without downtime. I looked over the docs and see that I can use certbot renew to renew my certificates and have a cronjob to take care of it.
I don't know what the interval should be. Since the certificate is not renewed if its still valid, my job could run hours before expiration and not be renewed and then run 24 hours later, causing a downtime of say 20 hours (if it last ran 4 hours before expiration and I run it every 24 hours).
How often should the cronjob be run? Running it every hour seems redundant given 6 month validity. Also, since certbot knows the expiration timestamp, can a deamon (say certbotd) run in the background and take care of renewal upon expiration without setting up a cronjob?
