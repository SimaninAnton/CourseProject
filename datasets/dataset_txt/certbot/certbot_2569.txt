Hi all;
I'm having some troubles executing letsencrypt. Used this tutorial: https://eblog.damia.net/2015/12/03/lets-encrypt-automation-on-debian/
System: Bunsenlabs / Debian "Jessie"
Maybe someone had the same "issue".
Terminal:
$ ./letsencrypt-auto --apache
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: sudo /home/xx/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache
An unexpected error occurred:
ExecutableNotFound
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
letsencrypt.log:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Any help is very much welcome.
Thanks.
