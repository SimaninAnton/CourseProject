Please consider installing the certificates to /var/lib/letsencrypt/{live,archive,...}. They are automatically generated and thus don't count as configuration files (IMHO).
Using /var/lib/letsencrypt instead of /etc also allows running the letsencrypt client without write permissions to /etc, for example when mounting /etc read-only or when using systemd with its ProtectSystem=full option.
See also the File Hierarchy Standard which defines /etc as "static", that is "files that do not change without system administrator intervention".
