My operating system is (include version):
ubuntu 14
Linux dev-bj03.7hu.cn 4.4.0-71-generic #92-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 24 12:59:01 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --dry-run --standalone --email lonelyglone@126.com -d git.7hu.cn
output:

Failed authorization procedure. git.7hu.cn (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: DNS problem: SERVFAIL looking up A for git.7hu.cn
IMPORTANT NOTES:
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain: git.7hu.cn
Type: connection
Detail: DNS problem: SERVFAIL looking up A for git.7hu.cn
To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
entered correctly and the DNS A/AAAA record(s) for that domain
contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
can't generate new ca
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
someone say than it should because DNSSEC,this is my DNSSEC INFO, DNSSEC status is off.
