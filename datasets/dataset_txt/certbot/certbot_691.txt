The route53 plugin used to be able to send several update requests, and wait on them all in parallel. It looks like we lost that ability in #4771, possibly due to a bad rebase. We should bring back that capability. Waiting for the server to declare that it's finished propagating is very slow, and so parallelizing that waiting speeds things up a lot.
