When setting up the automation to renew certificates (in case you are using the "manual" modes like certonly or with CSRs). Some steps might need to be repeated several times until everything works as expected. It would be nice if the client supported such a testing mode, by e.g. issuing only self-signed certificates, so that you do not actually request real certificates and easily end up in the rate limit and waste resources of the CA.
