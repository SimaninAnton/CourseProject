If we drop support for a version of Python previously supported by fetch.py, existing certbot-auto installations can fail. If we're unable to reboostrap because we don't have the user's permission, when certbot-auto is run again during phase 1 it will call DeterminePythonVersion and if we can't find an appropriate Python, we exit with an error. Instead, we should print a message about being unable to check for upgrades.
