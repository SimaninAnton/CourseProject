Currently to run the boulder <-> client integration tests you need to add a 127.0.0.1 le.wtf entry to your hosts file. It would make life a lot easier if a flag could be used to either set the DNS server to use, so we can use Boulders dns-test-srv, or a flag that specifies test mode and always queries localhost instead of the actual domain for the challenge verification code.
