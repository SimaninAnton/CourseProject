First time user, so it could definitely be my fault, but I read the docs briefly and ran
 root@host:$ ./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d wzy.ca --email address@gmail.com --agree-tos
Which gave me back:
    Checking for new version...
    Requesting root privileges to run letsencrypt...
       /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache -d wzy.ca --email address@gmail.com --agree-tos
    An unexpected error occurred:
    The provided email for a registration was invalid :: DNS problem: query timed out looking up MX for gmail.com
This is on Debian 8.3 Jessie running on a Seattle based VPS.
If I'm doing something wrong or need to provide more info, please let me know!
