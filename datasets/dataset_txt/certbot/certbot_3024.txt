When the mimetype of the .well-known/acme-challenge file is not text/plain, the client fails.
I noticed that, because nginx seems to treat the file as binary/octet-stream by default.
Mimetype should not matter for the challenge authentication, so the client (or server?) should just ignore the Content-Type field of the response.
