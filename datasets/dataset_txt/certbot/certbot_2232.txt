Suppose the following sequence of events:
You run letsencrypt-auto to completion.
You run apt-get upgrade -y. Further suppose an upgrade for a package like OpenSSL was available.
You run letsencrypt-auto.
The version of OpenSSL we complied python-cryptography against has changed. Couldn't this break your venv until it is recreated? If so, perhaps we should do something to prevent this situation.
