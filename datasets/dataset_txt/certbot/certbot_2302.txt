Running letsencrypt renew with a value for configurator set on the CLI or in a configfile leads to errors like this:
2016-03-15 13:12:28,832:WARNING:letsencrypt.cli:An error occured while parsing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/example.com.conf. The error was Too many flags setting configurators/installers/authenticators 'apache' -> ''. Skipping the file.
This problem is also causing the errors in #2663, where letsencrypt-nginx/tests/boulder-integration.sh is calling letsencrypt with --configurator nginx which causes _set_by_cli to raise an exception when creating a new lineage.
