My setup:
A service (which'll be using certbot to generate the certificates) is running on 3 nodes.
Q. How do I make sure all three nodes use the same account? (I see there is a key in /etc/letsencrypt/accounts.)
Once the certificate is generated, I move it to S3 bucket and delete it from the node (security reasons) where it was generated.
The way I've thought of doing this is copying the /etc/lentsencrypt/archive/.
Q. Is there any harm in doing this? Any suggestions on how to achieve this alternatively?
As mentioned, I'll be deleting the files from all 3 folders (live, archive, renewal).
Q. Will certbot be able to figure out the certificates generated from The Account (essentially same account) and renew all certificates which need to be?
Q. Similarly, for revocation, the account used will be the same as used for generation. So, will I be able to revoke a certificate by just downloading the cert.pem from S3?
