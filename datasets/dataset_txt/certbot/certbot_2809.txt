It seems that the email checking is a bit wonky.
My email is something like "me@blah.hk" which is a perfectly valid email and .hk is a valid TLC however, it is rejected and it tells me the only way to register is unsafely without email (obviously not what I want).
If I use an email from work which has "me@blah.com.hk" it is perfectly happy.
Seems like the email is valid checking has issues. Really I think it shouldn't do any kind of validation on email address except something that has an @ symbol and a dot. If I mistype it, or else if I write it incorrectly it's my own fault.
