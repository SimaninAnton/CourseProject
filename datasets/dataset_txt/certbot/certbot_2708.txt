It's miserable that we'll need to do this, but over in #1811 we identified that le_util.get_os_info(), which relies on Python's platform module, isn't actually recognising operating systems very well. @joohoi suggested doing it based on the letsencrypt-auto fingerprinting model. We could also do it based on what we see in /etc/apache2/ itself.
