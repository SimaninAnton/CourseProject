uses Let's Encrypt's staging server. I believe it is only used to register an account. I think we can remove this reliance by setting up a simple /etc/letsencrypt directory before running Certbot with a staging account. The way I'd do this is by creating a real staging account and deactivating it. The file that would need to be modified is https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-apache/certbot_apache/tests/apache-conf-files/apache-conf-test.
