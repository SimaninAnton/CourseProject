I see this line in renewal.conf:
func = <function obtain_cert at 0x30c9500>
I just want to make sure that's leftover debugging junk and not something used by the client.
I'm working on a node.js letsencrypt client and I'm trying to make sure that my config file is as exactly compatible with the python as possible.
Obviously that's not portable and there's nothing I can do about it, but as long as the python client doesn't actually use it there's not a problem. Otherwise I'd like to file a bug on it and see if it can be represented in some other way.
