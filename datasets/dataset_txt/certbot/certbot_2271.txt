So this technically isn't a bug, but I think the behavior is very confusing.
When using --apache or --nginx, as stated in the help, both the authenticator and installer are set. The problem with this occurs during renewal.
Suppose you ran the client with both --apache and certonly. In this example, due to this bug, both authenticator and installer are set in the renewal config file. When a user runs letsencrypt renew and obtains his new certificate, the following message will be output:
new certificate deployed with reload of apache server; fullchain is /etc/letsencrypt/live/pickupapp.me/fullchain.pem
Is this the behavior we want?
