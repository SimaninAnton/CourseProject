Hello certbot-krew!
Because constants.py is evaluated at build time in order to generate documentation, the pkg_resources.resource_filename path is evaluated to include the build path. At run time, the correct value is used from where it is installed to, but the build path being captured inside the documentation makes the package not binary reproducible. (https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/unstable/amd64/python-certbot.html)
That seems like the only constant that's being dynamically generated like that; would it be possible to exclude it from the documentation?
Thanks!
