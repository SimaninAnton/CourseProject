Now that we've broken lockstep, we need a way to specify that Certbot or a plugin relies on unreleased changes in acme or Certbot.
Suppose the latest released version is 0.24.0 and a package relies on unreleased changes in acme. To do this, we've been using version requirements like acme>0.24.0. This is because acme 0.25.0.dev0 satisfies this requirement and assuming we don't release 0.24.1 (in which case we'd have to change the requirement to acme>0.24.1), the only packages that satisfy this are acme>=0.25.0.
This is unconventional though, has caused confusion with multiple package maintainers, and could cause issues in the extremely unlikely event we release a bug fix release for 0.24 after 0.25.0 comes out.
@erikrose, do you have any thoughts on this? Is this something you think is worth changing and any suggestions on how to do it?
