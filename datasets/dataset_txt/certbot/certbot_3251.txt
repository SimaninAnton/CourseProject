Initially, letshelp-letsencrypt was created to allow users to submit their Apache configuration for testing with letsencrypt-compatibility-test. It would be nice if the scope of this was expanded to include the user's letsencrypt configuration and logs as well. This would greatly simplify debugging problems that occur for different users.
A couple of things to consider:
As I did with letshelp-letsencrypt, great care must be taken not to submit any confidential information. This is partially addressed by #525, but other sensitive items must be considered like crypto keys. We should err on the side of excluding information that might be safe than the other way around.
If this functionality is added, perhaps it's worth considering making this another verb for letsencrypt. Something along the lines of letsencrypt bugreport would make it unbelievably easy for users to report any bugs they encounter. On the other hand, some users may not want this functionality installed on their machine, so perhaps it should be kept as a standalone script. There are pros and cons to both approaches, but I think this design decision should be considered.
