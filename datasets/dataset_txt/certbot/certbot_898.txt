My operating system is (include version):
Fedora 27
4.13.13-300.fc27.x86_64
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
via dnf
certbot-0.19.0-1.fc27
python3-certbot-0.19.0-1.fc27
python3-certbot-nginx-0.19.0-1.fc27
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --nginx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
the original file in conf.d contains
listen 80; as well as
listen [::]:80;
The output of certbot though is only:
listen 443 ssl; instead of also
listen [::]:443 ssl;
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
