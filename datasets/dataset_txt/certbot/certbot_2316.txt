When we move the repo from LE/LE it's likely that certain things that rely on the github.com url will get broken, we need to make sure this doesn't happen.
Presumably this will involve re-directs or editing things like the LE Auto script. This needs to be decided and could get tricky if sub-directories change names (i.e. things besides just the repo name change)
