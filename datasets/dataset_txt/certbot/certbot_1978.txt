After installing certbot using pip install certbot
Running certbot --help returns:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "certbot\main.py", line 12, in <module>
    import zope.component
ImportError: No module named component
pip list confirms that zope.component is installed and I have located zope.component-4.2.2-py2.7.egg in my lib/site-packages/folder, next to the certbot folder
Also tried running python setup.py install inside a clone of this repo and that didn't help.
