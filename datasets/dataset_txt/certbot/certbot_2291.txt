when running /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache
First I have to deselect all, one by one, then i need to find the domain, and its alias, of the vhost i want to make a cert for.
Current behaviour:
When I press ok, a cert is created, using the vhosts ServerAlias as main domain, and the ServerName as additional domain.
