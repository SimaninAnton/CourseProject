Turns out this is a bit tricky. yum install epel-release only works on CentOS systems. On Red Hat systems, we have to wget a package and install it directly through rpm. Testing this for RHN users will likely be a pain as it appears we have'd have to sign up for a Red Hat subscription. Additionally, the EPEL package you download is different depending on your version of RHEL.
