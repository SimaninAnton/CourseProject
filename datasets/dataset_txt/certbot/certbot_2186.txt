The attached log resulted from running ./letsencrypt-auto, selecting only one domain, namely www.tamatzner.de, from the offered list of domains. The error, as discussed in https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/name-does-not-end-in-a-public-suffix-on-eu-and-de-domain/14270, probably resulted from an attempt to certify another domain, namely horde.webmail. This domain wasn't even offered in the list of selectable domains.
Anyway, when running ./letsencrypt-auto -d www.tamatzner.de, the error disappeared, so the both don't appear to be exactly equivalent.
I'd be ready to share my Apache configuration. But this is a Plesk-managed server that has quite a lot of auto-generated config files. Also, by fiddling around with SSL options, they probably got modified since the time the error occurred.
