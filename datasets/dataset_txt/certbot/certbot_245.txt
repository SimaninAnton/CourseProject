I received an email from Let's Encrypt telling me I need to update my ACME client to use an alternative validation method (HTTP-01, DNS-01 or TLS-ALPN-01). Currently using TLS-SNI-01.. I was following the guide below and received an error while running the final command in the tutorial:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-stop-using-tls-sni-01-with-certbot/83210
My operating system is (include version): ubuntu 16.04.3
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc): nginx
I ran this command: sudo certbot renew --dry-run
It produced this output:
"Client with the currently selected authenticator does not support any combinatio n of challenges that will satisfy the CA. Attempting to renew cert (-------------) from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/--------------.conf produced an unexpected error: Client with
the currently selected authenticator does not support any combination of challenges
that will satisfy the CA.. Skipping."
