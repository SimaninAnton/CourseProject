Per pyca/pyopenssl#291, the cryptography package probably covers all the things we need from pyOpenSSL, meaning we could in theory drop the depedency. One particular stumbling block: the acme library has public interfaces that take OpenSSL, in particular CertificateRequest, CertificateResource, Revocation, request_issuance, poll_and_request_issuance, fetch_chain, and revoke.
We should probably take a major semver change to turn these all into giving/receiving PEM, so the acme library can be agnostic of whether people are using pyOpenSSL, cryptography, or something else.
