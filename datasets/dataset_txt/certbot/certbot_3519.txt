Since #396 landed we have a Proof of Possession implementation. It uses the Installer's get_all_certs_keys() implementation to find candidate keys that can be used to prove control of a domain. But not all such keys will be in the places expected by the running plugin; certs and keys may be in the directories that belong to other server software, or in other parts of the filesystem altogether.
We should have another function that is OS- or distribution-specific that uses sensible methods to search asynchronously for keys. For instance on unix it should run locate if that's avaialble and then maybe find /etc and then if all else fails find /.
