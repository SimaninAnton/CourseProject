file_get_contents(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed
Here is some relevant code
  $result = file_get_contents($url, false, stream_context_create(['http' => ['timeout' => (float) $this->options['timeout']]]));
Basically im trying to connect to socket.io implementation and its rejecting it because of of the SSL 3 check...which im pretty sure we dont want anyways
