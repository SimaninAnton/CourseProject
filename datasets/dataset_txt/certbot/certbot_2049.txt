dpkg: error processing package supervisor (--configure):

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
I attempted to re-run certbot-auto and it stopped at the same spot.
I then manually stopped supervisor:
$ sudo service supervisor status
 is running

$ sudo service supervisor stop
Stopping supervisor: supervisord.
And ran certbot-auto again:
$ ./certbot-auto
