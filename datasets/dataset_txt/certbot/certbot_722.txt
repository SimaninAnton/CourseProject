My operating system is (include version):
#1 SMP Debian 4.9.65-3+deb9u2
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS Package Manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --version, certbot revoke
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Traceback (most recent call last):
