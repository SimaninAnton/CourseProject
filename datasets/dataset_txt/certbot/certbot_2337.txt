Hi,
I'm running letsencrypt on osx 10.11. Yesterday, it was working flowlessly. I did not update anything since.
But this morning, when I try to get a certificate for a personal domain, it fails with
Failed building wheel for cryptography.
First, it warns about using pip version 7.0.1, however version 8.0.3 is available while my pip version is 8.0.3.
Then I have the following error
Failed building wheel for cryptography
Command "/Users/radar/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-DUfJSa-build/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-SC_OjG-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /Users/radar/.local/share/letsencrypt/include/site/python2.7/cryptography" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-DUfJSa-build
Note that I have no .local/share/letsencrypt/ folder in my home directory.
Actually, it fails when building wheels for collected packages: cryptography with the following error
build/temp.macosx-10.11-intel-2.7/_openssl.c:423:10: fatal error: 'openssl/aes.h' file not found
  #include <openssl/aes.h>
           ^
  1 error generated.
  error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1
Note that I tried to install cryptography outside a virtuelenv and I did not encounter any issue.
Any idea how I can fix that? And any explanation why it worked yesterday and not today?
Thanks in advance.
