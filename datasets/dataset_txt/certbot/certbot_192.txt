Just wanted to leave a note saying that using the dns-linode plugin, my zone identifier started with a capital letter, which caused the whole thing to choke with the "Unable to determine zone identifier" error message. When I went to linode console and changed the zone name to a lowercase letter, it worked correctly. Capitalizing the commands didn't make a difference. Had to do it from the linode dns manager side.
