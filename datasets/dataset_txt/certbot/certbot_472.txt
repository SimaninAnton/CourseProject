Hey @certbot
I wanted to give you guys a heads up that AnalogJ/lexicon will have a new top level dependency once the Google Cloud DNS provider is merged in AnalogJ/lexicon#261
Basically the idea is to add cryptography as a top level dependency so that developers implementing providers that utilize OAuth will have a library available to do most of the heavy lifting for them.
I know lexicon dependency changes have broken your build/CI process in the past, so I wanted to give you guys a heads up and see how you guys wanted me to proceed doing the merge & release.
Also, if you guys have any feedback about the Google Cloud DNS provider, you can comment here: AnalogJ/lexicon#261
