After installing my new cert, I tested with several browsers. Chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu were happy. Safari and Chrome on OSX were happy. Chrome on iOS was happy.
But Firefox on OSX, Safari on iOS and all three Android browsers (the native client, Chrome and Firefox) all complained about the cert.
Is this to be expected, or have I done something wrong?
