I just had to get a new certificate. i had a, b, c, d and needed to add e, f.
I knew I needed a new certificate, but I could not figure out how to cancel or keep the first certificate from rewing.
I could not figure out how to add names to a certificate.
the docstring on letsencrypt-auto was not very helpful. the faqs weren't either.
I eventually found a recommendation to use --expand on a forum post. it was exactly what was needed.
I don't think the command needs to change, but the docs and faq should make this a lot more apparent. I was very close to doing a revoke+create
