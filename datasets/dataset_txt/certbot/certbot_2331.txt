When I try to run ./letsencrypt-auto --help I constantly get this issue, I had several others before but now this one. (The prior ones were related to CentOS 7.2 and the location of ffi header files, I had to create a symbolic link from ln -s /usr/include/ into /usr/include/python2.7/ for these errors)
This used to all work fine but it seems somewhere while doing a renew this was updated and now no longer works. Help would be greatly appreciated.
CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)
