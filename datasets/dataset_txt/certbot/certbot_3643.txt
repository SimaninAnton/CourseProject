tw@tux:~/w/lets-encrypt-preview$ host myname.nsupdate.info
myname.nsupdate.info has IPv6 address 2002:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxff:fexx:xxxx (only v6 in DNS!)
tw@tux:~/w/lets-encrypt-preview$ host letsencrypt-demo.org
letsencrypt-demo.org has address 54.183.196.250 (only v4 in DNS!)
note: myname.nsupdate.info has v4 and v6 connectivity.
So, not sure what's going wrong, but I think it would be good if you added a AAAA record for the ACME server (and also v6 connectivity in case it is not yet there).
Same thing worked if I put an A record into DNS.
