The method os.path.realpath is broken on some Python versions. See https://bugs.python.org/issue9949.
Even if the situation is covered by certbot.compat.filesytem for its internal usage, it would be beneficial in the long term to have a proper realpath function exposed by this module to ensure a consistent behavior across platforms and python versions.
See #6964 (comment) for the relevant discussion.
