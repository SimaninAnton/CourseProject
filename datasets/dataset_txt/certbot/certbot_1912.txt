Right now you get this prompt for redirect
Please choose whether HTTPS access is required or optional.

1: Easy - Allow both HTTP and HTTPS access to these sites
2: Secure - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access

One confusing thing: The title asks "required or optional," but those words don't appear in either option.
Also, we should provide more advice on how to choose. I.e.
1: Easy - Allow both HTTP and HTTPS access to these sites. Choose this if you haven't yet tested that your sites function properly when visited on HTTPS.
2: Secure - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this change by editing your web server's configuration.
