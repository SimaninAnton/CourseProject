On OS X 10.10.5, when installing letsencrypt as part of running the boulder's integration tests (RUN="integration" ./test.sh), I get the following error stemming from letsencrypt/tests/boulder-integration.sh:
+ sed -i '4arenew_before_expiry = 10 years' /var/folders/.../conf/renewal/le.wtf.conf
sed: 1: "/var/folders/18/96y990v ...": invalid command code f
I'm pretty unfamiliar with sed and everything I've found suggests that the command should look differently on OS X, though I'm unsure how. Any insights?
