_Major steps_:
Finish Apache Configurator (test extremely thoroughly) - This is next on my personal list.
Read configuration with knowledge of loaded modules and other more complex logic.
Review policies regarding vhost selection especially those based on default vhost.
Rewrite redirect, implement HSTS (includes more advanced logic because it really messes with mixed-content in modern browsers), OCSP stapling, SPDY?
Finish Nginx Configurator
This will probably also require finishing the integration testing framework, incorporating the Validator branch, and finding a way to get a large sample of configurations.
Renewal - create renewal cron job
This probably takes an installer (get_all_certs_keys())
Testing - Integrate with other OSs/Testing under different different versions
_Minor steps_:
Implement RecoveryContact
Integrate DNSAuthenticator - I think I see the proper way to move forward on this one...
_Would be nice_:
PoP challenge (might change)
SimpleHTTPs (at least the document placement, don't worry about the self-signed certificate yet)
_Major future steps_
Write Installers for Postfix, Exim, other web servers...
I am surely missing something here so feel free to suggest or add things as needed. My number one goal is to make sure all of the features work. If you would like to be assigned to any given task. Just make a comment or open a separate issue about it.
