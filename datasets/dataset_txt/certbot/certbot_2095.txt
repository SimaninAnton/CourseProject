I can auto-renew certs without any downtime by using webroot, but the only way for Nginx and Apache to actually use the new certs is to restart/reload the webserver. There should be a way to deploy renewed certs without any downtime.
I currently use @monthly service nginx reload in my root crontab so nginx automatically restarts once a month to use new certs, but this introduces a couple seconds of downtime.
