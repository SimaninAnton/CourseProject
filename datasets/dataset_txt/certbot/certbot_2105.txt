i have several sites I've requested certs for in the past but no longer host. ./certbot-auto renew still tries these no longer needed certs, understandably. --dry-run reports failures on these attempts since I originally used webroot and my web server no longer responds to those sites plus i've largely deleted the dns records.
with that all being said, how can i stop the certbot client from trying the sites i no longer need?
