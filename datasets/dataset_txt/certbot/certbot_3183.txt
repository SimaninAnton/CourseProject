Before installing pkg_config on my Arch Linux system, the program failed with the following error:
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.....  Failed building wheel for cryptography
    Failed building wheel for cffi
Command "/home/was3/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2 -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-VhSt8G/cffi/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-Ecfzaq-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /home/was3/.local/share/letsencrypt/include/site/python2.7/cffi" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-VhSt8G/cffi
The program pkg_config should therefore be included as a dependency on Arch Linux.
