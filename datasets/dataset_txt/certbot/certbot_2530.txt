If I run ./letsencrypt-auto like so, it seems like the script chokes at very end, like so:
admin@:~/letsencrypt â‡’ ./letsencrypt-auto
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: sudo /home/admin/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt
Traceback (most recent call last):

This error doesn't appear if I run sudo ./letsencrypt-auto.
