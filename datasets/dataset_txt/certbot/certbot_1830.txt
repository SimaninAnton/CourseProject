Currently certbot v0.8.1 does not revoke the previous certificate upon renewal with certbot renew. I have checked the source code a little bit and also verified this by testing using the actual client. I believe this behavior has not been implemented because it can cause problems with certain automation setups, however, I think it should be implemented and initially be available using a flag, and then, maybe, at some point, be the default.
Some comments on the proposal above:
From a security perspective, it makes sense to have the old certificate revoked, since it would not be used any more and there's no reason to have it as valid.
Most (if not all) browsers do not check for revocation information (Can you visit this?) therefore this might not make any difference currently.
Since most people currently use certbot renew, the amount of revoked certificates will increase, placing further load in any CRLs / OCSP Servers that may be used by the CA. Currently the percentage of revoked certificates is 0.4% for Let's Encrypt.
If someone fails to reload their web server after the renewal, they will theoretically serve revoked certificates until they do.
This is not a high priority issue, it is actually a feature request, and very few people will use this initially, however I am posting this issue so we can track the progress of this.
