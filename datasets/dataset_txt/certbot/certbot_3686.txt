Prominent, expensive certificate authorities go through a fairly elaborate offline background check to verify that a company who purchases their certificates 1. actually exists, 2. is the entity who requested the certificate, and 3. owns the appropriate domain. I guess your certificates are DV (Domain Validated) and what I'm talking about is OV (Organization Validated):

Improperly issued certificates have been used to spoof legitimate sites, and, in some case, install malicious software or spy on unsuspecting users. Several examples are mentioned in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph here:

How do you prevent this kind of misuse? Or are you planning to coordinate your release with the roll-out of Certificate Transparency (previous link)? Are you relying on DNS to establish identity? I've never heard anyone say that DNS was designed to be secure, but maybe it's better than I think. Maybe if you used enough unrelated DNS servers, accessed through unrelated networks, compared them with a huge local DNS cache, and only issued certificates when all DNS sources have agreed for some length of time...
There is no iron clad security. But a false sense of security is no good either. I don't know what, if any code changes are called for to answer these questions, but I would appreciate if you pointed me to any public documentation about how these concerns are mitigated.
P.S.
It looks like your certificates are all currently registered with the University of Michigan:

What's in place to protect U of M from being liable if misuse happens?
Not sure if this is the right place to post this... I just signed up for your mailing list, but I didn't see any messages there yet.
