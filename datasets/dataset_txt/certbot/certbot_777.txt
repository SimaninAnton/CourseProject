We need to file requests for packages for:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudflare (MIT license)
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dns-lexicon (MIT license)
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tldextract (BSD license)
I tried to do this with reportbug, but I don't think it worked as I never received an email with a link to the bug despite providing my email on the command line. We should verify this didn't work, and if so, do it again and send the links to the bugs to Harlan.
The hope here is these packages will be built and maintained by https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PythonModulesTeam.
