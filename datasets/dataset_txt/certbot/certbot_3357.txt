Steps to reproduce:
letsencrypt --server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
Result:
letsencrypt: error: unrecognized arguments: --server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
Expected result:
Same as default letsencrypt command, authorize names and set up a cert, but with a non-default server URL.
