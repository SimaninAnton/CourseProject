My operating system is (include version):
Xubuntu 17.10
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git + certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot-auto revoke -n --cert-path /path --key-path /path --reason cessationofoperation
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
There is no option to operate non-interactively AND not delete the certificates. I was able to achieve this prior to https://github.com/certbot/issues/4914 and just got around to updating my scripting to discover this appears to no longer be possible.
This is a request for a flag to NOT delete certs when revoking non-interactively. The reason I need this is so the certificates can still be used to check OCSP and verify that they were successfully revoked, all via non-interactive automation.
