My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot 0.14.2
I ran this command:
sudo certbot renew --allow-subset-of-names
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I ran the command above a week ago and I'm still receiving (two) "Let's Encrypt certificate expiration notice ..." e-mails.
Both sudo certbot certificates and the information in the browser show the certificates are renewed.
