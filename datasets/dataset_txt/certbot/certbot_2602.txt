When I execute on Centos the letsencrypt auto I get a strange error:
Transaction Check Error:
package libffi-3.0.9-1.el5.rf.x86_64 (which is newer than libffi-3.0.5-1.el5.i386) is already installed
So having a newer package of libffi prevent me from using letsencrypt?
Is it a bug or is it the intended behaviour?
