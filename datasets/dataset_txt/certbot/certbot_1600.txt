On Mac OS X I ran
$ letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto certonly --manual --debug
which produced a bunch of output ending in:
Creating virtual environment...
Installing Python packages...
/bin/sh: /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/elharo/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/pip: "/Volumes/Macintosh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
Traceback (most recent call last):
Looking at the output, it seems likely that the problem is some script is confused because the very common (on Macs) volume name "Macintosh HD" in my path contains a space. Probably some path needs to be double quoted somewhere in a shell or Python script.
I believe this is 0.7.0
