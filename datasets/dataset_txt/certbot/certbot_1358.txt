My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
yum
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --non-interactive --agree-tos --standalone --email='admin@example.com' --key-path=/etc/letsencrypt/live/admin/key.pem --cert-path=/etc/letsencrypt/live/admin/cert.pem --chain-path=/etc/letsencrypt/live/admin/chain.pem --fullchain-path=/etc/letsencrypt/live/admin/fullchain.pem -d my.example.tld
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The certificates were not placed on the expected folders; they were placed y my.example.tld folder, instead of the admin folder, as I would have expected.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
/etc/letsencrypt/live/my.example.tld/fullchain.pem. Your cert
will expire on 2017-06-03. To obtain a new or tweaked version of
this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again. To
non-interactively renew all of your certificates, run "certbot
renew"
If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
e-mails sent to admin@example.com.
Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
