Hi dear Let's Encrypt,
Will you support installing certificates for many websites on one single server? For example, a certificate for www.example.com, another one for another.site.com, and a third certificate for even-more.websites.org? On one single IP address.
And renewing and revoking certs for individual websites? (For example, revoking for only www.example.com but for no other site)
If you will support wildcard certs, will the above work in combination with a wildcard cert for say *.wildcard-example.org?
Best regards, KajMagnus
(P.S. I did get the impression that you will indeed support many sites on the same server, since the command line looks like: lets-encrypt example.com)
