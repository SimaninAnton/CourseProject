As pointed out by @TheBoegl, our instructions for submitting a PR are misleading. Step 5 says:
Run tox to run the entire test suite including coverage. Fix any errors.
Currently, running tox runs the following tests: py{26,27,33,34,35},py{26,27}-oldest,cover,lint.
Many of these tests such as tests for 5 python versions as well of the *-oldest tests which require an older version OpenSSL are not likely to run successfully on a user's system.
We should either:
Update envlist in tox.ini so that only a subset of the current tests are run. In most cases, I think cover, lint, and maybe a py3x test would be sufficient. We should, however, continue running all of our tests in Travis.
Update the developer instructions to explain that ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: for the py* tests or compilation failures for the *-oldest tests do not indicate a problem with your PR and you can continue with submitting your PR.
