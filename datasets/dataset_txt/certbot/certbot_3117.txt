Hi,
it seems that AcceptPathInfo Off (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo) is currently set in the default apache config of Let's encrypt:
https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/74b2e3bc515b5f7e805883a26f1b0e47ed686098/letsencrypt-apache/letsencrypt_apache/options-ssl-apache.conf#L13
This might break web applications like ownCloud which are using routes like seen here: owncloud/core#20202
Please consider to remove this config option to avoid having such issues with applications like ownCloud.
