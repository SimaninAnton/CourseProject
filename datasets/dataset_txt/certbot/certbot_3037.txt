Hypothetical language
A suggestion, possibly mostly correct:
If the -d option is mentioned more than once on the command line, a single certificate will be created to cover all the domains that were mentioned. In particular:
The first-mentioned domain will be the Subject CN of the certificate.
All the domains (including the first) will be version-3 Subject Alternative Names on the certificate.
The certificate will be stored with a filename derived from the first-mentioned domain.
Question
Suppose there are multiple inequivalent certificates having the same first domain but different additional domains. There is the potential for conflict with the filename. How is this conflict resolved?
Suggestion
The stated goal is to make the process easy. To this end, it would be helpful for somebody who understands the process to document it in the help message.
