The automatic renewal that comes with our Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora/EPEL packages all already have a random sleep before renewal. As pointed out by @hlieberman, OS package maintainers can often handle this more elegantly. In the case of systemd (which almost all of our users use), rather than starting a Certbot process and letting it sleep, systemd can just delay starting the process for a random amount of time.
Harlan wanted to turn this off for the Debian packages, but doing so requires maintaining a patch to our code which is error prone and requires additional work. Instead, he asked if we could add a flag to disable this sleep. Only potential downside I see is copied and pasted command lines and Certbot getting yet another command line flag. I think we can maybe mitigate these issues though by giving it a good (and probably long) descriptive name and burying it in a help subtopic no one cares about.
