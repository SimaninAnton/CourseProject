Hi,
my certy are from yesterday and I test a cronjob....
# cat letsencrypt.cron 
#!/bin/sh
cd /...somepath.../tools/letsencrypt
./letsencrypt-auto renew -vvv --post-hook "service apache2 reload && service postfix restart"
But apache is reloaded and postfix ist restartet - in the output I see:
The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/somedomain.tl/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
2016-05-13 16:13:48,278:DEBUG:certbot.renewal:no renewal failures
2016-05-13 16:13:48,278:INFO:certbot.hooks:Running post-hook command: service apache2 reload && service postfix restart
Where is my mistake?
Thanks, Alex
