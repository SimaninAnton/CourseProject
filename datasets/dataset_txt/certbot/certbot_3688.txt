I was wondering how many people were still struggling on getting the project to run that are interested in development.
I realized that I had forgotten to make copying down options-ssl.conf down into /etc/letsencrypt/ as a required step to get the program to run. I think the program output was clear what the root of the problem was and shouldn't have been that difficult to solve. But it did make me wonder about the current developer state.
If there is any demand, I will get an IRC channel up and running and will be available to answer questions tomorrow in real-time.
I did post a ton of additional information under the Wiki which includes documentation, some guidance getting a server of your own running and a "how to contribute" section if you are looking for a way to get involved.
