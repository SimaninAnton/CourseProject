For various purposes (such as scripting or our own integration tests!) people will sometimes want to run the client in non-interactive mode. In such situations, it is a mistake to block on user input of any sort. We should offer a clear cli flag that causes the client to stop asking the user questions.
In non-interactive mode it may be acceptable to error out if some instruction is missing, though if at all possible that should be deterministic and happen immediately when the client is run, not partway through execution.
