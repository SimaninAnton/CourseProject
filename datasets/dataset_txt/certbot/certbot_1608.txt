I am trying to install certbot on Unix Solaris running Apache 2.4.23. I am at this page: https://certbot.eff.org/#pip-apache and have run the initial installation commands listed there:
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
When I attempt to run the 3rd command listed:
$ ./certbot-auto
I get the error in the subject line.
I would appreciate if someone could point me to a solution. Thank you.
