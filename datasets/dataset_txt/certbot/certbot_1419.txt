dream system test mechanism: specify input, base etc config, etc config modifications, and check expected output to stdout and etc files.
make sure all the expected files exist, check properties of the obtained cert, assert that Certbot output does (not) contain certain strings, etc.
make this super easy to specify, so that even for little things like this we could add a test case
