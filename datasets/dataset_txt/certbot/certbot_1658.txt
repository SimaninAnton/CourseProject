I am a bit lost here, my understanding is that, with these parameters:
• The output should be muted unless an error occurs
• More importantly the script shouldn't be trying to install/update/remove any packages
There is no way this is a bug where the command simply fails to acknowledge the parameters in a blanket fashion because I have not seen the issue reported anywhere else. There must be something in my configuration affecting the behavior?
