Using today's (30 minutes ago) git clone and running the following command:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a standalone -d MYDOMAIN --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-dev-preview
resulted in a private key with the following permissions:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1704 Nov 17 20:55 privkey1.pem
Not sure if the top folder with root only read permission is sufficent....
Except from with: WoW!
