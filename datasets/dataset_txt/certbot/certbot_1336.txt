Now that #492 has been resolved, I think we should stop using Quay.io entirely. Why?
Docker Hub is the conventional place for Docker images.
Our current repository there is letsencrypt/letsencrypt and I'm unaware of a way to rename it. I have control of the certbot name, however, I'm unaware of a way to redirect the current repository to certbot.
Do we really need both Quay.io and Docker Hub?
Proposal: Change the deprecation warning in Dockerfile-old to say that our Dockerfile has been rewritten and moved to Docker Hub. Set up automatic builds so the image there stays up to date. Once we've waited for an extended period of time and/or Quay.io requires active maintenance, we turn off the repository entirely.
Thoughts?
