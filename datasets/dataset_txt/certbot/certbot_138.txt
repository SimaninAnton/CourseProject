I'd like to have certbox-nginx as Docker/Ubuntu flavor (to setup an apt mirror).
What I've found out so far:
official certbot installation script does not work inside Docker with Ubuntu
https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/8326/certbot-installation-fails-inside-docker
there is a nginx Docker package available out there for certbot but it's for Alpine
https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt/
Any ideas?
