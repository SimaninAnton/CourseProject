My operating system is (include version):
CloudLinux 7.6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x ./certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/bin/certbot-auto renew
/bin/certbot-auto: line 754: [: 7.6: integer expression expected
/bin/certbot-auto: line 754: [: 7.6: integer expression expected
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
There is some problem with OS detection.
