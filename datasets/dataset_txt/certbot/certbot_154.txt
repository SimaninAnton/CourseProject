This is a followup from the research issue at #6903.
Ideally, mozilla/server-side-tls#198 is resolved and Mozilla updates their recommendations. If not, I think we should update our value in https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/options-ssl-nginx.conf.
Exactly what these values should be is up for discussion, however, nginx's default timeout of 5 minutes seems like a reasonable place to start to me. I don't know of the top of my head how I think the cache should be configured.
