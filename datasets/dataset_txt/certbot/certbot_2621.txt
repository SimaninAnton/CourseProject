Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: ~/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt run --apache --email ...@....... --redirect --agree-tos -d mysubdomain.mydomain.io.
Requested domain is not a FQDN
It is valid to refer to a domain using the trailing period, and I had expected letsencrypt would handle it as such too.
