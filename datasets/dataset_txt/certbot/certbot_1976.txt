./certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/api.naveoss.com/public_html/ -d api.naveoss.com
If I use --dry-run, or --staging I get:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.naveoss.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2016-09-28. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this
   certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot-auto renew"
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to tebruno99@gmail.com.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
However if I try to go live with a real cert:
Failed authorization procedure. api.naveoss.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to http://api.naveoss.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/hXD7XmAaqONHkdB8D64bl9hOqDzrBP6G1THd2VoBrQQ
