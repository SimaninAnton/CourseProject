My operating system is (include version):
Fedora 29
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
# git checkout v0.30.0
# ./certbot-auto -n
<bunch of stuff>
Creating virtual environment...
./certbot-auto: line 1003: virtualenv: command not found
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
virtualenv should probably be found.
