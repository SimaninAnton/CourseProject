Hi,
As noted in #16 there is no issue at the moment regarding a general purpose PHP client for the API, so this one is made to fill the void, collect feedback and more.
We will need a PHP client for the AlternC web panel [1] and if nothing is under work -as it seems now- we might produce one.
Open to suggestions and comments, along with general insights from people who are building / built clients with other languages.
Here are a few guidelines we'd follow :
Composer compatible
A namespaced library ie \ACME\ApiClient
PDO storage
