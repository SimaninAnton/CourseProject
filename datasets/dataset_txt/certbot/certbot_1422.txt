Using the Nginx installer on latest Certbot, I get prompted with "Easy / Secure." When I say yes (on a host that is already redirecting), I get this message:
The appropriate server block is already redirecting traffic. To enable redirect anyway, uncomment the redirect lines in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/blocktogether.org.
If we can detect the redirect is in place, can we skip the prompt?
