README.rst contains a few example shell commands using third-party domains as examples, e.g.
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone --email admin@thing.com -d thing.com -d www.thing.com -d otherthing.net
I think that using example.com and its siblings would be equally educative while it would not force the real owner of thing.com to deal with unsolicited mail arriving at admin@thing.com as people copy/paste this line into their shell.
