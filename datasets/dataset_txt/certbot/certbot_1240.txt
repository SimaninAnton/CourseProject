It seems like Certbot encounters numerous issues around distribution and dependency management.
It seems like freezing using a tool like cx_Freeze or PyInstaller would greatly simplify the experience for end-users: a release would be a sets of binaries, including all necessary dependencies, for each platform. The main drawback of this is that it means that new Certbot releases would be required to pick up fixes (including security fixes) in dependencies or Python itself, but it comes with a significant advantage that everyone using a given version of Certbot will be using a single well-known and tested version of each dependency.
Essentially: ship an end-user application instead of a collection of python modules.
Those who use Certbot as a library (and more savvy users who want control over the versions of dependencies used) could get Certbot via PIP.
