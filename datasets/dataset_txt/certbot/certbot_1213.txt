My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
acme.sh
I ran this command and it produced this output:
acme.sh --issue --dns -d inet.amaravti.net
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
.key file is empty
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
