recovery_routine is not consistently called when letsencrypt exits with an error, ex: when the DVSNI challenge fails. Maybe this is intentional, but users may not expect their server config files to be left in a weird state. Also, if the user then manually edits config files, those changes are lost when letsencrypt is run again.
