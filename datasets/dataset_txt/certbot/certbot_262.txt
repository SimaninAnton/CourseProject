In the User Guide (https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html), there are contradictory statements regarding the renewal of certificates. More specifically, I'm referring to the section named "Renewing certificates". It states:
Hooks will only be run if a certificate is due for renewal [...]
In the next sentence, it says:
--pre-hook and --post-hook hooks run before and after every renewal attempt.
I.e. the first sentence says that hooks wil only be run if something is due for renewal, and the second sentence says that the hooks are run for every attempt.
Which is correct?
