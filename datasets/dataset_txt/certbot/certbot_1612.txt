We should probably support the following things:
easy grepping to see if a cert is valid or not
future addition of OCSP checks for invalidity due to revocation
marking whether a cert is a test / staging cert!
change the "Valid Until" string to "Expiry Date", because it's confusing if an invalid/expired cert has a "Valid Until" listing, and someone might foolishly grep for "Valid", having never seen what an expired cert looks like.
