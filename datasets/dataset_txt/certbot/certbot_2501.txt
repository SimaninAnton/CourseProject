I have a QNAP NAS server at home and would like to issue a cert for the apache web server running on it. Unfortunately, the prerequisites seem to be unavailable and must be manually installed.
Is it posible to issue the cert in a VM running e.g. Ubuntu on a laptop and then copy the cert to QNAP NAS?
