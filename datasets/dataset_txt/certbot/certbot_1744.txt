Hi, i tried to run ./certbot-auto the first time on a fully patched Debian Squeeze and it fails with
Traceback (most recent call last):

I've also tried to change the "virtualenv" command manually in the certbot-auto script to virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python but it did'nt make a difference. Can anyone help!?
I think the 2 Deprecation Warnings are not the problem but iam not sure. And you see that it's a 32bit Squeeze but i hope this is not the problem.
