I've seen the document on dns challenges and noted that the only plugin installed in the container is the OVH one.
What the document doesn't mention is how the process works to provision a different provider (in my case, linode) for dns challenge support.
Hacking around in the container a bit I determined that the plugins are available through pip. Is there some mechanism already in the container to enable/use them or do I have to add my own scripts and customize?
