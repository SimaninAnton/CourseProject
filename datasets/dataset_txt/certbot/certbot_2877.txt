This may or may not be intended.
If you set webroot-path in your config and don't specify your domains, letsencrypt fails with the following error:
The webroot plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError('--webroot-path must be set',)
This is pretty confusing, both because webroot-path is set, and also because the code in question actually uses webroot-map, which is autogenerated in cli.py if both webroot and domains are specified upon invocation.
Previously this use pattern worked.
These changes were introduced in e1f0fcc and ffe6226.
