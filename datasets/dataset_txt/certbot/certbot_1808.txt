Recently I received e-mails from Letsencrypt regarding certificate expiration. Because I have certbot set up as a cronjob with the 'renew' argument, some of my certificates in the fullchain were automatically renewed, yet I noticed that some other certificates in the fullchain simply refused to renew. Even when I ran the command manually, I would get the following:
tiago@yyyyyyyy:/usr/local/certbot$ sudo /usr/local/certbot/certbot-auto renew

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/xxxxxxxx.com.conf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/xxxxxxxx.com/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted
This was really strange, since some of those certificates would expire soon, on October 1st and certbot didn't realize this. In the end I manually forced it with --force-renewal and all the certificates were renewed (less than ideal, since now my other certificates which had also recently been renewed, got renewed once more - not a problem, more of a nuisance).
Anyone else faced this issue? Is it a bug or just a problem in my configs?
