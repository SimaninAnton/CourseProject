Scenario:
I've got my webserver up and running already and I've got it sending anything matching .well-known/acme-challenge upstream to localhost:4443.
I want to run the python tool and have it update the certs it /etc/letsencrypt (for which my web server is already configured to read from) and then send SIGHUP to my webserver. This way there is no downtime and I can renew my certificates.
Currently there's no option to change from port 443 and so it would require taking down my webserver in order to run letsencrypt.
