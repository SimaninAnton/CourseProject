Similarly to how we did it in #5283.
Notes:
the biggest difference is PendingDeprecationWarning is shown by default in py 2.6 and isn't in py 3.3
also, while I didn't worry about this for python 3.3 since there were like 7 users, it'd be nice if we printed the warnings in a way that were able to be disabled by the user
(as for this, I think it would be nice and may be doable (you can set up logging to capture warnings if we wanted to be consistent in where they were sent), but if it's much effort don't worry about it
we're talking about the LE_PYTHON people and people installing from pip)
so if someone upgrades, they can see the warning but continue to use it in cron without getting email every 12 hours when certbot renew runs
probably the warning system is the best way to do this
it shouldn't be much code, but might take a little research
