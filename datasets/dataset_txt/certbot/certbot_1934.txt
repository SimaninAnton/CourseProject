The combination of the packages and the versions in the title causes problems as described in pyca/cryptography#2837. This problem was encountered in jessie-backports.
While we cannot bump our minimum PyOpenSSL version as CentOS 7 uses 0.13.1, perhaps we can find another workaround to a least make the problem clear for users/package maintainers.
