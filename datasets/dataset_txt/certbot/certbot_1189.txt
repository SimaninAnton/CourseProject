In 0.14.0 we added simple lockfiles to prevent concurrently running Certbot instances from corrupting your files. As you can see in #4449 (comment), some people had been running Certbot concurrently though. While doing this was unsafe (and undocumented), it'd be nice if things like certificate renewal could be run in parallel to speed up things for large integrations.
Doing this would be a significant increase in complexity to Certbot's locking mechanism though.
