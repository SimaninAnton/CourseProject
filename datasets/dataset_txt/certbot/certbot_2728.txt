I'm getting stuck when I try to install letsencrypt in OSX. It appears to have a dependency on virtualenv as an environment manager, but unfortunately my python environment uses conda instead (an alternative to virtualenv). Is there a way to get this to work in OSX without virtualenv, or alternatively, is there a distribution that will use an environment managed by conda instead?
Here are the last few lines of output when I tried to run ./letsencrypt-auto with the --debug flag, when it tries to install virtualenv:

WARNING: using virtualenv with Anaconda is untested and not recommended.
    We suggest using the conda command to create environments instead.

Honestly, all I really want for now is to get a CRT that I can upload into a shared hosting account through cpanel (until I have a chance to set up my own VPS).
