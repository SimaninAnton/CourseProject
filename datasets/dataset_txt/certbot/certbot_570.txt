I am on an embedded system, similar to #5556. However, I have a more basic request:
1.) Commands which do not alter anything, like
certbot certificates
Should work without file system write access.
2.) Nice to have would be, when certbot would only access file system between pre-hook and post-hook on renewal, as I originally wanted to use them to remount the file system writable before and readonly after renewal.
Currently certbot wants to create a lock file in any case and expecially before executing the pre-hook:
[Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/etc/letsencrypt/.certbot.lock'
I am on ubuntu btw.
