Two different people are seeing 404 errors on renewal because their client is somehow appending a number (different for each of them) to the directory URI (despite these numbers seemingly not being present in the server variables in the renewal configs!).
I thought we saw something like this before, but the number was then actually present in the renewal config then, where in this case it appears not to be. I don't know why the client would modify the directory location in this way.
