Currently, the client produces three binaries - /usr/bin/letsencrypt, /usr/bin/letsencrypt-renewer, and /usr/bin/jws. However, the sphinx build of documentation only includes a single manpage - letsencrypt.1.
Please create manpages for the other installed binaries, if they are needed. If they're not needed, let me know, and I will prune them from the Debian packaging.
