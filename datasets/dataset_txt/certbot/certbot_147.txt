Hi,
Would it be safer to exclude editor backups (*~) when renewal-hooks are run?
Per your request, it was posted here first. Thank you!
Kind regards,

My operating system is (include version):
Debian testing
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
0.31.0-1 via apt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew --force-renewal
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Editor backup files are run when executing renewal hooks. I expected them to be ignored.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
