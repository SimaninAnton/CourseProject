I'm working on installing setuptools on OS X 10.11.4, I have an Anaconda python install and pip installed virtualenv, but I keep getting this error when I try and install letsencrypt. I also tried updating setuptools using pip but that didn't help either. Any thoughts on how to fix this would be appreciated. Thanks!
