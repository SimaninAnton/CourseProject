While it works on iPhone and Chrome on Macbook Pro, on some android devices (One Plus X, Intex) both chrome and default browsers, it says Cert Authority is INVALID. Tried this on my website (www.abhisheknandi.com) to confirm everything is fine and finally I added it on my company dashboard and APIs. Now am not sure whether to revoke it and buy one like old days or do I wait for something to get fixed?
Clearly Let's Encrypt Authority X3 is not added as a trusted authority in certain cases. Please help.
