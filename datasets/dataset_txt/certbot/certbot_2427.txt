Right now some code derives paths from the "lineage name", defined as the portion of the renewal config basename that precedes the traiiling .conf. For renewal/successor purposes, there is no apparent need to do this because all of the path components are explicitly specified inside the file.
A consequence of the current behavior is that you can't safely rename a renewal config file, even if you don't change its contents.
A benefit of the current behavior is a form of referential integrity checking: if example.com.conf doesn't exist, it's automatically safe to create ../archive/example.com/, which wouldn't be true if renewal config files could be renamed. On the other hand, users can simply rename them now with mv, but they can get various unexpected errors after doing so.
Improving this behavior would also be useful when thinking about changes and migrations in the /etc/letsencrypt tree, for example the suggestion to separate private and public keys into separate directory hierarchies.
