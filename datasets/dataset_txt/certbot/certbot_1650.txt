While landing #3751 we noticed that it might be nice to test a potentially fragile behaviour it adds, namely that if a config has preexisting redirects in it, and the user requests a redirect twice, it should have our commented-out suggested redirect, but only one copy of it.
This could be added as an nginx integration test (or, with more work, as a compatibility test). We decided to kick it down the road though!
