I'm not sure where this is happening in the renewer logic, but the renewer can give up and not attempt any subsequent lineage renewals if a single lineage renewal fails.
When fixing this we should also check that the renewer exits with nonzero status if any renewal failed (but that it still attempts the other ones).
