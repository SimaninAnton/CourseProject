The Nginx plugin's options-ssl-nginx.conf file uses Mozilla's current intermediate SSL cipher configuration.
The Apache plugin probably did too... except it hasn't been updated since 2014: 2faacc1
Should Certbot's Apache settings be updated?
The main difference is that the new configuration adds ChaCha20 cipher suites. (It also removes a few things.)
Should this wait until after further documentation/feature improvements in #4830?
If so, how about a stopgap patch to add ChaCha20 without removing anything?
Differences with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1.0:
Adds ChaCha20. (Yay!)
Adds newer 3DES cipher suites with key exchange/signature algorithms other than RSA/RSA. (Probably doesn't matter. Anything that supports ECDHE-ECDSA ought to support a better cipher than 3DES. ) (Edit: Mozilla suggests that EDH-RSA 3DES is useful, though,.)
Removes AES-CCM. (OpenSSL 1.1. Probably only included inadvertently.)
Removes Camellia. (Perfectly nice cipher, but everybody uses AES.)
Removes some static DH and SRP key exchange cipher suites. (Probably only included by accident, mostly or entirely ignored by servers and clients.)
Changes the order of some things.
