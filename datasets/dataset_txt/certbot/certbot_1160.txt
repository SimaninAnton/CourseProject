After talking to the maintainers we're going to make https://github.com/lifeonmarspt/certbot-route53 an official plugin and move it into our repo. Things we want with this transition are:
Git history is preserved
We have a plugin under the name certbot-dns-route53 in our tree
We have a plugin or at least something to upload to the name certbot-route53 on PyPI so users under that name continue to get updates as the plugin is further developed. In theory, this could be the same package as certbot-dns-route53 but we'd want to make sure the user experience is sane if both are installed.
The certbot-route53 package should continue to work with the plugin name certbot-route53:auth due to the way we name 3rd party plugins (see #4351). Whether or not it also works with certbot-route53 is an implementation detail in my opinion.
I don't really have a preference for how this is implemented. My instinct is it'll be easiest to make certbot-route53 a shim package around certbot-dns-route53. We did something similar for the letsencrypt package in our 0.7.0 release. This can be left up to whoever takes this ticket though.
@zjs, if you have an interest in working on this, that'd be useful, otherwise, I can take it when I get some spare cycles.
