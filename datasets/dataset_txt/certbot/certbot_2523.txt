letsencrypt failed on our server when parsing our apache2.4 config. It turned out that the config files where the error happens are standard apache2 modules.
The error message is "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'" in letsencrypt_apache/parser.py", line 311.
We created pull request #2105 to demonstrate this behavior and to help with TTD ;-).
Thanks for providing this great project!
