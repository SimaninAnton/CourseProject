Hello, i was updating debian OS version recently and since that i am unable to run ./certbot-auto and my SSL certificates will expire soon.
I was not able to find out how to fix.
Full result of attempt can be seen here: https://gist.github.com/Lexinek/9958af45b71da4848b649873ac7138a0
Any suggestions are welcomed,
thanks.
