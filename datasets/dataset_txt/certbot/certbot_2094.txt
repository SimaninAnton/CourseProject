When redirect all http connections to https setting enabled in vhost autoconfiguration. Installer adds RewritCond and RewriteRule, but redirection doesn't work, because of missing RewriteEngine on -line.
Problem solved by adding this line manually. So please add it to the script. It was all good in former letsencrypt-script.
