My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Desktop(amd64)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
#I ran
myid@mycomputer:~/doc/SSL/certbot$ sudo ./certbot-auto
and it produced this output
......

Failed to find executable apache2ctl in PATH:

Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system. 
However, it can still get a certificate for you. Please run "certbot-auto certonly" to do so. 
You'll need to manually configure your web server to use the resulting certificate.




## Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:

#I got XAMPP(latest version) for linux and it runs apache server when I use control panel for it.
And I found the name of executable apache file is not named as 'apache2ctl', 
but named 'httpd' in /opt/lampp/bin directory
and I guess the Certbot can't find the relative files to it.
And I found that my computer has httpd.conf in /opt/lampp/etc


#when I type
~/문서/SSL/certbot$ ./certbot-auto --help apache
I get the below

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert. 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        path to config file (default: /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
                        and ~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini)
  --tls-sni-01-port TLS_SNI_01_PORT
                        Port used during tls-sni-01 challenge. This only
                        affects the port Certbot listens on. A conforming ACME
                        server will still attempt to connect on port 443.
                        (default: 443)

## Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
###### Logs are stored in `/var/log/letsencrypt` by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.


# I want to know what I could do to run the Certbot moderately without uninstall the XAMPP.

If you could point out where and how I should modify, I would follow it.

Thank you very much for all your efforts.
