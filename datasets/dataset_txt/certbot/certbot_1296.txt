This issue is mainly motivated to make #4434 easier, but it's nice to have a common place for setting these values rather than setting some in cli.py and some in constants.py. HelpfulArgumentParser in cli.py could maybe even be modified to no longer take a default value when an argument is added and instead take it from the config.
