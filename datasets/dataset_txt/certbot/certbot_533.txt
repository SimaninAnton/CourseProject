If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.9 (Santiago)
Python 2.7 (redhat scl python27)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto (0.24.0)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/root/bin/certbot-auto -q renew --post-hook /root/bin/certbot-renew-hook
FailedChallenges: Failed authorization procedure. site.example.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Incorrect validation certificate for tls-sni-01 challenge. Requested whatever.acme.invalid from IP.AD.DR.ESS:443. Received 2 certificate(s), first certificate had names "other.example.com"
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It could have included apachectl -S output (which would help debugging)
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.

Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
Fwiw, here's my normal -S output (minus a number of other hosts that aren't implicated by the output from certbot:
127.0.0.1:443          is a NameVirtualHost
         default server other.example.com (/etc/httpd/conf.d/001-other-ssl-localhost.conf:1)
         port 443 namevhost site.example.com (/etc/httpd/conf.d/103-site-ssl-localhost.conf:1)
wildcard NameVirtualHosts and _default_ servers:
*:443                  is a NameVirtualHost
         default server other.example.com (/etc/httpd/conf.d/001-other-ssl.conf:1)
         port 443 namevhost site.example.com (/etc/httpd/conf.d/003-site-ssl.conf:1)
         port 443 namevhost site.example.com (/etc/httpd/conf.d/103-site-ssl.conf:1)
*:80                   is a NameVirtualHost
