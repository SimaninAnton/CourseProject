As suggested at #7282 (comment), in adding test farm tests for RHEL 8, I had to add some temporary code totests/letstest/scripts/test_leauto_upgrades.sh to keep things working until we do a release of certbot-auto containing RHEL 8 support. After we do that, we should delete that temporary code and update the initial version used in the script.
