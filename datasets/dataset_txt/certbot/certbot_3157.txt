I've identified another issue with augeas.
I already know about #981 and I was able to patch my own system to avoid that issue; However, it seems that even the new httpd lens fails when a config file includes regular expressions.
I have 11 config files in my folder, and augeas reports “syntax errors” for exactly those files which make use of mod_rewrite. mod_rewrite is an apache module which uses regular expressions for configuration.
At this point, I would suggest that we patch the lens ourselves as we wouldn't want to wait for a new version of augeas.
