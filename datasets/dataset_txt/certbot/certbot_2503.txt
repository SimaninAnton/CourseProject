It seems like Letsencrypt client can only work with official CA: API endpoint https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory is hardcoded in Python sources.
But I guess that ability of setting private Boulder address would be of great help to the ones who need local CA and deploy private Boulder servers.
