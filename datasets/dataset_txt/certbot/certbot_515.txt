F.e. when using certbot in Docker (with the official certbot image), it's good practice to have a read-only volume for the config directory. However, this gives the following error:
letsencrypt_1    | Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
letsencrypt_1    | The following error was encountered:
letsencrypt_1    | [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt/.certbot.lock'
letsencrypt_1    | Either run as root, or set --config-dir, --work-dir, and --logs-dir to writeable paths.
I did set work-dir = /tmp/certbot, so it's only the config directory that is not writable.
