authentication (proof of domain control) for ACME will be possible via dns txt records.
dns updates (of dynamic zones) can be done via the nsupdate cmdline tool or any other rfc2136 compatible client (e.g. the dnspython library has code for that), so that one does not have to automatically modify configuration or data files of misc. nameserver implementations.
i think this authenticator might be nice for various reasons:
there are lots of different webserver softwares out there and we can't support them all like the few most popular ones [and even for the popular ones, it might take some time until done], so an alternative way of authentication is needed
if one does not want a certificate for https usage, but something else, using an external webserver just to prove control is a bit weird
does not depend on a specific nameserver as it uses rfc2136 dynamic updates (nameserver just needs to support that)
with a fake "nsupdate" tool that just prints stdin and waits for a key press, manual dns updates for zones without dynamic update capability are possible
nameserver does not need to be on same machine as no config file access or restarting is required
does not require root for authentication
