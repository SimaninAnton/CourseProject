I've attempted to run renewer.py (am I meant to?)
It used to run through perfectly and just not renew anything. I never actually got to test it renewing automatically. However, recently I updated the letsencrypt repository and it no longer works now that a renewal is due. It fails with a stack trace:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt-renewer", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())

    renew(cert, old_version)

    return getattr(self.namespace, name)

Seems a new config entry was added but my conf files don't contain it. Any thoughts on updating the conf file?
