Hello
I want to know where is the account/client key getting stored
Want to extract the client key from a working Certbot environment,
the task isn’t to extract the SSL certificates and keys. Rather it is to extract the ACME client account key used for authentication to the ACME server.
I guess It’s a public/private key pair associated to the ACME client when it first registers with the server.
I see some of it in /etc/letsencrypt/accounts/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory/80332f4536b5b08a976dd483c4078ad4
meta.json
private_key.json
regr.json
but the private_key.json has some generated RSA key pair in JWK format
How do i just get the acocunt/client key
Can someone help me with the location
