If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Raspbian Stretch Lite, version april 2019 (freshly installed
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Followin the guide: https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianstretch-nginx
Rasbian does not have stretch-backports So I picked buster.
$ sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx -t buster
This worked as did $ sudo certbot --nginx
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ certbot-auto renew
output:

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libssl-dev : Depends: libssl1.1 (= 1.1.0j-1~deb9u1) but 1.1.1b-2 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The error is in the end: libssl-dev : Depends: libssl1.1 (= 1.1.0j-1~deb9u1) but 1.1.1b-2 is to be installed
How to handle this?
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
I checked /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log no problems there. since this is an installing problem I'll keep this out for now. (will add if needed)
