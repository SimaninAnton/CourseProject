My operating system is:
Debian 8.7
I installed Certbot with:
apt-get and jessie-backports
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --apache certonly
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ssl-conf.conf', 'Syntax error'),)
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue:
letsencrypt.txt
ssl-conf.txt
I can't see any Syntax Error in this Config file, may you can?
