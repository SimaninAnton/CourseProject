From the output of "certbot -h":
manage your account with Let's Encrypt:
    register        Create a Let's Encrypt ACME account
    unregister      Deactivate a Let's Encrypt ACME account
    update_account  Update a Let's Encrypt ACME account
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications
Since these subcommands translate to generic ACME protocol messages (rather than anything that's specific to Let's Encrypt's ACME server), please could this be changed to...
manage your account:
    register        Create an ACME account
    unregister      Deactivate an ACME account
    update_account  Update an ACME account
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications
