I manage my servers' SSL using acme_tiny. I have a LE email registration and an account private key.
I'd would like to change this email (acme_tiny does not provide such an advanced feature). Thus I finally installed certbot for this sole purpose.
But it happens that certbot register --update-registration --email does not accept a simple --private-key=<PATH> but rather expects a full installation/initiatialization/setup/... phase
Am I overlooking something or is it that certbot can't update the email in a simple/one-shot command run?
