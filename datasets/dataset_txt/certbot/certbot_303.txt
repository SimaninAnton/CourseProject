A very common issue on the forums is users who find that --apache or --nginx does not function when the webserver configuration suffers from the non-fatal (but fatal for Certbot) issue of duplicate virtual hosts, when using name-based virtualhosts.
Today's incidence: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/well-known-acme-challenge-issues-w-expired-cert/80711/6?u=_az
Certbot might:
Refuse to run if there are two virtual hosts
Apply changes to all virtual hosts
Prompt the user to select which virtualhost to use
Detect which of the duplicate virtualhosts the webserver would choose and only work with that one.
