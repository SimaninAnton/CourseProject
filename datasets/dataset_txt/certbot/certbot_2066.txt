At debug level -vv, we log HTTP request and response bodies. It would be nice to bump up the required log level for this level of detail to -vvv so our test runs could be a little quieter.
Also, the printed bodies are escaped and smooshed onto one line. It would be nice to print them literally as they would be seen in HTTP, across multiple lines. This will make it much easier to read the bodies when debugging issues. Right now they are very difficult to use as a diagnostic, and they also clutter up our test logs.
