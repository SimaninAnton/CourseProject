If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.

locate certbot

Who renamed the executable for FreeBSD Port: security/py-certbot?
why?
Did you update the docs on the certbot website as well?
Why did letsencrypt not notify users of their solution of this change?
Why is this not added to UPDATING?
Thank you for your support for open source!
