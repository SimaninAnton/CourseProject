Hearing this off of TWiT's Security Now podcast, episode 483. I'm interested! But I'm running lighttpd.
Thankfully configuring SSL is simple. Here's an example from my own server (I have existing free certs through StartSSL):
$SERVER["socket"] == ":443" {
    ssl.engine = "enable"
    ssl.pemfile = "/etc/ssl/domain.pem"
    ssl.ca-file = "/etc/ssl/ca-certs.crt"
    server.document-root = "/home/web-secure/public_html"
}
I would suggest a few command line options to indicate:
Path to web domain's public files.
Path to web domain's secured public files.
Path to command to generate configuration modules (to support other web servers as well), having it be passed through via STDIN.
My main go-to scripting language in Linux is Perl, alas. Looks like I'll have to pick up Python 2 and 3.
