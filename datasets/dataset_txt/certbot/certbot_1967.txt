Hello,
been using letsencrypt for some time now, after rename I deleted /opt/letsencrypt and moved to apt-get install certbot.
Debian 8.5
from time to time im getting email (on root):
WARNING:certbot.renewal:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/DOMAIN.conf produced an unexpected error: The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your exisitng configuration. The error was: NoInstallationError(). Skipping. The following certs are not sue for renewal yet:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain2/fullchain.pem (skipped)
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain3/fullchain.pem (skipped)
All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem (failure)
conf is:
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/cert.pem
privkey = /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
chain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/chain.pem
fullchain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem

# Options used in the renewal process
[renewalparams]
authenticator = apache
installer = apache
account = account_hash
Fun part is that running 'dry' or by hand resolve this problem until the time it hits it again.
DRY RUN: simulating 'certbot renew' close to cert expiry
          (The test certificates below have not been saved.)

Congratulations, all renewals succeeded. The following certs have been renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain2/fullchain.pem (success)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem (success)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain3/fullchain.pem (success)
