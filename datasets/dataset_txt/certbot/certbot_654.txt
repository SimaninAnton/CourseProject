According to wikipedia, ubuntu is "the most popular server Linux distribution". It's odd then that the page at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html doesn't contain the word "ubuntu" at all.
Worse, following the debian instructions:
sudo apt-get install certbot
results in "Unable to locate package certbot" with the current ubuntu LTS (16.04).
Seems like a big documentation fail to me. :(
