Hello,
I just try to test the renew like this:
./letsencrypt-auto renew -v --dry-run
and the log says:
2016-05-12 21:03:20,463:DEBUG:certbot.main:Root logging level set at 20

Error: Currently, the renew verb is only capable of renewing all installed certificates that are due to be renewed; individual domains cannot be specified with this action. If you would like to renew specific certificates, use the certonly command. The renew verb may provide other options for selecting certificates to renew in the future.
I use a cli.ini with
authenticator = webroot
webroot-map = {....some domains which are correctly installed with certonly command }
Any idea?
Thanks, Alex
