I'm having some problems running letsencrypt on Debian Jessie
./letsencrypt-auto --help
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies...
Nothing appears to happen, and no error is reported.
Looking at the script source, I found a debug flag:
./letsencrypt-auto -v
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies...
Cannot fetch index base URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/
Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement setuptools in /home/anton/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Downloading/unpacking setuptools
Cleaning up...
No distributions at all found for setuptools in /home/anton/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Storing debug log for failure in /home/anton/.pip/pip.log
Looking at the pip log shows several lines like
Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/setuptools/: connection error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:581)
Will skip URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/setuptools/ when looking for download links for setuptools in /home/anton/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Now, I'll admit that the underlying cause is probably a debian bug in ssl certificates, however shell script should really be detecting this and reporting that it failed to configure environment
Python version is: Python 2.7.9
