The standalone plugin will no longer respect the new --preferred-challenges flag.
this can easily be seen for instance by starting a process that will occupy port 443, and limiting preferred challenges to challenges that will not use that port:
This works fine:
certbot-auto certonly --force-renewal --standalone --standalone-supported-challenges http-01
But this new syntax will bomb out
certbot-auto certonly --force-renewal --standalone --preferred-challenges http-01
with "MisconfigurationError: At least one of the (possibly) required ports is already taken." .. because it tests 443 despite being told not to.
This is probably just a problem in the commandline parsing somewhere, or a function referring back the old config values.
