Hi,
I was looking for clues here #1294 (comment), but nothing helps. Also, I've searched server.conf file for some most common issues like missing double quotes and case problems - nothing found. Apachectl configtest says "Syntax OK". Maybe I've missed something?
Here is the error message from console: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/httpd/conf/plesk.conf.d/server.conf', u'Syntax error'),)
Here is the file's content (ips was changed): http://pastebin.com/BsNGehsa
@domcleal if you still providing your help in this matter, please welcome!
