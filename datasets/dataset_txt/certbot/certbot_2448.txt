When I specify a webroot path but don't specify a domain, the error message says I didn't specify a webroot, which is misleading:
ubuntu@srv-1gybf:~/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /home/ubuntu/app/current/public 
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: sudo /home/ubuntu/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /home/ubuntu/app/current/public
The webroot plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError('--webroot-path must be set',)
When I specify the domain, it works of course:
ubuntu@srv-1gybf:~/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /home/ubuntu/app/current/public  -d example.com
