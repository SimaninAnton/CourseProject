Hello,
I tried to do this myself for couple hours but did not success.
My web server is a haproxy docker image that I deployed through cloud.docker.com onto a physical machine I created at www.packet.net
What's the proper way to get a certificate to serve https?
The docker image allows set certificate through env variable only. So does this mean I must to obtain it manually?
Thank you!
