I've run ./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d domain.tld, it correctly found the virtualhost and changed paths in SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile, didn't touch SSLCACertificateFile, and also didn't add any SSLCertificateChainFile.
runing ./letsencrypt-auto config_changes shows that it set SSLCertificateFile, SSLCertificateKeyFile, SSLCertificateChainFile which is inconsistent with what happened.
