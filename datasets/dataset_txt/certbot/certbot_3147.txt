I'm not sure, if the GitHub issue tracker is the correct place to report this, but I noticed a small inaccuracy in the documentation at the following URL:
https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#plugins
It states that the "manual" plugin must be used/ activated with --a manual. This triggers an error stating that the --a parameter is ambiguous. I guess, the documentation should be updated to show --authenticator manual (at least that's what I used in the end and worked for me. )
Additionally it is not very obvious what the "A" and "I" table columns are about (at least I can only do wild guesses). Perhaps the table headers could have some hover tip with the full meaning of "A" and "I"?
