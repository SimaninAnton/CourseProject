My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
The Instructions that were provided, I've installed it the same way for other domains too and always worked fine.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
do you know how I can fix this? SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER
https://galaxycheats.com/
https://www.galaxycheats.com/ works fine for some reason
sudo certbot --apache -d galaxycheats.com -d www.galaxycheats.com
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
www.galaxycheats.com works fine, without www. it gives the Unknown issuer warning
do you know how I can fix this? SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER
https://galaxycheats.com/
https://www.galaxycheats.com/ works fine for some reason
command I'm using:
sudo certbot --apache -d galaxycheats.com -d www.galaxycheats.com
I used the EXACT same command for Nexusblocks.com (sudo certbot --apache -d nexusblocks.com -d www.nexusblocks.com)
and there it worked fine both www and without it....? so why is it not working on my new domain?
