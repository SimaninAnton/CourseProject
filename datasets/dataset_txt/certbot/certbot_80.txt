This can only be done after we've released a version printing a deprecation warning.
To do this though, we need to:
Remove Python 3.4 from the classifiers in setup.py for each package.
Update the python_requires value in each packages setup.py file to exclude Python 3.4.
Update any tests in .travis.yml using Python 3.4 to a newer version of Python or delete the test entirely. (Done in #7394)
Remove the deprecation warnings added in #7378.
Update any files such as contributing.rst or install.rst to not claim support for Python 3.4. (Done in #7395)
