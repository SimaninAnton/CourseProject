My operating system is (include version):
Any (mine is Ubuntu)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Any, but mine was from pip
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --csr file.csr -d OCG-SZ1-CMT.example.com
where file.csr has a request for a domain name with upper case letters in it.
Inconsistent domain requests:
From the CSR: OCG-SZ1-CMT.example.com
From command line/config: ocg-sz1-cmt.example.com
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Domain names are supposed to be case insensitive. It should not matter that the name is mixed case in the CSR.
