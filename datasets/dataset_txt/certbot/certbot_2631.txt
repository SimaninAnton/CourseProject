Thanks for the tutorial. Very helpful.
Seems the default version of python supplied with Ubuntu 14.04 may need some extra updates to run letsencrypt.
I needed to update python's ssl libraries:
apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
apt-get install python-pip
pip install 'requests[security]'
pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1
Then I needed to import ssl into python.
python
import ssl
quit()
Also, I found my domain name example.com must have an A record on the DNS server
and it must be the same IP address as the A record for www.example.com
A CNAME DNS record for www.example.com is not sufficient -- it must be an A record.
