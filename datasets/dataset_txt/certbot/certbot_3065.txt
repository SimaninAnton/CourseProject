This overlaps with item #1286 but comes at things from a different angle.
According to https://letsencrypt.github.io/acme-spec/, the raison d'Ãªtre for ACME is to provide a good user interface, to provide good usability.
From a UI point of view, it is not reasonable to require root privileges for ./letsencrypt-auto --help
It is irrelevant and pointless to say that because of the way it's written, it requires root privileges. The relevant point is, it shouldn't be written that way. A good UI should be written in such a way that it can provide an informative message no matter what. One way (not the only way) of doing this would be to incorporate a helpful message within the letsencrypt-auto shell script ... and to check for the --help option before checking for root privileges.
