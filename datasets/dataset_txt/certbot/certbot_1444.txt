(ref: /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/example.com.conf)

What would you like to do?

1: Attempt to reinstall this existing certificate
2: Renew & replace the cert (limit ~5 per 7 days)

I'm exhausted. I'd like certbot to speak to me in simple English.
The entirety of the last line is weird:
the cli is a conversation between a user and certbot. I don't expect to have certbot speak to me in the third person (User chose). Note that earlier it said You have.
reinvoke is just awkward. I think you may re-run the client would be friendlier.
