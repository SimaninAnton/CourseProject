My operating system is (include version):
ubuntu 16.04 LTS
certbot 0.14.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
letsencrypt-auto renew
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
my certifcates are always renewed when i call letsencrypt-auto renew.
from the docs i thought this should only happen if my certifcate expires in less than 30 days.
when i check the certifcate with
openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/xxxx/fullchain.pem
i get
Validity
           Not Before: May 11 09:06:00 2017 GMT
           Not After : Aug  9 09:06:00 2017 GMT
i also see new files in /etc/letsencrypt/archive/xxx
