If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
yum install epel-release // was already installed
yum install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --version
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It gave me this error
Traceback (most recent call last):

I've encountered this issue so many times but I always google around until it works but I can't find a solution anymore.
I tried certbot-auto, but all my scripts rely on certbot, I just want to install it, that's all :(
