I'm trying to use the Python ACME client in the staging environment for testing (using https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory). However, I'm getting this error:
acme.messages.Error: urn:acme:error:rateLimited :: There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new registration :: too many registrations for this IP: see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/
It's happening when I call acme.client.Client(...).register(). Do I have to do something different with this for staging?
