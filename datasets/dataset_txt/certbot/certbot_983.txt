Dear certbot team,
It would be really cool if certbot could talk to freeIPA DNS service in order to validate a domain.
Lemme explain the usecase:
We're managing a public DNS zone with a FreeIPA cluster, and are wanting to set up Let's Encrypt certificates for some services. We can't rely on the "http" validation, because the application is running on a cluster (if I say "openstack horizon on three controllers"…).
Thus, the best way to get the certificate would be to do a DNS validation, meaning certbot must be able to talk to our freeIPA.
Of course, we might as well use the "manual" way, providing a --manual-auth-hook script doing the API calls against freeIPA, but… I can't think we're the only one in that case. Are we?
Thank you in advance for your support, and a big to the certbot project :).
Cheers,
C.
