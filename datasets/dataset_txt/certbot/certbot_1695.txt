I had this happen to me today and found the issue to be lines with a pound sign (#) only, which I had a comment on, but deleted and left the pound sign.
ie.
# mod_rewrite <IfModule mod_rewrite> ... </IfModule>
to
# <-------- fails parsing here <IfModule mod_rewrite> ... </IfModule>
caused
"The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/000-default.conf', u'Syntax error'),)"
I hope you can figure out what I mean as I can't figure out how to make the code tags above hold formatting and not place everything on one line.
