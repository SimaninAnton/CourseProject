If you attempt to enter either "ai" or "ai." (same with to), the installer complains about it not being a valid FQDN. It is a valid FQDN, and the installer should allow it to proceed with validation. Oddly enough, the installer does treat user@tld properly for email entry.
Other TLDs such as IO used to also have websites hosted directly on their TLD. ai and to are just two such examples of websites being hosted directly on a TLD.
