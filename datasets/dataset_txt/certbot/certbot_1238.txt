My operating system is (include version):
CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
following https://certbot.eff.org/#centosrhel7-nginx
sudo yum install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --webroot -w /opt/Foo -d www.foo.com
Traceback (most recent call last):

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
ImportError: No module named contrib.pyopenssl
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
