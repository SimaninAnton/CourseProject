This is a bit of an awkward issue but to post this somewhere trackable:
Update certbot.eff.org to show a short message about what's going on with useful links.
Try and properly handle redirects and proxying for HTTP01 in Apache. Failing that, include logging about the error.
Ensure HTTP01 challenge succeeds in nginx when the server is not currently listening on the HTTP01 port.
