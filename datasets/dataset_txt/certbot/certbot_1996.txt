We should create an issue template for this repo to help make sure we get relevant information from a user reporting a new issue. Potential questions we could include in the template are:
Which OS are you using?
How did you install Certbot?
What command(s) did you run?
What did you expect?
What was the result?
Can you provide a log of the problem?
We want to be careful not to discourage users from opening new issues, but getting this information up front allows us to better solve a user's problem.
