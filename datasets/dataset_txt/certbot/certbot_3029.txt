If the user ran "letsencrypt certonly" and then runs "letsencrypt install", it's very counter-intuitive that they need to find their cert in /etc/letsencrypt/live, know that they should use fullchain.pem rather than cert.pem, and then find the matching key in /etc/letsencrypt/keys. We use all of the storage.py mechanisms by default.
