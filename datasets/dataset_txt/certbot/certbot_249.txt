Hi i receibe a email about TLS-SNI-01
i verify and my system had certbot 0.25
but after upgrade the new version is 0.17.0 and is block in this version.
i not sure if is related but i use ubuntu 17, maybe you have a typo bug in the ppa?
My operating system is (include version):
ubuntu 17
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --version
certbot 0.17.0
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade certbot

certbot is already the newest version (0.17.0-2).
Calculating upgrade... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
cerbot version shoul be 0.28.0 or more
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):

Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
