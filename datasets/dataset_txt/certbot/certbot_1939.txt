Dear Team.
I'm using apache, and I have two conf files(archersmind.conf and ssister.conf) for my sites. I'm not sure if letsencrypt support this. Since every time I run the command
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d archersmind.com -d www.archersmind.com
It always return
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: archersmind.com
   Type:   unknownHost
   Detail: No valid IP addresses found for archersmind.com

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
I'm pretty sure that I have enter the right domain name and DNS contains the right IP address.
And My conf file is like
archersmind.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerAlias www.archersmind.com
    ServerName archersmind.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        </Directory>
    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
        </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>
ssister.conf is similarity.
Thank You
