I have a question concerning useability for intranet based / behind the firewall servers.
We like to change everything to HTTPS, including our intranet servers, and (at least personally) I'd like to do that with "normal" certs, i.e. not self-signed. Less trouble with pushing our self-signing root cert to clients, trust store management etc. etc. etc.
I thought letsencrypt would be the ideal alternative, but from reading the specs etc I'm getting the impression that using letsencrypt behind the firewall might be difficult if not impossible.
Is it possible? Perhaps in manual mode?
