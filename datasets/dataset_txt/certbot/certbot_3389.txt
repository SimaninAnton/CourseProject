#726, #752 and #754 are affected by annoying race condition that causes Travis build to fail randomly (see https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/builds/77715204, https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/builds/78978888, https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/builds/78990354, resp.).
It seems that manual authenticator doesn't manage to bootstrap on time before we proceed to simple_verify.
