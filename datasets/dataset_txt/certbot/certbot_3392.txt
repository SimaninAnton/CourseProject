Passing the webroot via the command line it would help for those sites that have non-standard web roots i.e. frameworks like Laravel and node.js web apps would likely have their /path/to/projectname/public as their web root. WHM/Cpanel, Directadmin, Webmin etc all would have their own web root paths.
If you can pass this as a variable in Letsencrypt client, it will probably be easier for respective control panels and distros to come up with their own integration methods ?
