PROBLEM: the default (see ubuntuxenial-nginx recommendation) of the most popular Linux is not working, because generates a Weak-DH "bug".
WORKAROUND: a terminal sequence of commands... not is a real solution.
SOLUTION: the certbot --nginx command must detect the problem (eg. by checking /etc/nginx/ssl/ folder existence) and run internally the "workaround instructions".
