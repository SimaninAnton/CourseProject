My operating system is (include version):
Scientific Linux 6.9
python 2.6 (yeah I know...)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto, 0.14.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Creating virtual environment...
Installing Python packages...
Had a problem while installing Python packages.

pip prints the following errors:
