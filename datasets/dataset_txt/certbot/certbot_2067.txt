In reviewing #3026, I realized we can move letsencrypt-auto-source to certbot-auto-source (as well as rename letsencrypt-auto and letsencrypt-auto.sig. This is largely because letsencrypt-auto looks at specific tags in our repo for new versions of itself so changes in master do not affect the script.
