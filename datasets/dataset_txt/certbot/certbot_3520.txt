Using the Apache configurator, running the client with
sudo ~/venv/bin/letsencrypt --work-dir yowl run
persistently breaks the client, even when subsequently run with an ordinary
sudo ~/venv/bin/letsencrypt run
For reasons I haven't been able to deduce, on all subsequent client invocations Apache complains about not being able to find /etc/letsencrypt/le_dvsni_cert_challenge.conf.
