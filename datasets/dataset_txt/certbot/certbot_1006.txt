My operating system is (include version):
17.04 Ubunutu
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/certbot/certbot/ubuntu/dists/jessie/main/binary-amd64/Packages 404 No t Found

Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
