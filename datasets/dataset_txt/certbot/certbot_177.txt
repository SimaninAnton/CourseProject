Running certbot-auto on Debian Jessie, since the automatic upgrade to 0.34.0 each calls to certbot-auto outputs a new line
/usr/local/sbin/certbot-auto -q renew | hexdump -C
00000000  0a                                                |.|

The problem is that this in turn generates an empty cronjob mail. This was not happening with previous versions.
Thanks
