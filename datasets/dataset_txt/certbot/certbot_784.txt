There was some concern from @joohoi about whether or not we currently handle this correctly in any/all of our DNS plugins. @joohoi, if you could add some additional context here that'd be great.
We should look into this issue soon as we're currently in the process of getting our DNS plugins packaged everywhere and we should try to avoid making distros immediately repackage them.
