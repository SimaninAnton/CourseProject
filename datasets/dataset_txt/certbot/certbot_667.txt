Per https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/wildcard-base-domain-two-txts-timeout-problem/56105/3, it's not obvious to users that a later DNS challenge isn't meant to replace an earlier DNS challenge. This makes sense because Certbot doesn't explicitly explain at what point the CA is going to validate the challenges; a user could easily assume that the CA validated the old challenge right away and that it's no longer needed. (In fact, Certbot could probably even have been implemented that way!)
So, the text in the manual authenticator should probably explicitly say something like "Don't remove, disable, or replace the earlier challenges yet" when telling the user to set up each new challenge for a subsequent name.
