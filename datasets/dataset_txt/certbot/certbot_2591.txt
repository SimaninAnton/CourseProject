Hello,
I have a problem when i try to use sudo permission. But When I use user permission, it's doing something but he don't create my domains certificates.
This is the message that it give me :
The directory '/home/[user]/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
The directory '/home/[user]/.cache/pip' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and caching wheels has been disabled. check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
Maybe I am doing it wrong.
