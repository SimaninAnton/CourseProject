As reported by @nils-ohlmeier, when you use the Apache plugin with the install verb, it defaults to installing the certificate to all found vhosts. This is true even if the certificate is only valid for a subset of these vhosts.
Apache should parse the certificate and only offer to install it for vhosts whose domain names are in the certificate or whose domain names are unknown.
