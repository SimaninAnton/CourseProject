Currently when performing manual authentication, you ask the user to create a file with a certain file name, and then reconfigure their webserver to serve that with Content-Type: text/plain. For example http://example.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/GUu94CoL-MRy4Lr4VpCLV4uG4kEqm4hDQ_9i8XMOixo
You could make it a lot easier by appending .txt to the challenge URL (filename), so no reconfiguration needs to take place.
