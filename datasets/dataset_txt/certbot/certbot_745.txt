I have some domains with certificates.
Now l want a script which could run only once pre hook (e.g. stop httpd, delete old certs). Then checks/renew all certs. After certbot has all done, then there should be run only one post hook (e.g. restart httpd, postfix, dovecot, copy files...)
Is that possible, perhaps with an example?
Mandy thanks.
My operating system is:
CentOS 7.4
