Currently the nginx plugin adds:
listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
It should add the following for IPv6 support:
listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
listen [::]:443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
An option for HTTP 2 would be nice too, either by specifying --http2 flag or just check nginx for compatibility.;
listen 443 ssl http2;
listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
