Hi,
I would use certbot with dns google plugin but in my environment is not possible.
I've a GCP project dedicated to a service (www.example.com) with a DNS zone (where I would to insert TXT record) that is different from any "progressively less-specific domain names" of FQDN. I've this setup because the domain of FQDN is managed by our provider and they have setup up a CNAME to GCP.
So in DNS provider there is the following record:
www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.google.example.com
And in GCP DNS there is "www.example.com.google.example.com" zone where I want to insert the TXT ACME record for www.example.com certificate.
With certbot-dns-google plugin this is not possible because it search for the following zones in GCP project: www.example.com, example.com and com
If I could pass the zone to change, this setup should works
Thanks
