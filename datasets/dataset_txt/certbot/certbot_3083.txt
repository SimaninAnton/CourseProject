@pavel-paulau, could you please remove the following package from PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3ab8c7d15dcda79f1a5cde4f39b06614/0.0.0.dev20151024. It's showing up, when querying for letsencrypt: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=letsencrypt&submit=search
Unfortunately, all other letsenncrypt-nginx-* packages, although already removed, are also visible in the results. Would you be able to talk to PyPI team to resolve this issue, @pavel-paulau?
