My operating system is Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache 2.4.7
I ran "certbot --apache" and answered the question "Please choose whether HTTPS access is required or optional" with "2: Secure - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access". Eight certificates were installed with this option.
What is the recommended command sequence or method to reset this option to "1: Easy - Allow both HTTP and HTTPS access to these sites."?
The 443 vhost file options-ssl-apache.conf now contains "SSLOptions +StrictRequire" ....
....and the "anyPort" vhost mydomain.conf file now contains "RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]".
Thanks
