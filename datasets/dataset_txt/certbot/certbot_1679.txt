In a few places in our code, we use print to bypass the line wrapping that IDisplay does. The problem with this is it requires us to duplicate code for things like -q/--quiet, making maintenance harder and increasing the chance for bugs.
Instead, we should either add an optional flag to the notification method to disable line wrapping or add a new method to IDisplay that doesn't format output.
