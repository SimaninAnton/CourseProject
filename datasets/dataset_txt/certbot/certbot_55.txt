One thing we will need soon is documentation for the Windows beta. Where do you download it from? How do you verify the download? What should you expect from the installer in terms of upgrades, automated renewal, etc.? How do you use Certbot once its installed? Where should I report feedback?
This can probably just be posted to Let's Encrypt's community forum for now once everythings ready, but these instructions need to be written at some point.
