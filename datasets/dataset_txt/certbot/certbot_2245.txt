Calling letsencrypt-auto fails with:
Checking for new version...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/tmp.FrWBbDP9Fu/fetch.py", line 20, in <module>
    from urllib2 import build_opener, HTTPHandler, HTTPSHandler, HTTPError
ImportError: cannot import name HTTPSHandler
If I call Python and issue the same import statement, I get no errors. How can I make sure which Python binary letsencrypt uses?
