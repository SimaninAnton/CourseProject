We have documentation in too many places. Let's clean up and deprecate them!
Ones we want to keep:
reStructuredText in this repo (and on readthedocs.org), in three main sections:
including the introduction (README.rst in the top level)
a using.rst "user guide" (is probably too redundant with the introduction...)
a contributing.rst "developer guide"
the instruction generator that lives in certbot/website
FAQs on the Certbot website.
Ones we want to get rid of:
the wiki on this repo
distinctly worded material at https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started
Ones that are in the middle:
docs that are on community.letsencrypt.org
