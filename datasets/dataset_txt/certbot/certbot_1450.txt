Parser fails when trying to parse the following map block:
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  '' close;
}
With error:
Cannot find a VirtualHost matching domain
By removing the map block the parsing is successfully. As a workaround (in nginx) I moved the WebSocket connection upgrade to a location block and removed the map block.
I'm running version 0.9.3 on Debian 8 (Jessy).
