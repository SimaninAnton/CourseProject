Hi,
the pre/post-hook seems to run always.
sometimes an option to "only run if somethings changed" would be nice:
current behaviour:
# ./certbot-auto renew --rsa-key-size 4096 --webroot --webroot-path /srv/www  --post-hook /root/bin/certbot-posthook
The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
... Posthook run here ...
any way to not run the hooks if renewal was not successful?
