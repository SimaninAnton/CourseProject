I am at commit cbb0e39
I went there looking for an explanation of how to simply generate a certificate while avoiding having this utility messing with my Apache config, which I would think would be the base case. After all, how many people run a web server and don't know how to configure (and want to maintain control of!!) their SSL configuration?
