If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 18 Server
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Certbot -- apache
I ran this command and it produced this output:

==> Assessment failed: Unable to connect to the server
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Didn't expect it to close off my ports.
Had to UFW allow 443 , 80, etc
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
