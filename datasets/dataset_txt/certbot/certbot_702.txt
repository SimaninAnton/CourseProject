My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 6.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto --no-bootstrap --no-self-upgrade
Creating virtual environment...
Cannot find any Pythons; please install one!
python --version
Python 2.6.5
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It says that python 2.6 is supported
If I go into the script and force the PYVER to 26, it still breaks:
virtualenv: command not found
