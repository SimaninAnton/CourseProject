after installing letsencrypt following the docs on my virtual machine:
Vagrant VM with NGINX
Python 2.7.6
Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
I get the following error after executing letsencrypt certonly:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/letsencrypt", line 9, in <module>

  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/acme/client.py", line 28, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'packages'
Is there something i'm missing? I'm quite noobish in this, would love to run letsencrypt!
