We want to slowly roll out the Nginx plugin to make sure it's working for people. To do this we should:
Mark the nginx plugin as hidden (we did this for the manual plugin)
Disable automatic selection if it's the only available configurator (if not already the case, we should disable automatic selection of hidden plugins).
Make sure the description of the Nginx plugin is sane (it used to say it was broken).
