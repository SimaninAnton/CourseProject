The latest release has the version number 0.0.0.dev20151008, which fails if checked on FreeBSD
with portlint -AC:
FATAL: Makefile: PORTVERSION looks illegal. You should modify "0.0.0.dev20151008".
I learned there's a name for a numeric scheme called 'semantic versioning', see
http://semver.org/
Would it be possible to adapt this or a similar scheme ?
