See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/conditional-builds-stages-jobs. Could we just add conditional jobs that check if: type = cron (whose availability is specified in https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/conditions-v1#integration) and set up master to always run nightly? I don't see why this wouldn't work.
