On AWS micro-instance running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I ran following command
sudo service nginx stop
./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server \
https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
And after Adding domain name I get following Error,
An unexpected error occurred:
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
ubuntu@ip-************:~/letsencrypt$ 
I can't even access letsencrypt log file. I get following error.
ubuntu@ip-***********:/var/log$ cd letsencrypt/
-bash: cd: letsencrypt/: Permission denied
ubuntu@ip-***********:/var/log$ 
P.S. I did once ended command prematurely with CTRL+C and after that I started receiving this error.
