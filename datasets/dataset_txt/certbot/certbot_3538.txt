Suppose the following events occur:
On Tuesday the user runs letsencyrpt on all her domains (perhaps she has 5)
On Wednesday she adds a new vhost
On Thursday she runs letsencrypt on all her names again (now she has 6)
Step 3 above shouldn't create a second certificate lineage which is renewed along with the first; by default it should create a successor to the first. There can be a command line flag (perhaps --duplicate) to actually create a second, if that's what you really want.
Now suppose this case:
On Tuesday the user runs letsencrypt --vhost sni to make 5 certs
On Wednesday she adds a new vhost
On Thursday she runs letsencrypt --vhost sni again to make 6 certs
The second command should either not make new certs for the 5 existing ones, or should make successors in their lineages, unless --duplicate is present.
