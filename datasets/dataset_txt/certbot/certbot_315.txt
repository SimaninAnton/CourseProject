This would allow us to catch problems with the latest versions of our dependencies such as unexpected API breakage.
I think this could be done either by configuring tox to not use our install scripts for these tests or by setting an environment variable or flag that skips the normal pinning in our scripts.
I think this should just be done in the test-everything branch so failures here don't block all development.
