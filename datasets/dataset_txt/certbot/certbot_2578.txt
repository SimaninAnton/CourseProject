I have an https server running and wanted to use the webroot auth method. It seams like no attempt to connect to port 443 with https is being made. Is this correct if so will it change in the future? I cannot serve anything other than https on port 443 since all other ports are firewalled and 443 is a productive server which cannot be replaced by a http server.
