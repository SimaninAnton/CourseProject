I have a situation where I run a test site with an expired, invalid certificate (worse, on HSTS).
Hence a command like this fails during verfication:
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /etc/ssl/something/staging -d staging.something.io
with
Failed authorization procedure. staging.something.io (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to staging.something.io
I assume a curl-like command is run. If so, needs the -v option to ignore existing insecure certificates.
