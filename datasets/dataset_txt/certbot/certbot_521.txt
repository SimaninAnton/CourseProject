At PyCon, one of the cryptography/pyopenssl maintainers switched some code around in certbot.crypto_util.verify_renewable_cert_sig to use cryptography rather than pyopenssl to try and work around some segfaults on some obscure systems. He told me at PyCon the methods he was using because of our need to support ancient versions were triggering deprecation warnings, but we didn't need to worry about them ripping it out anytime soon.
I didn't think anything of it because deprecation warnings aren't usually shown to users, but cryptography use their custom warning type which are shown. We haven't been seeing this because they don't show up in our pinned versions, but you can see it by upgrading cryptography in the venv and running certbot certificates.
We should use the warnings module to ignore these warnings during the duration of the method.
