Unable to do the email verification (that does the MX record lookup). Or certificate generation (that does the A record lookup).
Both fail.
The server in question is:
Hosted by Dyn Inc (one of the larges DNS providers).
Setup and functioning normally, and has been for a long time.
Using DNSSEC, which is configured and working normally.
The command is:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone --register-unsafely-without-email -d example.co.uk -d www.example.co.uk --agree-tos
Doing a dig a example.co.uk (using Google Public DNS as the servers resolver), the IP is returned as expected, so the DNS appears to be working correctly. Also, since Google Public DNS supports DNSSEC, the successful resolution indicates that it isn't a DNSSEC issue).
I'm running the command from a Debian 8.3 box, fresh brand new instance on Digital Ocean. The IP for the box is also the domains IP.
Same issue on Fedora 23 when installed by the package manager. On a different server, also on Digital Ocean. Again, a manual dig reveals the IP without issue.
