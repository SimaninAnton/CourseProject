My crontab contains:
30 2 * * 1 /opt/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto renew >> /var/log/le-renew.log
As recommended by this article: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04
This seems like a better option than simply suppressing output using --quiet, but it does have one problem, there is no timestamp in the log files. Is it reasonable to request that a timestamp be included in the output?
