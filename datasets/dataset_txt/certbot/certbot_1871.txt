I've created a certificate using
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /www/foobar/ -d foo.com -d bar.com
and later I wanted to remove the second domain, so I ran:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /www/foobar/ -d foo.com 
and I've got error
archive directory exists for foo.com
That is unhelpful. I know I can "fix" it by rm -rf /etc/letsencrypt, but I'd prefer that it wasn't an error at all.
IMHO certbot should just overwrite the certificate. If overwriting is considered too risky, then it should ask whether it's OK to overwrite, and/or the message should suggest a flag such as --force.
I'm running d05f53b on Debian 8.5
