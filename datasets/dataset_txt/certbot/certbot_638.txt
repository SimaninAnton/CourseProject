If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Apt-GEt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --nginx --dry-run --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
and I got this reply
--server value conflicts with --dry-run
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Should have runned dry-run
