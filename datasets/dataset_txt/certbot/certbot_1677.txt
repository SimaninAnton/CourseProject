Running on RHEL6 (which cannot easily use Python 2.7) this warning message is displayed each time I run the program:
/home/foo/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:26: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python. A future version of cryptography will drop support for Python 2.6
  DeprecationWarning
This could be easily fixed by changing the shebang in ~/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt to the following:
#!/home/foo/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2 -W ignore::DeprecationWarning
Edit @adferrand: The deprecation warning came back, for python 2.7 from pip execution, since the automated updates of pip in virtualenvs used by certbot-auto.
