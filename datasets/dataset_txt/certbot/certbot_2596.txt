Hi,
I'm trying to run the auto script after cloning letsencrypt to a new folder and here's what happens (All commands are executed by root):
./letsencrypt-auto --help
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --help
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: No module named urllib3
Verifying that python has urllib3 in both python2.* and 3.*:
python
Python 2.7.11 (default, Dec 15 2015, 16:46:19) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import urllib3
>>>
python3
Python 3.4.3 (default, Oct 14 2015, 20:28:29)

>>> import urllib3

Any suggestions/ideas are appreciated.
