The NGINX config file: certbot/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/options-ssl-nginx.conf
contains the following line:
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
this needs to be changed to:
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
The TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols are a major security risk, and the certbot config for NGINX should not be turning the on.
