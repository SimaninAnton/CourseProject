I thought the certificates should be updated when letsencrypt is run with the same command line again. But currently I'm experiencing the following:
~/letsencrypt # ./letsencrypt-auto --config /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini -d <DOMAIN> certonly
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --config /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini -d <DOMAIN> certonly

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/<DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2016-03-14. To obtain a new version of the certificate in
   the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.

After the second run the certificates are not updated but a new folder -0001 is created. If I run it a third time -0002 is created and so on.
I have checked out the current master af68109.
