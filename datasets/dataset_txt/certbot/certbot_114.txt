I visited https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuother-other and found that
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
in step 3 does not work, but
sudo certbot-auto certonly --standalone
does.
Which makes sense because that's the executable filename used in step 2:
sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
