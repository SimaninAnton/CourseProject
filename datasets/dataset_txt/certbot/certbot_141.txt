If I apply for multiple domain name certificates, such as example.com and *.example.com, the DNS authentication method, the record value of _acme-challenge.example.com will be added twice different values, resulting in authentication failure. Excuse me. How should I solve the problem?
Parameters -d *.example.com -d example.com
