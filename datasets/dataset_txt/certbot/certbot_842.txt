My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 6.9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto, pip
I ran this command and it produced this output:
[root@app01 ~]# ./certbot-auto --apache --no-bootstrap
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/letsencrypt:

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Didn't get a certification.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Didn't create log under /var/log/letsencrypt
