I tried to use letsencrypt-auto in order to renew the certificates but it seems that the new certificates are generated in a new directory /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>-0001 and I do not want this, I just want to replace the old certificate with the current one and to reload them after this.
I don't want to have to change the nginx configuration path each time I run letsencrypt-auto, probably from inside a cron job.
