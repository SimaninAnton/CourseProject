The documentation at https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#id5 says:
Throughout the documentation, whenever you see references to letsencrypt script/binary, you can substitute in letsencrypt-auto. For example, to get the help you would type:
That seems to imply that ./letsencrypt and ./letsencrypt-auto are equivalent. In fact they are not.
I observe that ./letsencrypt-auto is a useful executable script.
It is not a script/binary. It is just a script.
./letsencrypt is neither a script nor a binary. It's a directory.
Specific suggestions:
Main point: The documentation should be changed to eliminate references to ./letsencrypt in places where ./letsencrypt-auto is needed.
Minor point: documentation shouldn't say script/binary. Perhaps the intent was to say "executable script".
