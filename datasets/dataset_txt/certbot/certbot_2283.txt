If the standalone plugin were to allow users to specify which port to bind to (such as 8080), then it could be run as-needed for certonly behavior behind nginx/apache/ or any other server via a proxypass directive.
all challenges should would still be routed through port 80 (and 443 if needed). this would just afford the person who owns root privileges some flexibility as to how they route traffic.
