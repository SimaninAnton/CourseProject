Hi im using the letsencrypt for one of the sites, actually the site is based on the integration that receive the notification and show as a message, im integrating my site with Amazon SNS where it will send some notification and my site will receive it and show as a message. Here problem is Amazon SNS is sending notification but no message shown in the site, i checked it ans ssl handshake is going wrong.
