After updateing ubuntu my nginx proxy_pass is not working. With below configuration it worked over a 8 months but after ubuntu update to 18.04.2 the proxy_pass is not working.
my certbot nginx version is: nginx/1.15.10
Also I found there is 2 enteris in my etc/host has a 2 lines like
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 my_site.com
How to configure or what should I make so, my proxy_pass work again?
should Iremove and install certbot nginx again?
where I can find certbot nginx with letencrypt installation documantation?
Is new certbot nginx instalation uses new stable of nginx (currently stable nginx is 1.16 somting)?
