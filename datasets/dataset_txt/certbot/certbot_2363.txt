I am running into an issue with executing 'letsencrypt-auto' on the GCE Bitnami Ghost image.
The issue can be reproduced using the base installer below:
https://cloud.google.com/launcher/solution/bitnami-launchpad/ghost
Here is the command I use, and it's output:
sudo wget https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/archive/master.zip
sudo unzip master.zip
cd letsencrypt
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
sudo ./letsencrypt-auto --debug

Cannot locate wrapped file
Dependencies were all installed without issue. I have tried from both the 'home' directory and the root of the drive.
I have also tried:
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d {domain}
./letsencrypt-auto certonly -w /home/bitnami/htdocs -d {domain}
Any ideas what could be causing the wrapped file issue?
