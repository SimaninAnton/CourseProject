Out of the sudden, I got an error after trying to renew my certificates. One certificate is failing to renew. Here's the log in /var/log/letsencrypt/:
2017-01-31 20:59:54,078:WARNING:certbot.renewal:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.mydomain.com.conf produced an unexpected error: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). Skipping.

Let me know if you require more info.
