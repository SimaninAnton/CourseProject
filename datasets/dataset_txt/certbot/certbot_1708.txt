Hi,
I run the certbot on my working station which will then upload the certificate files to amazon s3 for which my servers have a proxy for /.well-known/*
I was experimenting with the hooks but none of them seem to be in between where the files are generated to webroot and when the testing of accessing those files are.
Not really sure how to handle this kind of scenario I looked into plugins but I believe the s3 plugin I was able to find is for bucket hosted websites, which is not the case for me.
I just want to be able to run any arbitrary shell command when the acme-challenge files are created but not yet tested to be reached.
I did workaround the issue by modifying auth_handler.py but I wonder if maybe here would be a good place for a hook or maybe some other approach in the documentation to handle the scenario where I want to create the files and then do something before validation.
I hope I did not miss something obvious in the documentation. Been reading about command line arguments for hours.
Thank you!
