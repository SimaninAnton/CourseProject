My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu WordPress 4.9.1 on 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot --authenticator standalone --installer apache --pre-hook "systemctl stop apache2" --post-hook "systemctl start apache2"
