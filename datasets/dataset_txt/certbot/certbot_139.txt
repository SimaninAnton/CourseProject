If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
CentOS6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo ./certbot-auto
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I dont have Python3.4 installed but I do have Python3.6. running certbot gave error of missing pkg_resources.
After reverting back to Python3.4 and using older setuptools, it worked fine.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
I renamed /opt/eff.org because earlier certbot-auto ran with Python3.4 which was in my system. Later I upgrade it to Python3.6 which removed Python3.4
$ sudo ./certbot-auto
