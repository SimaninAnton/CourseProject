Hi,
So I want to be-able to just execute a command line to generate a certificate without having to agree to multiple terms as this can't be automated. Of course I'm more than happy to set that I agree globally to such terms in a config file.
I just want this to work easily within the PHP shell execution function and without having to manually agree to the terms each time, it can be done easily.
Is there anyway of doing this via commandline?
Thank-you.
