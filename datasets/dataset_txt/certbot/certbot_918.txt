It kinda helps me to read my nginx configuration if certbot uses the same indentation level. For example, I typically use a 2 space indentation level and certbox comes along and smashes it with 4 spaces ;). I propose to add a --indent=<INT> flag so that we can set this from the CLI. As far as I can see, this isn't available? Will submit a PR if we're agreed.
