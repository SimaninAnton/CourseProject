With the new and improved ErrorHandler, SignalExit exceptions can propogate to the user if the ErrorHandler fails. In the message of this exception, we should tell the user how to rollback their config.
Couple of things to be mindful of here:
The current instructions for rolling back changes is awkward due to temporary checkpoints. See #3304.
It's possible there are no unwanted changes to the users config. The error message should tell the user to check first before rolling back (perhaps by using certbot config_changes?)
