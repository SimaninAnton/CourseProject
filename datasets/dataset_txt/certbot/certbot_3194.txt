At the moment, we tweak ciphersuites during install but not afterwards. Arguably the renewal script, when it runs on a daily basis, should check for changes to best practices and auto deploy them.
Users should be able to control several aspects of this:
Do they get ciphersuites optimised for compatibility, for security, a tradeoff betewen those, or in accordance with a specific project's recommendations (Mozilla/Bulletproof TLS/etc)
Do they get other security features optimised for compatibility, for security, or a tradeoff?
Are changes to these things automatically applied after a client update, or only at manual sys admin request?
I believe the default for each of these things should be tradeoff, tradeoff, and automatic. And those defaults should be documented.
