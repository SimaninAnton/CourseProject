We have hard coded that the dialog window be 24 characters tall and 72 characters wide in letsencrypt/display/util.py. If the terminal is smaller than that, dialog raises an exception. This exception may be unnecessary because the requested dialog widget may fit in a terminal smaller than 24 x 72.
dialog has the ability to autosize widgets which we might want to use. If we take this route, we should do the following:
Make sure this works on all system with both new and old version of dialog.
Make sure we're happy with how the autosized widgets look.
