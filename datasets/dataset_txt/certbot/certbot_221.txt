I ran this command and it produced this output:
The command certbot --help only lists the register and update_account
commands.
manage your account with Let's Encrypt:
    register        Create a Let's Encrypt ACME account
    update_account  Update a Let's Encrypt ACME account
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The help command should list the unregister under manage account.
Additionally it is not completely clear from the --help output that a more complete help is available with --help all, which does list the unregister.
