cli.py errors out if given --fullchain-path and --key-path without --cert-path:
sudo venv/bin/letsencrypt install  --key-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/isnot.org/privkey.pem --fullchain-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/isnot.org/fullchain.pem --hsts --uir --redirect --apache -d isnot.org,is.isnot.org

  certonly             Obtain cert, but do not install it (aka "auth")
  install              Install a previously obtained cert in a server
  revoke               Revoke a previously obtained certificate
  rollback             Rollback server configuration changes made during install
  config_changes       Show changes made to server config during installation
  plugins              Display information about installed plugins
