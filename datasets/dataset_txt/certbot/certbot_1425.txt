Hello,
I have an Apache installation on Ubuntu Trusty with a previous certificate made with openssl. That worked fine. Because there are now a few websites on the host, I did tried to remove openssl and installed certbot, but can't obtain an vaild certificate with certbot --apache.
I did restarted apache services, the command certbot --apache ends up with
this error message, repeating for each domain (virtual host) on this IP.
Detail: Incorrect validation certificate for TLS-SNI-01 challenge.
Requested
[123#.123#].acme.invalid from [IP Number]:443. Received 1 certificate(s), first
certificate had names "[domain.name]"
I've searched the web for this Error message, to find someone with same problem, but with no luck.
If anyone has an Idea on how to fix without reinstall from scratch, it would be a great help for me.
Meanwhile my search will go on, and of course I'll leave my solution here if I find one by myself.
