Due to what appears to be a bug in Docker affecting either newer versions of Docker or perhaps related to certain storage configurations, the letsencrypt Dockerfile fails to build.
It fails due to an attempt to copy the ubuntu.sh symlink into a directory in the container image.
This is a problem that should be fixed upstream by Docker, but a simple workaround is to just specify the full destination filename. Pull request incoming.
