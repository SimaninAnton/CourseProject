There is no rush to do this. I verified for #2639 that letsencrypt-auto will still receive updates after the repo rename. Changing the URL in letsencrypt-auto should only be done for aesthetic.
If we don't rename the repo until shortly before the rename, I believe we should wait to do this until 0.7.0 to avoid making last minute changes.
