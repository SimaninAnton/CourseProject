I tried running the client as non-root by mistake and it failed with
An unexpected error occurred: IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log' Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
Maybe it could say something more useful about needing to be run as root in this case.
