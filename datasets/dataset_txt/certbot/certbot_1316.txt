If you have more than one page full of output from the config_changes subcommand, you will get the last page listed with a weird "Press Enter to Continue" prompt.
Probably what that command should do if stdout is a terminal is invoke $PAGER to list the changes, in the same way that git log does. But failing that it should just output the stream of data so the user can pipe it to their preferred pager.
