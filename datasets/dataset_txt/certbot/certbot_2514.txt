as seen in #2228 we are having some errors where directives are added and then lost before saving due to aug.match being called. One place where aug.match is called is in configurator.find_dir()
This is pretty unexpected behavior, and will likely cause problems down the line. It would be nice if before aug.match is called we check to see if there are unsaved changes and save them.
I've also opened an issue with python-augeas about this behavior: hercules-team/python-augeas#15
