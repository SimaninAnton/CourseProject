Steps to reproduce:
Set up certbot development environment.
Make sure neither Nginx nor Apache is installed.
Run certbot --config-dir /tmp --logs-dir /tmp --work-dir /tmp --staging
Expected result: Error about no installer plugins (#3504).
Actual result: Error about installer plugins is printed in text at the bottom of the screen. A different error message is left in the dialog window above it. See screenshot.
