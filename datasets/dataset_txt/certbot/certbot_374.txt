#6370 is going to warn --manual users not to undo one challenge when setting up another one. This warning is probably necessary to avoid confusion, but @joohoi suggests that it might be even clearer and easier for the users if the manual authenticator could simply present all of the challenge instructions in a single list, then state that all of the challenges must be ready before continuing.
