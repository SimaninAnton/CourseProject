There are some obscure problems possible when running certbot-auto with a very old version of pip. There might be other problems where certbot-auto calls various tools and libraries on the system that have an implicit minimum version that we don't explicitly check for.
So, we should go through all of certbot-auto and try to identify minimum required versions (perhaps of anything other than tools that are specified by POSIX or something?) and then, if possible, check for them and give a specific and useful error if the dependency isn't met.
