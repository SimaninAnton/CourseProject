In deploy_cert(domain, cert_path, key_path, chain_path=None) the cert_path does not lead to a file.
I am on debian unstable and the passed cert_path is:
/etc/letsencrypt/certs/cert-letsencrypt.pem
However that file does not exist.
ls /etc/letsencrypt/certs/:
0000_cert-letsencrypt.pem  0000_csr-letsencrypt.pem  0001_cert-letsencrypt.pem  0001_csr-letsencrypt.pem  0002_csr-letsencrypt.pem
The path to the private key seems correct.
