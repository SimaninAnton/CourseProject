Platform: FreeBSD, port py27-letsencrypt.
Running: letsencrypt-auto certonly --manual I got a full chain, but it starts with 'happy hacker fake CA'. Is it expected on 5th December 2015, or should this already start with a real cert? (Stale code in port?)
Fanky cli experience, step-by-step:
Manual mode presents a direction of what should be done to server on a domain to prove, and asks to press return when done
Upon pressing a return after some 20 minutes (in which time server is properly configured), a screen with color-in-cli appears showing something about error in validation, as a single line header.
A few seconds later, new line appear in cli (non-gui) style, saying that everything is OK, and pointing to places with certs.
Given that step 3 shows success, warning display at step 2 just "puts hair on fire"
