My operating system is (include version):
Debian 9.5
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
pip3
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot plugins
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* standalone
Description: Spin up a temporary webserver
Interfaces: IAuthenticator, IPlugin
Entry point: standalone = certbot.plugins.standalone:Authenticator

* webroot
Description: Place files in webroot directory
Interfaces: IAuthenticator, IPlugin
Entry point: webroot = certbot.plugins.webroot:Authenticator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I installed certbot-dns-digitalocean just before running certbot plugins.
I recently switched from Apache to Nginx for various reasons, thinking certbot would be smart enough to just keep renewing certificates, but apparently I was wrong. Suddenly I'm faced with all of my certificates expiring and cryptic error messages such as
All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem (failure)
Because certbot's fucked up my server config files in the past and I'm not letting it touch them ever again, I thought I could try making it use DNS authentication over DigitalOcean. So I installed the DO plugin, but certbot can't find it.
I'm utterly lost and the non-existent documentation isn't making this situation any better. Please help.
