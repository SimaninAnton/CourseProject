Hi,
I'm trying to expand a certificate with a new domain but it fails with the following message:
Error: urn:acme:error:malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Unable to update challenge :: Response does not complete challenge
The domains list:
git.epic.net,auxilium.epic.net,billings.epic.net,discourse.epic-sys.io,git.epic-sys.io,git.epic.net,registry.epic-sys.io,reports.epic.net,support.epic.net,track.epic.net,discourse.epic.net
It seems that discourse.epic.net makes the request fail, certbot and lego gives the same result.
Attached is the full log for the session. The domain resolves correctly, I'm not sure what to do.
