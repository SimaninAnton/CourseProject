On a fresh install of Apache on Debian, I used certbot to create the following vhost:
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
<VirtualHost *:443>
    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
    # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
    # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
    # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
    # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
    # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
    # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
    #ServerName www.example.com

    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
    # error, crit, alert, emerg.
    # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
    # modules, e.g.
    #LogLevel info ssl:warn

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
    # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
    # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
    # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
    # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
    #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/pickupapp.me/fullchain.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/pickupapp.me/privkey.pem
Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
ServerName example.com
</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
</IfModule>
I then deleted all vhosts listening on port 80 and made the vhost above the only enabled vhost. After that I ran certbot -d example.com --apache --redirect --reinstall.
When doing this, I saw the following message in the logs:
2016-06-08 10:31:19,919:INFO:certbot_apache.configurator:Created redirect file: le-redirect-example.com.conf
and although the vhost was created, it was not enabled.
