From http://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/:
Add the --check-untyped-defs option to your mypy arguments, and get that running with no errors on the codebase. This option causes mypy to check every def in the codebase for internal consistency; mypy can detect many classes of bugs and mistakes in your codebase, without your having written a single type annotation!
In most cases, you’ll want to fix bugs and bad code as you go, but you can also use #type: ignore annotations or exclude files to defer issues. For example, we excluded all of Zulip’s tests at first, since they’re both lower value to type-check and had most of the monkey-patching and other questionable Python in the project. For Zulip, getting clean --check-untyped-defs output took me about 2 days of hard work, including merging fixes for about 40 issues in the Zulip codebase.
I spent another day or two generating nice reproducers for the mypy bugs I’d encountered and improving typeshed. Now that mypy is no longer in its infancy, mypy bugs are increasingly rare. But a large project should expect to encounter and fix typeshed issues (just submit a PR!).
