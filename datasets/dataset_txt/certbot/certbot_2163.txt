To get a SSL security certificate on my machine, I have to download unsigned and untrusted code from a public web site maintained by an unknown number of arbitrary contributors, and then run this code on my servers.
Upon first-run, I'm greeted like this:-
[sudo] password for gitcnd:
... this code then reaches out without warning or permission to assorted internet servers and gets even more software from dubious sources (yes, on centos/redhat, RPM has a signature-checking "feature", however, for the last 4 or 5 years since I filed a bug report on that [missing signatures are silently accepted!] those maintainers have chosen not to let RPM have any means to reject an "install request" because that might "break something" - they won't fix the bug, and they won't add that feature either).
and who knows what happens next, because after many dozens of junk dependancies, something died and it all failed.
This suggests to me that nobody in the letsencrypt project takes actual security even slightly seriously.
