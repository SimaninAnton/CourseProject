Problem
I'm attempting to get a certificate for a new domain with a following format:
wkoszek_nc2.x.mycompany.com
However the client seems to get confused about _. Upon removing the _ from the domain name, it works fine. For example, this works OK:
wkoszeknc2.x.mycompany.com
To reproduce the problem:
Use this command to reproduce:
# ./certbot-auto certonly --standalone --email wkoszek@mycompany.com -d wkoszek_nc2.x.mycompany.com
I'm getting this:
Checking for new version...
Requesting root privileges to run certbot...
   /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly --standalone --email wkoszek@mycompany.com -d wkoszek_nc2.x.mycompany.com
Requested domain wkoszek_nc2.x.mycompany.com is not a FQDN
