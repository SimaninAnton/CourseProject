In a number of places, we store authorizations as a mapping from domains to its authorization. This is a problem because when requesting a single certificate for *.example.org and example.org, boulder returns an order with two authorizations for example.org. The authorization for the wildcard includes wildcard: true in the authz, but this doesn't seem to be in the ACME spec.
I'm sure we can find a way around it, but @jsha, is there anything I'm missing in the spec that we can rely on to map authzs back to their domains for an arbitrary ACMEv2-style server?
