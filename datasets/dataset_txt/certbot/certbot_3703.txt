Hello,
I don't know if this is the right place for this kind of question, but will Plesk be supported?
As you say only lets-encrypt example.com is needed for generating and activating an SSL certificate for this domain I wonder if this works with Plesk's certificate management.
In Plesk you have to add a ca-certificate and your own certificate to a domain/subdomain to get it activated.
Kind regards,
Stefan
