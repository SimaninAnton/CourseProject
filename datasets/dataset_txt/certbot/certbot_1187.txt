As reported at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/the-error-was-pluginerror-there-has-been-an-error-in-parsing-the-file/33792, Certbot currently errors out when parsing the following snippet of an Apache configuration file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteMap symlinks prg:/var/www/redirector.pl
RewriteCond ${symlinks:%{HTTP_HOST}} !=""
RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://${symlinks:%{HTTP_HOST}}/$1 [R=301,L]
The line causing the problem is:
RewriteCond ${symlinks:%{HTTP_HOST}} !=""
Apache doesn't have a problem with this syntax.
