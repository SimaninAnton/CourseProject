If python isn't in your PATH (but is findable by the Certbot executable because it has its own version of Python), the tests fail very late with a confusing error message as seen at https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2vjtPksBtH/.
We should add a simple check to this at the top of tests/boulder-integration.sh.
