When this goes live, where will the intermediate certificates be located?
Searching the docs for chain.pem yields no results.
I just [asked on the mailing list](See https://groups.google.com/a/letsencrypt.org/forum/#!topic/client-dev/jE5uK4lPx5g), but it seems it should be an issue on here as well.
Currently we have these files:
privkey.pem
cert.pem
chain.pem
fullchain.pem
But we don't know what goes in them. With the current dummy certificate it puts the Root CA in the chain.pem (which seems wrong) and fullchain.pem and that the Server Certificate goes into cert.pem and fullchain.pem, but we don't know where the Intermediate Certificates go.
This is extremely important because some webservers are lax, others are strict, others barf if you give too much info, others silently fail if you give to little.
I've already written some documentation and demo code based on assumption, but I already know that that's going to blow up in my face if I don't get the details correct.
In order for greatest compatibility with various servers it would seem that we need a file that bundles the server + intermediate certificates, and excludes the root certificate. I'm hoping that's what cert.pem is intended to be.
Once I know the technical details as to what these files are supposed to represent, I may open another issue to discuss the need for additional files.
