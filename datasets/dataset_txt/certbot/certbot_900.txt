letsencrypt.log
My operating system is (include version):
stable Gentoo linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Gentoo package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/usr/bin/certbot renew --max-log-backups 5 --standalone --non-interactive --text
The cert if for my jabber server, therefore I have a script which runs
/usr/bin/certbot renew --max-log-backups 5 --standalone --non-interactive --text
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber.zwiebeltoralf.de/{privkey,fullchain}.pem > $pem
after rboot
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
times out immediately in reboot if called from script, works fine if running at the command line
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
