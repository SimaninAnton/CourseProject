On my server I had all my sites configured with nginx. After installing certbot via apt-get and doing some configurations for nginx, I restarted server and after that, all my sites were down.
This because, without my knowledge, an apache2 was up running, blocking the port and thus preventing nginx from starting up. Boom.
Tried to remove apache2 only:

Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.

After this operation, 751 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
But no, it would uninstall everything else including certbot. Don't want to uninstall certbox when uninstalling apache2.
Is there no way to install certbot without apache2?
