Hello, When i try to renew cert using certbot renew --dry-run i got following error:
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
but the renew is success, just curious why i got that error. is there something application that i need to install?
Thank You
