We should probably be regularly testing against Ubuntu 19.04 when it comes out.
In April, Ubuntu 14.04 will be end-of-lifed so we can remove our AMIs for that release as well.
Erica and I had different opinions about whether we should keep the Ubuntu 18.10 tests when tests for 19.04 are added at #6700 (review).
