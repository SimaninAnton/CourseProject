If you search for Let's Encrypt from GitHub's search, this project doesn't appear - only the various clients that interface with Let's Encrypt.
If you care to fix it, it would be an easy fix, simply change the repository description from:
"An ACME client that can obtain certs and extensibly update server configurations (currently supports Apache on .deb based systems, nginx support coming soon)"
to "Let's Encrypt is an ACME client that can obtain certs and extensibly update server configurations (currently supports Apache on .deb based systems, nginx support coming soon)"
Either way, I thought I'd give you guys a heads up!
