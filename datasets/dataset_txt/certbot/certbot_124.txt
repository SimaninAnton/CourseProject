Our CI is broken because Python 3.4 is currently broken for Debian 8. This issue has been reported upstream and fixed few hours ago: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931044
This bug makes the installation of python3.4 package of Debian 8 fail during the debconf invocation:
Setting up python3.4 (3.4.2-1+deb8u3) ...
  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py", line 1014
    raise InvalidURL(f"URL can't contain control characters. {url!r} "
                                                                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
dpkg: error processing package python3.4 (--configure):
 subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
As a consequence, apache_compat, nginx_compat and le_auto_jessie are broken.
Some users may also encountered the issue when installing certbot on Jessie using certbot-auto or debian packages.
Hopefully the issue will be resolved without manual intervention once the new packages are published to Debian repo.
