Hi! I'd like to help out if I can. I saw on twitter that you'd like folks to write tests for boulder, but I don't know Go and would rather help out where I can immediately. Where might an experienced Python programmer best help?
I saw the contributing doc and will be going through the steps there. Should I then just start picking off posted issues and submitting PRs?
