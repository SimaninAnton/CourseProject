We've had some apache tickets (eg #998 #1354 #1243) which imply that the plugin's revert-in-case-of-error mechanisms are imperfect. Those completely block the release of the Apache plugin. We need to perform an audit to ensure that the all of the Apache plugin's file writing operations, module enablement/disablement, and config editing are properly wrapped in proper reversion logic and try-except blocks that ensure reversion is attempted after any failure.
