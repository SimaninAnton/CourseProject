The renewer will probably normally run from /etc/cron.daily on most systems, and there is a config file option to inhibit this from doing anything. But if the renewer is run manually, it should probably be able to perform renewals and ignore that option (thus distinguishing "automated renewal" from "manual renewal").
One option for this is just to look at sys.argv[0] to see what name the renewer was run under, and tell packagers to call the symlink in /etc/cron.daily something other than the name of the manual renewer script.
