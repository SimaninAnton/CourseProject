It turns out we're not building our wheels for PyPI correctly. Due to the way we're adding conditional dependencies, the dependencies that get added to the wheel are only those that were required on the system that built the wheel. For example, all of our setup.py files contains code like this:
if sys.version_info < (2, 7): 
    install_requires.extend([
        'argparse',
        'mock<1.1.0',
    ])  
else:
    install_requires.append('mock')
We have always built our wheels on Python 2.7, however, which means our wheels will never install argparse or mock<1.1.0. This problem doesn't affect certbot-auto, but affects people installing through pip.
Fixing this problem without breaking people on old versions of setuptools/pip will be tricky (or impossible).
