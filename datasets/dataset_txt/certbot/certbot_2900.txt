I'm on Ubuntu 14.04.
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -c cli.ini -d heimkoma.com gives the following error:
I'm having to create this on a separate server that doesn't have the SSL virtualhost for heimkoma.com
Failed authorization procedure. heimkoma.com (tls-sni-01): unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Correct zName not found for TLS SNI challenge

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following 'unauthorized' errors were reported by the server:

   Domains: heimkoma.com
   Error: The client lacks sufficient authorization

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
cli.ini contains the following:
