My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.5
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot-auto --apache
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
can not install
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Installing Python packages...
Had a problem while installing Python packages.
pip prints the following errors:
