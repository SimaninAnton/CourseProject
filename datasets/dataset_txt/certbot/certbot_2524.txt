Users have reported seeing errors like the following:
Cannot find a cert or key directive in
/files/etc/apache2/sites-available/ssl.conf/virtualhost.
This is an Augeas path and I think it is as likely to confuse users as it is to help them. This and any similar output should be changed to show the actual file path.
