It would be nice to have an ability to change the port in manual mode.
I'm using nginx with rather complex config and don't want let's encrypt client to modify it. I'm interested in nginx as a reverse proxy for the client:
location ~ ^/(.well-known/acme-challenge/.*)$ {
proxy_pass http://192.168.10.104/$1;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
Now I use docker container but would like to use it native without interference with nginx running at port 80.
From outside it'll be still at port 80 so server-side does not need any changes for that.
