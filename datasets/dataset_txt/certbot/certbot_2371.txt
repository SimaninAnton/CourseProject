I tried to use the new renew subcommand, but it first failed with #2468, which I fixed by manually replacing the port, and then with the following error message:
2016-02-24 19:23:18,395:WARNING:letsencrypt.cli:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/[redacted].conf produced an unexpected error: The webroot plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError('t does not exist or is not a directory',). Skipping.
All certificates produced exactly the same error. I looked through the code and it appears it's failing to find the correct webroot path. The path is correct in the config file LE uses to renew the certificate.
