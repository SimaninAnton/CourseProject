My operating system is (include version):
Linux ook 4.9.36-x86_64-linode85 #1 SMP Thu Jul 6 15:31:23 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Via then official Ubuntu PPA.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
N.A.
What the problem isâ€¦
When running apt-get update, I get the following warning:
W: Ignoring Provides line with DepCompareOp for package python-cffi-backend-api-max

W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
Running pat-get update again does nothing whatsoever. It appears that python-cffi-backend is a dependency of certbot. However, it breaks apt on 14.04.
Is there any solutions for this?
