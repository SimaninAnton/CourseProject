md5 is an artifact from days long gone - so much so that it isn't supported at all by web crypto.
I'm working on a node.js (and browser) clone of letsencrypt that works on all platforms - including OS X and Windows (complete) and the browser (incomplete) and I don't know what every possible security consideration of an account id might be, but I'd like to stay 100% compatible and I'd also rather be safe than sorry.
