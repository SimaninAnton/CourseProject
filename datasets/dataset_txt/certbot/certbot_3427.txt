You ask for a path instead of a file, when a folder is given, you 'accept' that as the path, and then nothing works.
You need to specifically ask for the files (e.g. rename to --cert_file and --key_file), then check if what you received are valid files or folders instead. If the check fails, give a meaningful error message ("You only gave the folder, please give the file").
