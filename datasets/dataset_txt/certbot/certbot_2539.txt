First I read this:
http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#installation
and then I ran this on my Mac dev machine:
./letsencrypt-auto
which told me to run this:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly
which resulted in this error:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: mydomain.com
   Type:   urn:acme:error:tls
   Detail: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge
After further reading, I'm guessing it's because I'm not running the command on mydomain.com?
I think the ideal UX would be:
When ./letsencrypt-auto is run, ask user whether they are on the server they want a cert for.
If yes, continue
If no, say "This process is much easier if you run this command on the server you want a cert for. Can you run this command on that server?"
If yes, print installation options â€“ git clone or yum/apt/etc install letsencrypt , then exit
If no, start the manual process
