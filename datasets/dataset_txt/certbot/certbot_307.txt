I just ran tox tests locally for the first time in a while (as it's the first time I've written a significant PR in a while) and they were frustratingly slow. pytest-xdist which we already use for running our tests in parallel has the ability to push the code to a remote server and run tests there which could significantly speed up how long it takes to run tests locally. This functionality is described at https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist#sending-tests-to-remote-ssh-accounts.
I haven't deeply looked into this and there may be reasons it won't work or is a bad idea, but I think it's probably worth playing with.
EFF has some servers we could probably use for this. Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to give external developers access to these servers and any options specifically related to them probably shouldn't be merged into this repo, however, there may be some generic config/options/scripts that external developers could easily use to set this up themselves on their own servers.
