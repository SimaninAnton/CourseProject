I installed as described in the README on Ubuntu 14.04 and after starting letsencrypt from the venv, it shows the disclaimer and after I agree, it shows:
There has been an error in parsing the file: /etc/cups/printers.conf
Parse error: mismatched in square lens, expecting "DefaultPrinter"
but got "Printer"
No domain names were found in your installation
Either specify which names you would like letsencrypt to validate
or add server names to your virtual hosts
Why is it parsing my cups printers.conf???
(the rest is ok, I have no hostnames, apache2 was freshly installed on this machine)
