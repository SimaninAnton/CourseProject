A certbot certificates command produces for instance
"Certificate Name:" xxxx.org
"Domain:" aaaaa.com aaaaa.org bbbbb.com
The command certbot --cert-name can only be the name shown on CertificateName... It can't be a name of the Domain line, but this is the most frequent need of users!
To delete an item from the Domains list (eg. to delete bbbbb.com), user must to run certbot --cert-name xxxx.org -d aaaaa.com -d aaaaa.org and omitting from the -d list the item to be deleted, as remembered here... No news about it.
So the algorithm is very simple!
Domain exist and we can suppose that is an array.
the item to be deleted is supplyed as input, and can be removed from the Domain array.
the effect of certbot --cert-name command is well-known by user (replace the existing certificate by a new certificate containing only the domains specified by -d options).
... And it's very useful:
redo a list by hand is error-prone
a big list is very common, and so boring to redo, even by copy/paste.
not make sense the user redo it, if the command knows it!
