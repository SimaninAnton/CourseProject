If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
ppa:certbot/certbot
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
certbot.timer and certbot.service were missing in the certbot package from the PPA. These files are still present in Ubuntu universe.
systemd is still referenced in /etc/cron.d/certbot, so why are these files missing? Were they removed?
