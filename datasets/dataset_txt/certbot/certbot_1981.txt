Those doomed to deal with corporate proxies usually setup a local PyPi mirror that goes configured in "/etc/pip.conf".
Problem is certbot-auto creates a virtualenv that seems to ignore it. There is no way to add the file manually to virtualenv because certbot-auto recreates it everytime.
Could certbot-auto accept a parameter (say, "--pipconf") that could point to a pip.conf file that could be copied into the virtualenv it creates?
