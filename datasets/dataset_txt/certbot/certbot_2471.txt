Hello,
I just tried using letsencrypt via the git repo for REHL 5.11 with cPanel. Sadly, it was a complete failure. It spit out the following errors:
No package python-virtualenv available.
No package python-pip available.
No package augeas-libs available.
No package libffi-devel available.
No package ca-certificates available.
./letsencrypt-auto: line 104: [: too many arguments
./letsencrypt-auto: line 106: [: too many arguments
Looks like this was never intended for my environment. I'm in a VPS hosted server and I'm guessing a significant number of others will be in the same boat. Would love an easy way to do the webroot method as that's the one I'm planning to use.
