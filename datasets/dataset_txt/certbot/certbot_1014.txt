Hi,
I have an account at Strato.com (Germany).
I have an ssh account on their system, but it is different than all those documented.
My operating system is (include version):
SunOS gaffer 5.10 Generic_150401-49 i86pc i386 i86pc Solaris
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto --apache
./certbot-auto: syntax error at line 32: `BASENAME=$' unexpected
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It doesn't work
