I tried setting various workarounds and umask but nothing worked. I'm more than happy to do this myself, but I'm not really given the chance. Instead I left this running on the server:
while [ 1 ] ; do chmod -R o+rX ~/public_html ; sleep 0.01 ; done
Maybe the script should pause with the files created to give the user a chance to see what the problem is?
