Building crypto fails on OpenBSD 5.9 (LibreSSL 2.3.3) because openssl/e_os2.h doesn't exist anymore.
build/temp.openbsd-5.9-amd64-2.7/_openssl.c:423:27: error: openssl/e_os2.h: No such file or directory
It has been removed here: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/src/Attic/e_os2.h
