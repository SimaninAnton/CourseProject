Steps to reproduce:
Have a domain lastbart.at configured in Apache for HTTP but not HTTPS.
letsencrypt --text --agree-eula --agree-tos -d lastbart.at -a apache auth
Actual result:
File /etc/apache2/sites-available/lastbart.at-le-ssl.conf is created, has two lines pointing at non-existent files:
SSLCertificateFile insert_cert_file_path
SSLCertificateKeyFile insert_key_file_path
Expected result:
No config files are left behind after successful authentication.
