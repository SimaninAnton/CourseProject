The spec has added support for a meta section in the directory object which allows for a number of pieces of information that are not necessarily related to the ACME protocol. Currently the client will fail if these fields are returned which is causing letsencrypt/boulder#1692 to fail.
Also in general it would be good to be slightly less strict about JSON deserialization (i.e. ignoring unexpected fields) since we have other better ways of testing if the server/client start drifting out of sync.
