I'm trying to use "./letsencrypt-auto certonly" on Gentoo using webroot authenticator.
webroot-path is set to /tmp/letsencrypt-auto and i have a global alias in Apache.
Alias /.well-known/acme-challenge "/tmp/letsencrypt-auto"
<Directory "/tmp/letsencrypt-auto">
        Allow from all
        DefaultType text/plain
</Directory>
The problem is no file is created in /tmp/letsencrypt-auto
I'm using the same method on Ubuntu and it's working fine.
# ./letsencrypt-auto certonly -d www.domain.tld
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly -d www.domain.tld
Failed authorization procedure. www.domain.tld (http-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Invalid response from http://www.domain.tld/.well-known/acme-challenge/s4i7TepN2IAI6st-uBaN_F4AehoB93KemNzGQNBpHGg 404
Access to http://www.domain.tld/.well-known/acme-challenge works fine but since there wasn't any s4i7TepN2IAI6st-uBaN_F4AehoB93KemNzGQNBpHGg created, it fails.
