All sorts of things can go wrong in terms of the server being unable to connect to the client. For instance, the DNS for a name may not actually point at the server, or the server may be behind a NAT or otherwall, or the server may have a local firewall that blocks inbound :443 connections.
We should, at minimum, provide a sensible error report when this occurs.
