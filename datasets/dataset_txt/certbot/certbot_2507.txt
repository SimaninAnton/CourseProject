While trying to use letsencrypt for the first time on Debian Jessie I get an error.
Here is the error. http://pastebin.com/xCLASpbn
When i run apt-get install python2.7-dev I get this error. http://pastebin.com/QuDrPKxj
when I run apt-get install on the missing package it all boils down to a problem with libc6-dev.
When I try to apt-get install that i get this. http://pastebin.com/SrxRcXk4
Which means the libc6 on my system is to new for everything else... Any idea how to fix this?
