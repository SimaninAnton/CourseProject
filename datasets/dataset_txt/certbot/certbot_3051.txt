I am possibly missing something here.. But I would be nice to be able to fetch a cert on my local machine to current directory, without root. I would believe the run bellow only wants permission to put the cert in /etc/letsencrypt, right?
Running letsencrypt without root yeals this.
$ letsencrypt certonly --agree-dev-preview --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory -d mydomain.com
An unexpected error occurred.
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt'
Please see the logfile 'letsencrypt.log' for more details.
Don't know if it makes any difference, but I installed via https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/letsencrypt-git/
