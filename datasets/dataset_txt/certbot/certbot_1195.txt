My operating system is (include version):
Linux 4.4.0-75-generic #96-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 20 09:56:33 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto certonly --standalone --email myemail --expand -d softcraft.co,www.softcraft.co,hampi.softcraft.co,beta.softcraft.co,blog.softcraft.co
Firstly, I had this output:
Killed
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /home/second/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt: 
Killed
Then I did cd $HOME/.local/share && rm -fr letsencrypt
After that the same command produces next output:

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I would like to add new subdomain (blog.softcraft.co) to my sertificate and instead nothing happened.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
