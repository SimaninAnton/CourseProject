In #7167, I pinned the macOS image to the latest version to workaround https://travis-ci.community/t/xcode-8-3-homebrew-outdated-error/3798. I think there are pros to pinning this image in the long run as it could make the tests more stable, but I don't think it's worth it. We haven't had many problems due to using Travis' default here, I think it's easy to forget to update this pinning, and I think using a non-default value here makes our config more unusual and therefore more likely to hit bugs. I think #7167 should be reverted when the upstream issue is resolved.
