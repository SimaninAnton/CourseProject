When prompting a user for a path (e.g. when the key cannot be found in Proof of Possession), the user is currently given a simple text box. It would be better if we gave the user a dialog such as http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/widgets.html#file-or-directory-selection to help them find and type the desired path correctly.
