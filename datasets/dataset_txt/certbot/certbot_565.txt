I managed to run certbot from a docker image(installing locally had no chance due some python errors). However wildcard doesn't work. Why is that? I thought it's in production yet, isn't it ?
./certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d xxx.net -d *.xxx.net

The currently selected ACME CA endpoint does not support issuing wildcard certificates.
