I think it is unnecessary for the script to require root for running the script.
I could be preparing everything on a different machine from where the certs will actually be used (think puppet, chef, ansible ...etc)
I could be running the script where the configuration files actually are, e.g. on the master where the configuration will be kept or a git clone, or even some workspace that I gets rsync'd to the target machine.
Think of the difference between make and make install, usually I would prefer to do make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inspectme rather than blindly run a script as root.
