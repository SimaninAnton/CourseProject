When we used dialog, the user was sometimes able to select "Help" at a given prompt to get more information. This isn't possible anymore that dialog has been removed.
Often this help was just info on how to use dialog, but not always. The best use we had that I can think of off the top of my head is plugin selection to get more information about the selected plugin. We should come up with a way to add functionality like this to the text interface.
