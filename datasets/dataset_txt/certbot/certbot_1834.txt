hello, i want to make a small bug report:
i have written a script which turns off my httpd and extends my certificate. (i know there are other ways to do it but i have to do it like that because of other issues)
anyway this script contains the parameter --quiet since its an automated crontab. when i install my linux machine freshly however, i launch that cron manually for the first time and there comes the problem:
the first time, certbot-auto launches apt-get and wants to install some packages like python, which is fine.
with the --quiet parameter however the output is surpressed and the need for confirmation (do you wanna install following NEW packages?) is invisible. since i know the process from calling it without the --quiet parameter, i knew what to do blindly (write "y" and enter). and it worked flawlessly.
but is it possible to add the "-y" parameter for the apt-get installs in case certbot-auto was launched in "--quiet" mode? it makes even sense just from a logical standpoint since human interaction is surely not wanted in an automated process. and that is what --quiet was added for, no?
thank you for reading everybody.
