at 31c3, there was a question whether letsencrypt supports issuing short-lived certificates (one-time and also for frequent renewal). short-lived certs (if you can obtain/renew them quickly) might be a good alternative for revoking certs.
there seemed to be open policy questions about this and also this is not implemented yet in the client (and maybe also not in the server). could somebody comment / update on this?
