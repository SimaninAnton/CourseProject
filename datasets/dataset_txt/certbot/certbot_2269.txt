People still periodically get confused about this issue on the forums (and it's even conceivable that as many certificates are being revoked in a misguided attempt to reset rate limiting as for any other reason!); I think it would be helpful to go through everywhere that revoke is mentioned and add some text saying "This does not affect the rate limit" or "No effect on rate limits" or something along those lines.
