Hello,
I am packaging letsencrypt packages for Arch, and as a rolling release we are always following the latest letsencrypt releases. I understand that letsencrypt-auto is meant to be a script for installing into a virtualenv currently, but as more howtos and experience came out it's somewhat treated as the recommended setup now. So I would like to suggest to add the ability to use our system package manager to install letsencrypt packages (and even by default, if possible).
Thank you!
