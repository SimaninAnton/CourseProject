Hey there,
atm after revoke certs are still stored in /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN.TLD/ and /etc/letsencrypt/archives/.... I recommend adding a new parameter like --cleanup so after successful revokation not needed files will be removed automatically.
For single hosting such cleanup task is not needed, but think about big ISP, which for example also transfer domains to other servers... :)
