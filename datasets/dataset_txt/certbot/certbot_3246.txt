The client does not properly handle the case when --redirect is specified on the command line. The root of the problem is this argument is treated as a binary variable in cli.py (True or False) and a ternary variable in client.py (True, False, or None). The resulting behavior is if --redirect is not specified on the command line, client.py assumes the user does not want a redirect.
The simple fix is to prompt the user on whether or not they want a redirect if --redirect is not included on the command line. A better fix is to allow the user to specify whether or not they want a redirect on the command line and prompting them if nothing is specified.
