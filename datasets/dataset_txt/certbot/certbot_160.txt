My operating system is (include version):
Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get install certbot -t stretch-backports
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/certbot", line 7, in
from certbot.main import main
ImportError: No module named certbot.main
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
it shouldn't output this error
Python version in use :
Python 2.7.13
