We use certs a.o. to enhance privacy (making it harder to "snoop" our connections). But to ensure our privacy, it would be good to have some more transparency:
We're expected to run certbot-auto as root, and it then "will take care for the rest automatically". While this is nice and relaxing from the users' workload, I'd like to know in advance what gets installed where to. Some examples:
which directories will be created, and which files placed where?
will it install its "own stuff" just into the directory it's invoked from?
would it "mess up" things when run from /usr/local/bin (i.e. by installing a bunch of dependencies there)?
it looks like it always wants to install all its plugins, no matter what (e.g. I see no way to tell it I don't want/need the Apache plugin, so it doesn't need to install augeas). Is that so? The docs say nothing about it (or I've missed that).
Of course one could try to "reverse-engineer" those details from the certbot-auto script. But that's a) not feasible (considering many users do not have the technical background to do so) and b) should not be needed with an open-source program which is all about privacy and security.
TL;DR: Can we have at least a raw listing of what will be installed where to (raw e.g. in telling "Python modules go into /some/dir, without listing all their files) â€“ and a way to tell which plugins we (don't) want?
This shouldn't be a rant, just reasoning :) Wondering noone brought it up before (or did I miss that as well?)
Thanks in advance!
