Currently, the test suite produces many errors on run. Unfortunately, the names of some of the tests lead me to believe that some of the errors that it produces might be desirable. Because of this, I'm not sure which errors should be reported or acted on, and the test suite is of less usefulness.
An example test log is at https://blog.setec.io/.letsencrypt/testlog.txt
