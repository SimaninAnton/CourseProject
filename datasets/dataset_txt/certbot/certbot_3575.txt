My use-case might be special, still this might be useful for others as well: I use sslh to allow SSH, OpenVPN and HTTPS traffic on the same port. Thus, my Apache is NOT listening on 443 for SSL requests, but on a different port.
It seems that the letsencrypt client specifically checks for Port 443 when configuring Apache. Could there be an option to override this port in order to support this configuration? Unfortunately, I couldn't find any hint regarding this in neither the documentation nor the issues.
