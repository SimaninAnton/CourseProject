My operating system is (include version): ubuntu 16.0.4
I installed Certbot with python-certbot-apache
I ran this command and it produced this output: certbot --apache -d domain.com -d www.domain.com
Failed authorization procedure. domain.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Timeout, www.domain.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Timeout
IMPORTANT NOTES:
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain: jdesk9.com
Type: connection
Detail: Timeout
Domain: www.jdesk9.com
Type: connection
Detail: Timeout
To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
entered correctly and the DNS A/AAAA record(s) for that domain
contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.
Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
