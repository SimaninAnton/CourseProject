I was trying out a let's encrypt cert on a new server, and as part of my httpd configuration process I always run the server by this TLS scanner (link is to the report for my let's encrypt protected test server):
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=nief.org
It reports that the server would not work with Java 6 (not a cert issue, an httpd configuration issue), but it also says it will not work with Java 7 or 8 because "Client aborts on SNI unrecognized_name warning"... I am not familiar with this error, but I do not get this error reported for an identically configured httpd on a server with an InCommon cert. I have not tried to come up with any test code to try and ascertain what the implication of this error is, but I thought I would check to see if there are issues with Java clients.
Thanks.
