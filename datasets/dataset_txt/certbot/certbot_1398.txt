hello,
(I did not know were to ask,so I came here)
I found out there were no instruction to install certbot on ubuntu 12.04
does this meant it is not compatible ?
we have an old system and migration/upgrades are not possible becos of some php applications, but I was interested in installing certbot on that machine
thanks
