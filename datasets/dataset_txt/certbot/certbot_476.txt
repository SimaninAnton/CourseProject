Hello,
I am trying to install but getting error.
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
python-certbot-apache : Depends: python3-certbot-apache but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
Please suggest.
Waiting for reply.
Thanks
