I'm trying to install certbot on a RHEL7 server. I already have epel-release on my server, but when I try to install python-certbot-apache, the package is not found.
$ sudo yum install epel-release
Loaded plugins: product-id, rhnplugin, search-disabled-repos, security,
              : subscription-manager
This system is receiving updates from RHN Classic or RHN Satellite.
Setting up Install Process
Package epel-release-6-8.noarch already installed and latest version
Nothing to do

$ sudo yum install python-certbot-apache
Loaded plugins: product-id, rhnplugin, search-disabled-repos, security,

Setting up Install Process
No package python-certbot-apache available.
Error: Nothing to do
The epel package listing at https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/p/ does not show the python-certbot-apache package.
RHEL 6 has the same issue.
