Hi,
Just a suggestion. I've been using M2Crypto a lot, but it has flaws and there's a new project that aims to be the new 'python cryptographic authority' suitable for 2.x and 3.x:
https://cryptography.io
https://github.com/pyca
Since there's only a few calls made to M2Crypto it might make sense to switch to cryptography. The code is cleaner and well maintained. Which M2Crypto isn't.
