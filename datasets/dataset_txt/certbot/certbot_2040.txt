On Mac OS X 10.11.5, while running certbot-auto after entering an email address I receive the following error:
"ValueError: Invalid header value 'CertbotACMEClient/0.8.0 (darwin 10.11.5\n) Authenticator/apache Installer/apache'
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details"
The most recent logfile in that directory is letsencrypt.txt
