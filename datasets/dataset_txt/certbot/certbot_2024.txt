Hi,
I'd like to suggest the addition of a directory for storing hook scripts executed after a certificate renewal (for example /etc/letsencrypt/hooks.d). This would allow third party packages to easily integrate with certbot without overloading the --post-hook parameter in the cron file. For example a tomcat package could install a script in this directory to create a PKCS12 keystore in /etc/tomcat from the pem files and restart the Tomcat connector after each renewal.
