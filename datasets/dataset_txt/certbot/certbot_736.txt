certbot 0.10.2
Debian Jessie
I've created the directories:
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/pre/
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/post/
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/
and put som scripts in them. Nothing fancy, just echoing some timestamps to a log file, and restarting nginx.
So I thought I'd test if the scripts ran properly by executing:
sudo certbot renew --noninteractive --force-renewal
But the log file appears to be empty. Are the renew-hook scripts not suppose to be fired when i run the command above? Is there a way I can test my scripts without waiting until the certificates needs to be renewed?
Many Thanks!
