I am having problems using certbot-auto, resulting in a 403 error from my Apache installation for the challenge files.
I've already approached the forum about this problem. The thing is, I'd probably be able to debug this for myself, except that certbot takes great pains to undo all the configuration changes it does to my setup. Normally this is a very good thing, but when things break, it completely prevents me from figuring out what went wrong.
I'd like to have an option for certbot to not undo the configuration changes it does (or, at least, store them aside).
