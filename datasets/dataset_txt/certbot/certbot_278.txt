The official certbot documentation at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins indicates that the plugin certbot-dns-linode should still be available; however, I cannot ascertain how one installs it on Ubuntu. I've tried searching on Google to no avail.
There was a thread asking about it at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-dns-linode-missing-from-repository/76513 ..but, no one ever responded with a solution.
If it's not included for automatic installation via PPA for Ubuntu/debian, is there documentation somewhere of how/where to properly install a plugin manually from github? Or, is it just a matter of going to the /certbot/plugins directory on my server and putting the files there? (or will this break things when automatically updating certbot from repository in the future, etc..?)
It's just interesting that the documentation for installing certbot on all platforms is pretty straightforward on the website, but finding things out about plugins is difficult.
