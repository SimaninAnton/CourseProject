Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
Random failures with python-openssl
The old script (./certbot-auto) failed while updating the virtualenv, so I went to the documentation and installed certbot using apt-get.
My system got random errors (it failed some times) with the message: ('bad handshake: SysCallError(0, None)',). Searching the internet I found that uninstalling python-openssl would fix the problem and it did!
Uninstalling the package removed python-certbot since it was a dependency.
