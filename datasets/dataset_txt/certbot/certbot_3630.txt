the rather static docs should be moved from the wiki to the repo and converted to sphinx / reST markup.
the rather dynamic stuff should be kept in the wiki (and maybe linked from docs?).
note: likely this will be a permanent issue, so just update this issue with URLs pointing to wiki pages / sections that are eligible for moving to static docs.
