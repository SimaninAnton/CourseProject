I am developing an installer plugin for certbot which I would like to test by running it with certbot. However I do not have a domain or public web server so I cannot get a real certificate nor do I want to as I am just trying to test this plugin and actual certificate authentication is unnecessary overhead for this task.
It would be helpful if certbot had a kind of developer mode that acts like it had real certificates for whatever domain which could then be used to invoke the installer plugin.
Apologies if this mode does exist already. I did not find such a thing in the documentation.
