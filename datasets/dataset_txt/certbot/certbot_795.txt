I'm trying to get https://letsencrypt.status.io/ to show up in a Google search for [letsencrypt status]. Right now it tries to correct to our "stats" page.
One thing that would help is to get more links to it. Would Certbot be willing to add a link in the footers of the documentation saying "Let's Encrypt status" and linking to the status page? Thanks!
