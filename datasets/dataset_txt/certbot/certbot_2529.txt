Currently if you have an apache vhost file with a VirtualHost containing:
  ServerName site.com
  ServerAlias *.site.com
And pass -d site.com,www.site.com to the Let's Encrypt client, you get a "We were unable to find a vhost with a ServerName or Address of www.site.com" error message and even worse get a selection table.
This is because _find_best_vhost() is completely unaware of aliases.
