Once #1016 is done, it would need interactive UI if it is going to work for the maximum number of users. It should call out to IDisplay once for each domain name, to figure out what the webroot is. Ideally if the domains are example.com and www.example.com the text box for the second of them can be pre-populated with the preceding value?
