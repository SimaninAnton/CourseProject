Hi guys - excellent work, thank you for that.
As usual there's are some minor rough edges - in this case, for me, that's the fact that the webroot plugin doesn't work with the TLS challenge - which is a bit annoying, since I don't have port 80 open and thus I can't properly automate certificate renewal.
Since renewal takes place before the certificate has expired, I think it makes sense to allow the webroot-powered renewal process to work with the TLS challenge - no need to add plugins for that particular type of web server/reverse proxy/load balancer, only a specific path would be used for this as opposed to a whole port (the standalone plugin). Makes it easy to work around limitations that different environments have - in my case, for example, I've haproxy fronting nginx.
