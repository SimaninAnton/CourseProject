I have a handful of domains and I seem to recall (because I see I wrote some script to do this), that I used to be able to use --domain X multiple times with certonly and I think it used to work, but now it does not seem to work. Only one of the domains gets renewed.
should having multiple --domain X --domain Y work and renew multiple at a time? if so, it does not appear to work for me
if not, then how can I get certs renewed (just getting the cert) with a handful at a time?
The reason we want to do this is that we use puppet to manage system configurations and the certs are managed (kept, distributed and installed) with puppet, so I would like to automate this.
For bonus points, I would like to renew multiple domains in one place, even if the certs are not in the same machine. Can you recommend a client to do this (if possible doing it in a machine behind a firewall inside a trusted environment that would drop certs as input into the puppet system).
