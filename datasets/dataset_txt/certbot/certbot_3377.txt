I am not sure if the letsencrypt -h help hasn't been updated or if I am encountering some self-inflicted error.
Seemed failings...
I can't seem to get venv/bin/letsencrypt -h [topic] where topic is all, ect... to work
I don't believe --standalone, --apache, or --nginx are hooked up.
The traditional --authenticator standalone does work though.
Can you check this over @pde to make sure you get the expected output? (I thought -h all at least worked at one point)
