All the way to install all the way wrong
Not found apachectl
vi /root/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/apache2/bin/
Can not find the configuration root directory
ln -a /usr/local/apache2/ect/ /etc/httpd
No vhost exists with servername or alias of yj.huida178.com. No vhost was selected
I can be sure, I configured Vhost
