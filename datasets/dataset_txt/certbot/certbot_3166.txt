We currently have only dev release scripts. We need to create prod release scripts; this includes:
different versioning scheme (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0dev -> 0.2.0 -> ....)
figure out how to do the signing
how to manage changelog
how to manage 0.1.x patch releases
if we're still good with lock-step release of sub-pkgs or are we splitting repos
I think this should be marked for GA milestone, or otherwise we will have to use dev releases...
