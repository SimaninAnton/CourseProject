I Installed certbot-0.8.1 from OpenBSD 6.0 package repo.
Using the "certbot certonly" command, I then entered option 1 (place files in webroot)
and gave my email address for notices.
The program then failed with:
Abort trap (core dumped)
I found some chatter via search engine, suggesting that certbot is calling python and from there, a W^X violation occurs.
There was suggestion to allow/whitelist the program to ignore W^X violations, but this does not sit well with me, especially as this is security sensitive software.
