By using dialog to show the ToS agreement window, it's ~impossible to actually read the ToS using certain terminal emulators.
gnome-terminal allows full-screen UIs to intercept mouse events and dialog does this. As a result I can't right click + open link on the URL, nor can I copy-paste it.
Best way to still read it (other than searching for it or manually copying the URL) is hit agree, then copy-paste it once dialog terminates.
