Major problem, you can't download the certbot-auto or anything because the cert on dl.eff.org is expired. So you can't download it at all as there seems to be no alternate mirrors.

# wget http://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected the certbot script, but I got nothing :(
