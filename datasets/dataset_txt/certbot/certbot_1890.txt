Tried running LE on Centos 6 - Apache 2.4.3
Installed using these root commands:
yum install epel-release
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
When I run ./certbot-auto --apache I run through these dialogs:



And I get this error:
An unexpected error occurred:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/httpd/conf.d/le_tls_sni_01_cert_challenge.conf'
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
The log file is attached here:
