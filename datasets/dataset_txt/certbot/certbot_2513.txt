I tried to obtain and install a staging certificate on an apache2 server. My OS is Debian Jessie.
Is used the command ./letsencrypt-auto --apache.
After accepting the Terms & Conditions and selecting a certificate for all my three domains I got the following error:
apache2: Syntax error on line 219 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 7 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/static-le-ssl.conf: Expected </VirtualHost> but saw </VirtualHost></IfModule>
