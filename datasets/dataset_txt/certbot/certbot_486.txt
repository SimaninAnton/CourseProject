First, I would like to thank everyone who's been working really hard to provide us free SSL.
This post is more of a feature request, I just noticed that when I use the dns-01 challenge, it will take sometime for some servers to get the update from zone files maintained from different Domain Registries. So it will be good to have the challenge checked via Google's DNS which is 8.8.8.8.
From dig TXT +short _acme-challenge.example.com
To dig TXT +short _acme-challenge.duyan.ph @8.8.8.8
I'm not really sure how certbot is doing it's validation, but I bet it's simply relying to how the machine digs on the target.
Thanks!
