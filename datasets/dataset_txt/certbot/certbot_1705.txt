I'm getting debug log even though I have not set it from command line (as much I'm aware of).
Here's the output:
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Starting new HTTPS connection (1): acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org
Cert not yet due for renewal
Keeping the existing certificate
This is how I'm running certbot-auto right now:
./certbot-auto certonly --text --non-interactive --webroot -w /var/www/public/ -d mydomain.com -d www.mydomain.com --keep-until-expiring --expand --agree-tos --email jarmo.p@gmail.com >/dev/null
Why is it output to STDOUT? How to disable it completely?
