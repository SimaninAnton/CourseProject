Suppose you originally obtained a certificate using the following command:
letsencrypt certonly --webroot --webroot-map '{"example.com,example.org" : "/var/www/html"}'
When you to renew the certificate, suppose the webroot paths have changed so you use the command:
letsencrypt renew --webroot-map '{"example.com" : "/var/www/com", "example.org" : "/var/www/org"}'
When you do this, you get the following error message:
Error: Currently, the renew verb is only capable of renewing all installed certificates that are due to be renewed; individual domains cannot be specified with this action. If you would like to renew specific certificates, use the certonly command. The renew verb may provide other options for selecting certificates to renew in the future.
This problem is caused because --webroot-map modifies domains which currently isn't allowed to be modified during renewal.
