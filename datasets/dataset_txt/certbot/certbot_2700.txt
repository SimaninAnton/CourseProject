Hello,
" root@ns3:~/letsencrypt# ./letsencrypt-auto
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt
An unexpected error occurred:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 9: invalid continuation byte
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details. "
This is a domain containing accents, how can I fix that?
Sincerely
