My operating system is (include version):
macOS 10.13.4
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
brew install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
# certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator manual, Installer None

  signer = key.signer(self.padding, self.hash)
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Didn't expect spewed warning about deprecated whatever.
