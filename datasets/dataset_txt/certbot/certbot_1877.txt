When filtering config parameters from renewal config files, certbot checks their prefix to see if they are specific to a plugin. However, the prefix it tests with has not had hyphens replaced with underscores, where as the config parameters it tests against have.
Example: https://github.com/dlapiduz/letsencrypt-s3front
Solution: https://github.com/code-tree/certbot/commit/74166b6d6e37dd344d64bffe741fb6fea4be3335
Patch fixes it for me, though there may be a cleaner solution to this?
