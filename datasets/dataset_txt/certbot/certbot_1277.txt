My operating system is (include version):
OpenSUSE Leap 42.2
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager (https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?project=devel%3Alanguages%3Apython&package=certbot)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It wrote this:
Saving debug log to /var/log/certbot/letsencrypt.log
Currently, the renew verb is capable of either renewing all installed certificates that are due to be renewed or renewing a single certificate specified by its name. If you would like to renew specific certificates by their domains, use the certonly command. The renew verb may provide other options for selecting certificates to renew in the future.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.

What can I do? :(
Thanks in advance.
