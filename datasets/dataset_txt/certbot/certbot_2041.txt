Using Mac OS X 10.11.5 following instructions from https://certbot.eff.org/#osx-apache
When running ./certbot-auto, on the the input windows for domains and email addresses, as soon as I type a period or number it returns to the command prompt with one of the following messages:
"Please specify --domains, or --installer that will help in domain names autodiscovery"
"An e-mail address or --register-unsafely-without-email must be provided"
Appending -t and using the text mode lets me respond to the prompts correctly.
