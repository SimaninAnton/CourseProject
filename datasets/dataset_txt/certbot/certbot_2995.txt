Hi there,
I just got accepted into the beta, and I'm attempting to install a certificate using the instructions in the email. This is the command I'm running, and what's happening:
$   ./letsencrypt-auto --apache --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-dev-preview
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.....Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): ConfigArgParse from git+https://github.com/kuba/ConfigArgParse.git@python2.6-0.9.3#egg=ConfigArgParse in /home/web/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from -r py26reqs.txt (line 1))
..
Running with virtualenv: sudo /home/web/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-dev-preview
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: NoInstallationError()
I personally have no clue what's going on â€” while I'm tech savvy, this is above my head. Would appreciate any pointers :)
