Hi,
I got a problem with the current certbot Version on my system.
After I want to run certbot renew --dry-run i got the error :
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --max-log-backups 0
When I only run certbot to for displaying the options i also get the same error.
I have installed it after the tutorial for Ubuntu on the certbto main page.
Is this a known error or have i blow up something with a update of my system. ?
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS Package
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot
usage:
certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...
Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates. By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert.
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --max-log-backups 0
