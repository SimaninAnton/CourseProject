Once #7268 lands, we should warn about Certbot and its components deprecating Python 3.4 support. To do this we should:
Have acme use Python's warning system to register deprecation warnings.
Log warnings using the logging module in Certbot.
You can see how we did this for previous versions of Python in our git history.
