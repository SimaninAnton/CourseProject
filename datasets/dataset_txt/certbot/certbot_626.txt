I'm importing acme module into a separate project.
If I have a DNS01 object and call dns_object.validation_domain_name("*.example.org"), it will return the string _acme-challenge.*.example.org. This is incorrect as the server is looking at _acme-challenge.example.org as the validation domain.
I believe the validation_domain_name function should reflect this.
