Sorry, but are you insane?
I was just trying to test your software - and you are installing packages nad python environments without asking?
You should ALWAYS ask a user if you are allowed to install sw. ESPECIALLY if the user invokes only the "help" command!
Please give me a list of files and packages your software installed. I want to purge it completely!
