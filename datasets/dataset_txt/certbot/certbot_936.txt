This shouldn't happen:
certbot install --cert-name example.com
usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate. 
certbot: error: argument --cert-path is required
We've been putting this off because certbot or certbot run basically works fine as an installer. But with wildcards becoming available via dns plugins, we might want to give instructions like:
certbot certonly -a some-dns-plugin 
certbot install -i nginx --cert-name x
or similar.
