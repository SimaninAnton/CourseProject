Currently we always enable OCSP stapling and do so when deploying the certificate. There's an enhancements system in Certbot which can be used to request/enable OCSP stapling, but the Nginx plugin ignores that entirely.
In the short term (for 0.9.0), I think we should remove OSCP stapling from the Nginx plugin. In the long term, we should make sure it properly uses the enhancements system and either:
Make OCSP stapling the default in Certbot
Only enable OCSP stapling in Nginx when requested by the user
