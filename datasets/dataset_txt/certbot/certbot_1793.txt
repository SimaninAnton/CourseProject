It'd be nice if we could help people set up cron or systemd timers to automatically run certbot renew -q. Ideally, for packaged versions of Certbot, this job should be left up to the package maintainer. For certbot-auto users, we could offer to try and set up the cronjob or systemd timer for them.
If we do this, we should probably only do so when installing OS packages (which should only happen once per system) and we should prompt the user to ask permissions (unless they included something like --noninteractive on the command line). We should avoid causing certbot-auto to be run automatically on systems where Certbot is already installed and there is an existing integration around certbot-auto.
Putting this behavior in certbot-auto has a couple of downsides:
It doesn't help people installing directly through pip (which we never tell anyone to do).
Some distributions may not create a crontab for us due to ideological reasons or because they don't know they're supposed to. This will leave these users to deal with their own cron/systemd setup.
With that said, I personally prefer putting this behavior in certbot-auto rather than the core Certbot client, but I want to make sure we know the limitations here up front.
