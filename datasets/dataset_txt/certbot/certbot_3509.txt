The reporter code that tells the user about what the client has done is being updated to indicate whether or not certs are going to be autorenewed (and autodeployed). The way that it knows is by looking at the ConfigObj inside of the RenewableCert that was created when the cert was first obtained and enrolled.
I think this ConfigObj's notion of whether autorenewal and autodeployment are enabled is the same as the decision that renewer.py will come to when it runs later. But we need to double-check that this is correct so that the user doesn't end up getting misleading information.
