I just watched an otherwise-interested user trying to get started with letsencrypt decide the whole project was not trustworthy after having it start installing packages when asked to print usage information via (as shown in the README) ./letsencrypt-auto --help. This is very bad initial UX. The --help option should work as documented (without modifying anything about the system it's run on) and there should either be a strong warning in the README that letsencrypt-auto invokes the system package manager to install packages, or it should interactively request permission to do so when run without arguments.
