I'm not sure what the current sort order represents, but it's a bit odd
Being able to sort by validity is helpful for figuring out what's expiring soon.
Being able to sort by certificate name is helpful because it's an easier thing to understand than the random sort that's currently deployed.
fwiw, I currently have:
b.example.com (valid 58 days)
a.example.com (valid 89 days)
c.example.com (valid 58 days)
n.example.com (valid 58 days)
example.net (valid 63 days)
l.example.com (valid 58 days)
It clearly isn't sorted by name (b/a), by validity (58, 89, 58), nor tld.
Sorting by each of those could be useful.
Expected for validity:
a.example.com (valid 89 days)
example.net (valid 63 days)
b.example.com (valid 58 days)
c.example.com (valid 58 days)
n.example.com (valid 58 days)
l.example.com (valid 58 days)
Expected for certificate:
a.example.com (valid 89 days)
b.example.com (valid 58 days)
c.example.com (valid 58 days)
example.net (valid 63 days)
l.example.com (valid 58 days)
n.example.com (valid 58 days)
For tld, I think the algorithm should be:
sort by by each leaf, resorting by leafs to the right.
a.example.com (valid 89 days)
b.example.com (valid 58 days)
c.example.com (valid 58 days)
l.example.com (valid 58 days)
n.example.com (valid 58 days)
example.net (valid 63 days)
