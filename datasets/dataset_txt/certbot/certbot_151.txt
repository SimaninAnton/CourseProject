I’ve been successfully using Let’s Encrypt on a particular domain for quite some time. I’ve chosen it to experiment with Must-Staple. So I issued the command:
$ certbot enhance --must-staple
certbot configured Apache to start stapling. But it didn’t create a new certificate. hmm. So I forced a renewal of the certificate. It renewed, no problem. But the renewed certificate does not have Must-Staple enabled.
Is something broken or am I doing something wrong?
I posted this earlier to the Let's Encrypt forum ( https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-enhance-must-staple/94107 ).
