My operating system is (include version):
Gentoo Base System release 2.3
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
emerge certbot-apache (9999 version from git)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
router / # certbot --apache
Traceback (most recent call last):

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'fasteners' distribution was not found and is required by certbot
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
cannot identify distribution
