https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html states:
If youâ€™re running on Linux, you can run the following commands to install dependencies and set up a virtual environment where you can run Certbot. You only need to do this once.
cd certbot
./certbot-auto --os-packages-only
./tools/venv.sh
While this seems to be accurate for many (most?) cases, it seems to be necessary to re-run ./tools/venv.sh when defining a new plugin in setup.py.
That may be an uncommon use case though, so perhaps that caveat belongs in the "Writing your own plugin" section. That section could also be expanded to describe the high-level changes which are necessary for defining a new plugin.
