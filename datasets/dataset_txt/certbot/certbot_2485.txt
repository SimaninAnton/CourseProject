poing commented on 29 Jan 2016
The renewal process becomes cumbersome, when I have to restart or manually verify the domain. Especially, when using letsencrypt certs on an unsupported platform. For instance, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Please consider a method to, renew by authenticating against a key or previous validation. Such as privkey.pem or other variable. Maybe?
I understand the reason for verification, no looking to circumvent it. There should me a method to verify once and allow for a simpler re-verification. How about, allowing the manual method .hidden_path_name/file to remain valid (unless a single check fails).
Otherwise, for me, renewal involve DNS changes to point to a temporary server. Renewal, push certs to live system, then revert the DNS.
Anyway, just some thoughts on enhancing the renewal process. Thanks for reading.
