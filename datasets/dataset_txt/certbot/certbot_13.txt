If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Debain 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/usr/local/bin/certbot-auto certonly --apache
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --agree-dev-preview true
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
No log files
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:443>
                ServerName DOMAINNAME.ae
                ServerAlias www.DOMAINNAME.ae *.DOMAINNAME.ae
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/DOMAINNAME/public
        SSLEngine on
                SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/DOMAINNAME/DOMAINNAME.ae-cert.pem
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/DOMAINNAME/DOMAINNAME.ae-key.pem
                SSLCertificateChainFile "/etc/apache2/ssl/DOMAINNAME/DOMAINNAME.ae-letsencrypt.pem"
                SSLCACertificatePath "/etc/apache2/ssl/DOMAINNAME/"
                SSLCACertificateFile "/etc/apache2/ssl/DOMAINNAME/DOMAINNAME.ae-letsencrypt.pem"
    </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
