My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto version 0.22.2
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ certbot-auto renew
Upgrading certbot-auto 0.22.1 to 0.22.2...
Replacing certbot-auto...
Creating virtual environment...
Installing Python packages...
Installation succeeded.

Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/some-wildcard-certificate.conf

Renewal configuration file /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/some-wildcard-certificate.conf (cert: some-wildcard-certificate) produced an unexpected error: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'dns_cloudflare_credentials'. Skipping.

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The plugin certbot-dns-cloudflare was installed via /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/pip install certbot-dns-cloudflare at version 0.22.1. Our nightly certificate renewal process via certbot-auto renew updated certbot and purged the installed plugin. As it seems this is intended behavior but I expect a mission critical plugin like that to be installed permanently.
