I got this email from Docker over the holidays:
Docker Hub Automated Builds affected by Github Services deprecation
We have identified that your Docker Hub account contains Classic Automated Builds that are using GitHub Services.
GitHub Services are being deprecated on January 31st, 2019 and will experience an interruption of service from January 7th to January 13th, 2019, inclusive. Our attempt to automatically upgrade your Automated Builds to use GitHub Webhooks has failed due to an issue accessing your GitHub repositories.
We advise you to take action to reestablish your build web hooks before Monday, January 7th, 2019 to avoid affecting your workflow.
Thank you for your attention in this matter. If you have any questions or concerns please contact us at hub@docker.com.
It looks like our Docker setup is relying on GitHub services. If I remember correctly, I did things these way to not give Docker a ton of write permissions on our repo. If giving them these permissions is the only way to do things now, we could consider it, but I think it should be avoided if possible.
