executing command:
letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone -d myDomain
expected:
To have PEM file
Actual:
Failed to connect to xx.xx.xx.xxx:443 for TLS-SNI-01 challenge
My question is why the domain must have this TLS challenge while all what I am asking for is to generate certification to be able to convert my server from HTTP to HTTPS?
I thought it's obvious that how want to generate certification maybe have no TLS #server, I will be happy to have an explain
Thank you
