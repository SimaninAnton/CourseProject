We have a considerable volume of forum posts where people get the PluginError(‘An authentication script must be provided with --manual-auth-hook when using the manual plugin non-interactively.’,) message
https://community.letsencrypt.org/search?q=%22authentication%20script%20must%20be%20provided%22%20order%3Alatest
and it seems that a very high fraction of people who encounter that error don't understand what it's trying to tell them. They often don't know what an authentication script is in this context, some don't know what the manual plugin is, and most don't realize that using the manual plugin non-interactively means "running certbot renew".
This error exists for good historical reasons, but the way that it appears is most often unhelpful to people who don't understand much about Certbot plugins and challenges. We should find a way to totally revamp this output and give people more specific and practical advice about what's happening and what they can do about it.
