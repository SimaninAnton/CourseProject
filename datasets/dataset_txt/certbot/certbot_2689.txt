I see that :conf/renewal/:hostname.confhas a field tos = True and I couldn't find anything out about it in the docs, but I'd like to suggest that it allow either a string url or True.
The purpose of the string url is that if the tos changes and the user has decided (in some user interface) that they would not like certificates to renew until they have had the opportunity to view the revised terms to which they will be legally bound that the renewal should fail.
I know this seems unlikely, but there are some people who take this stuff very seriously and others who don't.
As of the current date I think it's generally agreed upon that Mozilla and the EFF have goals and values that align with their customers. And of course they always will be, forever (maybe).
But other companies may step up to the plate that do not have their customers' best interests in mind - those who use free ssl as a marketing tactic and later abuse their customers privacy or other rights. It's uncomfortable to unwittingly sell your immortal soul, especially automatically.
