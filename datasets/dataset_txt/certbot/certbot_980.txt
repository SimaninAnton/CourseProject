My operating system is (include version):
Debian (Deepin)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
pip, certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AccessKey"  \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="SecretAKey" \
certbot --agree-tos -a certbot-s3front:auth \
--certbot-s3front:auth-s3-bucket staticbokito \
-i certbot-s3front:installer \
--certbot-s3front:installer-cf-distribution-id E4BQ4258M4M6 \
-d staticbokito.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
Output
Error creating new authz :: Policy forbids issuing for name
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It didn't generated the certificate
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
letsencrypt.txt
Any help would be greatly appreciated
