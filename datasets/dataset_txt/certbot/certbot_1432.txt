Right now we suggest users use manual auth hooks to allow them to do the DNS challenge, and we even go so far as to suggest example scripts for them to run, but at no point do we explain what that challenge is doing!
There is already some things written about this in the manual plugin, which gets written out to the user when they call certbot certonly --manual without an auth hook flag. This command can give you information about any of our challenges, and you can specify which one by specifying that challenge with the --preferred-challenge flag.
Note that like the webroot challenge, certbot will tell the user to put certain files in certain directories to be served as part of the challenge. These files and directories are generated randomly for each run and shouldn't be put verbatim into the documentation. You can also look at these suggestions directly in the code: https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot/plugins/manual.py
