After making the change in #6860, I hit more issues trying to set up a development environment on CentOS 6. The issue was tools/venv3.py trys to run python3 -m virtualenv ..., but CentOS 6 does not offer a Python 3 virtualenv package so the command fails.
I think think we could avoid this problem here and elsewhere by using the venv module which is included in Python 3.4+ (which is the only versions of Python 3 we support). Making this change requires changing the flags passed to venv as well and may mean that less code is in tools/_venv_common.py and more of the work has to be done in tools/venv.py and tools/venv3.py, but I personally think this change is worth it.
