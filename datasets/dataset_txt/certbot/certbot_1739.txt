Running off of the nginx-compatibility-test branch, I saw some strange behavior. When testing with all of nginx.tar.gz the tests all pass when -ai is included on the command line. However, I created a tarball with the majority of the virtual host files removed and the tests failed due to the problem identified in #3605. What happened?
