Two problems:
Problem 1:
For some reason certbot-auto renew results in connection errors for me:
2016-06-10 14:43:07,461:WARNING:certbot.renewal:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/<redacted>.conf produced an unexpected error: Failed authorization procedure. <redacted> (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Failed to connect to <redacted>:443 for TLS-SNI-01 challenge. Skipping.
My domains and IP address are perfectly accessible over HTTPS, so I'm a bit confused here.
Problem 2:
When running certbot-auto renew any traffic to port 443 seems to be delayed/blocked. Browsers will show "Establishing secure connection" while the process is running.
Any help is appreciated.
