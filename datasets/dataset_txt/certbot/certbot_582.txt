Certificate with Both privkey.pem and fullchain.pem
Would it be possible for certbot to automatically create a pem certificate file that contains both the privkey and fullchain in one pem file when creating a certificate for the first time or when a certificate is renewed?
Programs like courier, lighttpd, and vsftpd use certificates in this format.
Usually, I have to run a command to manually combine both certificates like this:
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/test.com/privkey.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/test.com/fullchain.pem > /etc/letsencrypt/live/test.com/courier.pem && /usr/sbin/service courier-pop-ssl restart && /usr/sbin/service courier-imap-ssl restart
By default, certbot creates cert.pem, chain.pem, fullchain.pem, and privkey.pem files for each domain. Perhaps another one called mixed.pem could be created (and updated when renewed) by default? This would be ideal because then I don't have to manually combine them.

My operating system is Ubuntu 16.04 x64
I installed Certbot with certbot-auto
