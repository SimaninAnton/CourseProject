To facilitate automation, we should have error status results be clearly distinguishable from one another in a machine-readable way (either using distinctive return codes based on the error reason or having a standard set of error strings that are output).
Right now, ACME-related errors can be distinguished using the urn:acme:error strings that are sent by the server (and can be displayed to the user), but non-ACME-related errors can't be unless you make your own table of the particular strings that get displayed. And the return status is always 1 regardless of the reason.
