There are a few other recommended configurations when configuring an NGINX server for server like adding the ssl_protocols, ssl_session and so on.
I started working on extending the Nginx plugin already to add these directives when configuring the server but tests are failing due to the parser adding directives at 0 index when in reality, it should be appended after the ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key fields respectively.
I'm still looking into a way to get around this. The Nginx issue 810 has been closed with a wontfix label which makes matters a little troubling.
