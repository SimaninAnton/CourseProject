If I run letsencrypt-auto manually, e.g. ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d example.com then it works fine. If however I try to do the same thing but using a configuration file as described in the User Guide, it does not work:
$ ./letsencrypt-auto -c /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini 
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies......
Requesting root privileges to run with virtualenv: sudo /home/jon/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt -c /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
No installers seem to be present and working on your system; fix that or try running letsencrypt with the "certonly" command
My cli.ini file is as follows:
email = webmaster@example.com
domains = example.com
authenticator = webroot
webroot-path = /var/www/html
