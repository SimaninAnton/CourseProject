Travis latency is a pretty major drag on Certbot developers. Here are some steps could help:
Get rid of py27, since cover covers it
Split integration tests out of the unit test matrix entries, which would allow them to be run in parallel
Pick some things that we don't expect to fail more than once in blue moon, and only run those during releases and/or on obs7. The most likely candidate would be the -oldest matrix elements.
