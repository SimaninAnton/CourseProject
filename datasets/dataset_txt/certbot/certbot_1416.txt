When running letsencrypt-auto --help --debug BootstrapMac function attempts to install pip and virtualenv with this code:
curl --silent --show-error --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py |  python
pip install virtualenv
Since /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ is owned by root with 755 permissions installation fails with permission error.
One way to "fix" it is to chmod -R 777 site-packages packages directory as described in this blog post.
Another way is to add $SUDO to install commands:
curl --silent --show-error --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py |  $SUDO python
$SUDO pip install virtualenv
This appears to work (tested on Sierra 10.12.3 with both MacPorts and HomeBrew).
