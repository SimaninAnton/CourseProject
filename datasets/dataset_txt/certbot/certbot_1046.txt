My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Ubuntu PPA (add-apt-repository …)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
the supplied cronjob
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py:1869: UserWarning: /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rpl-1.5.5.egg-info could not be properly decoded in UTF-8 warnings.warn(msg)
python-pkg-resources:
  Installed: 33.1.1-1+certbot~trusty+1
rpl:
  Installed: 1.5.5-1
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
This message only showed up after I installed rpl via the standard Ubuntu Trusty sources. Previously it ran perfectly quiet. The same thing seems to work without issue on Debian Jessie or Ubuntu Xenial.
Please let me know if you believe this is not your bug instead of closing without comment so I can report it elsewhere.
