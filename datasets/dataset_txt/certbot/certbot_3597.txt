@jdkasten, we should set up a FAQ list ASAP, as some questions notoriously keep coming back.
Do you support wildcard certificates? Multidomain?
Why does the client require root?
Launch time?
Are Letsencrypt certificates recognized by modern browsers and operating systems? How is IdenTrust related?
Target audience? (Individuals, companies?)
Some of them are not much related to the client implementation, but it's mostly us hanging around in #letsencrypt who have to answer...
I'd personally put it in docs/faq.rst rather than GitHub wiki.
