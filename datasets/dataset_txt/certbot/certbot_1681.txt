I saw #2241, but instead of support, to me looks like an ignore of the trailing dot?
Because if a trailing dot is defined, certbot ignores it and creates the certificate for the domain without the trailing dot, and the result is:
$ curl -vvv https://example.com.
*   Trying x...
* Connected to example.com. (x) port 443 (#0)
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Server hello (2):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, CERT (11):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Server key exchange (12):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Server finished (14):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Client key exchange (16):
* SSLv3, TLS change cipher, Client hello (1):
* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Finished (20):
* SSLv3, TLS change cipher, Client hello (1):

*        subjectAltName does not match example.com.
* Closing connection 0
* SSLv3, TLS alert, Client hello (1):
curl: (51) SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK
This was after run certbot with param -d example.com.
Is there any way to generate certificates with a trailing dot in the CN or SAN with certbot?
Im asking because all my previous providers supported (without removing) the trailing dot and is a bit shocking to see #2241.
Thank you''
