Certbot has a number of configuration files. Specifically we have a cli.ini file that handles global configuration & files in /etc/letsencrypyt/renewal that are lineage configuration files (relating to #4016)
This also relates to #4096
These need to be documented!
In theory we only need to document cli.ini since we have other documentation about how to update the renewal configs, but if we decide that we want people to edit these by hand it would be prudent to document them.
