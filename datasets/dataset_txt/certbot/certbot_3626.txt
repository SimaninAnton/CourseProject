there is a more-or-less unrelated and out-of-scope security disussion in PR #200 which mostly comes from a unclear / undocumented threat model, still existing general problems in letsencrypt (like always and early requiring root, see also issue #204), scope of what a user can configure (or not), what a user can give (or not) on cli interface.
also it seems to be that usage of letsencrypt is meant not to be limited to direct manual commandline use by some user, but also as a tool that is embedded into other tools (like a library or via calling letsencrypt automatically).
to keep the discussion of PR #200 in-scope, I suggest to create documentation that gives threat models we need to deal with, documents already existing solutions against these threats or proposes yet-to-get implemented solutions (and shows how they are effective against the threat in case that is non-obvious).
for stuff that is still to do in general / global for misc. parts of the code, separate issues shall get opened.
