So I have a really simple load balancing setup with 2 A records. It appears that certbot sometimes fails with Failed authorization procedure. HOSTNAME (http-01): urn:ietf:params:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Invalid response from https://HOSTNAME/.well-known/acme-challenge/... [IP]: "<h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested URL /.well-known/acme-challenge/... was not found.
I was wondering if certbot could tell letsencrypt what ip to send the authorization request (it could grep out the ip out of ifconfig or something). Does the letsencrypt protocol even support something like this?
I was using the apache plugin on centos 7.
And yes, you could say that I should use the DNS challenges but I can't use that unfortunately.
