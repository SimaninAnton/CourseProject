Forum user Randall describes this problem when using letsencrypt renew:
...The error was Expected a numeric value for http01_port. ...
Editing the file /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/[my.domain].conf file solved this problem. I changed http01_port = None to http01_port = 80

@bmw said that this would have been fixed (in terms of renewal config files correctly specifying http01_port) back in November, but people who have older lineages than that may have this problem when renewing with standalone. That could conceivably be a pretty large number of users!
