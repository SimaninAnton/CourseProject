When I try to run letsencrypt for a pretty much barebone setup (Ubuntu 14.04 inside a Docker container, with an Apache configured for www.example.com, thus only the host line commented out in the default vhost and not reachable from the Internet), it fails after this screen:
Generating key: /etc/apache2/ssl/key-letsencrypt_1.pem  
Creating CSR: /etc/apache2/certs/csr-letsencrypt_1.pem

Performing the following challenges:                    
  DVSNI challenge for name www.example.com.             
Created an SSL vhost at                                 
/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-le-ssl.conf 
with following traaceback:

I guess this is a problem with a non-verifiable domain, but I didn't test yet with a proper hostname and connect to the internet. Anyway, at least a better error message should be printed.
