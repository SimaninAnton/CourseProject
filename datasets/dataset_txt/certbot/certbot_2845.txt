My ISP blocks port 80, but allows port 443 inbound. I successfully pulled a cert by using standalone with the --standalone-supported-challenges tls-sni-01 flag to force 443/https and used the cert. However, if I want to automate it, I can't shut down my nginx instance in order to verify the domain.
I'm using this command to renew the cert.
This is the command I'm using to run: ./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a webroot --renew-by-default --email me@example.com -w /tmp/letsencrypt-auto -d domain1.com
However, I keep getting the following error:
Could not connect to http://domain..com/.well-known/acme-challenge/DVtvdatt1XYUVJlu2cO9
zZmHnzyisUh6WmqreqoivwM, domain.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client for DV
There doesn't appear to be a flag for forcing 443/https to be used, so it keeps using 80/http, and failing. Is this a limitation for webroot?
Thanks!
