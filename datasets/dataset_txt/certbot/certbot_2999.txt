I just got invited in the beta and tried to run Let's Encrypt on a CentOS 6.7 VPS machine. I have cloned the repo and ran the following command:
sudo ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
The dependencies were correctly installed and I didn't get any error message. However the /etc/letsencrypt folder wasn't created, and every time I rerun ./letsencrypt-auto it just checks against yum again. Even if I try to generate a certificate (for instance sudo letsencrypt -d www.example.org auth).
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. The documentation isn't clear on this - just says to substitute all the "letsencrypt" with "letsencrypt-auto" but that's it. Not sure what else to do.
