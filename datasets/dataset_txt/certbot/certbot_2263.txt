I've used letsencrypt successfully on other servers, however when I test it on a server that is hosting multiple domains it fails to correctly parse the apache config file. When I attempt to run it I get the following error:
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/httpd/conf/plesk.conf.d/server.conf', u'Syntax error'),)
However when I check the config file for errors, it returns an ok status:
apachectl configtest
Syntax OK
Below you can see the configuration file:
