It would be nice if the setup docs would explain the generated pem files....
Running the ./certbot-auto certonly, generates the required certificates but they are confusing since most configs refer to them as *.key, *.cert etc...
cert.pem => cert file (.crt)
chain.pem => ca file (.ca)
fullchain.pem => ca file (.ca) With more info ?
privkey.pem => key file (.key)
Si I have limited knowledge of the SSL details this was confusing for me when setting up.
I do get that these are "just'" text files, but this was a friction point for me.
