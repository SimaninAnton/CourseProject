For documentation down the road for Letsencrypt, would love something that lays out the client usage like https://sslmate.com/help/automation and https://sslmate.com/help/getting_started where it's formatted in a step by step basis structure which is end user task oriented.
You could break it down by
native Ubuntu/Debian Apache 2.2/2.4 distro package install
native Ubuntu/Debian Nginx distro package install
CentOS/RHEL Apache distro package install
CentOS/RHEL Nginx distro package install
Other Apache source/custom installs
Other Nginx source/custom installs
This is as opposed to just listing the Letsencrypt client options etc.
