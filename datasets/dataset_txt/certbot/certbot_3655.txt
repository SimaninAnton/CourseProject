The README misses some dependencies. I didn't provide a pull request as this is somewhat subject for discussion. I found them missing while constructing a docker file from minimal Ubuntu for playing with.
Dependencies given:
sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools python-virtualenv \
  python-dev gcc swig dialog libaugeas0 libssl-dev
Additionally required:
openssl, this also should definitely be listed in a future package as requirement
right now, git is required to fetch the code (this might be debatable)
ca-certificates is required for communication with the ACME server, and also for fetching the code with git
None of these get installed when setting up apache2 and the already listed requirements with apt-get install --no-install-recommends.
