As suggested by the documentation, I tried this, which failed:
$ ./venv/bin/letsencrypt --config examples/dev-cli.ini auth
usage:
letsencrypt [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [domains]
The Let's Encrypt agent can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates. By
default, it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing
the cert.
letsencrypt: error: unrecognized arguments: --config-dir /tmp/le/conf --work-dir /tmp/le/conf --logs-dir /tmp/le/logs --email foo@example.com --domains example.com --text --agree-eula --debug --verbose --authenticator standalone
