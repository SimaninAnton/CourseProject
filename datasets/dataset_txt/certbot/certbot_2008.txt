Kinda related to #3149 .
To work around this I was able to renew my certificates by stopping apache, using the standalone option and then starting it. However, after each renewed cert, apache is reloaded, even when certbot runs in standalone mode and the web server wasn't running when certbot was started. (can't it wants the port available)
It's totally logical to reload a web server when using it's plugin, but please, leave the server alone when running in standalone mode. It's a fallback for when the regular modes don't work. (or you're renewing a cert for something else, like an imap server...)
