I have one case of this:
root@ip-172-31-50-10:/etc/letsencrypt/renewal# grep domains /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/isnot.org.conf 
domains = None
root@ip-172-31-50-10:/etc/letsencrypt/renewal# openssl x509 -inform PEM -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/isnot.org/cert.pem -text -noout | grep -1 Name

            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
                DNS:isnot.org, DNS:is.isnot.org
and another case where the file has domains in it. We need to be consistent about whether we do or don't have domains listed in that file; and if we do, they need to be respected (if not, we should put them in a comment).
