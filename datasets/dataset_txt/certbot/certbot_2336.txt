I have cloned your source code from GIT's repository:
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
I'm trying to test your services on Ubuntu 14.04.4 server and having an issue at startup while issuing command:
./letsencrypt-auto --help
It tries to upgrade from v0.4.1 -> 0.4.2 but it ends up with an error:
Checking for new version... Upgrading letsencrypt-auto 0.4.1 to 0.4.2... Couldn't download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/v0.4.2/letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto. <urlopen error [Errno 1] _ssl.c:510: error:140773E8:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:reason(1000)>
After a quick research, I've found out it might be an error related to python's library but I'm not a python developer and have no idea how to fix it.
Is there any way to solve this issue? Any alternative way of upgrading etc. ?
