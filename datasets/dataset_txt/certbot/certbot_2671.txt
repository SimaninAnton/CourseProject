Hello!
We have big amount of customers with our own custom server management toolkit. For security reasons we are not using hostnames and use main server IP as web panel address.
And we want to issues certificates for IP itself.
We tried to do it with Letsencrypt but haven't any success here:
The request message was malformed :: Error creating new authz :: Issuance for IP addresses not supported
Could you add support for certificates issues for IP addresses?
