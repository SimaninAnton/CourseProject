My operating system is (include version):
gentoo
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
portage
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot --nginx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It prefixed the line with several spaces, although i prefix lines with tabs in my config files. Can easily be resolved by copying the prefix of previous line instead of hard coding whitespaces.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
        server_name www.ertwertw.ewrt .erwtwert.ewrt;
        include snippets/gwert.conf;
}
