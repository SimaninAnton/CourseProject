If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:certbot/certbot'.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I received an error message instead of installing the PPA
It appears the PPA is no longer supported. Is there an alternative to install certbot?
