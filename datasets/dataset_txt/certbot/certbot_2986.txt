We currently have a bunch of hairy special cases where flags are documented in different places depending on which help topics are being displayed. These are bad to maintain, so we should either have HelpfulArgumentParser know about and organise them automatically (alternatively, we chould completely rearchitect cli.py to give good concise topic-based help in some better way, such as writing our own argument parser, forking [config]argparse in the tree, or something else..).
