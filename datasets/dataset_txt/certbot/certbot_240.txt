Tests on the Certbot website started failing last night because https://bettercrypto.org/static/applied-crypto-hardening.pdf linked to at https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/docs/ciphers.rst#bettercryptoorg is returning a 404.
We should update this page of our documentation to a working link. Maybe to another page on bettercrypto.org? Maybe to archive.org? I'm not sure what's most appropriate.
After this change lands in this repository, we need update the Certbot submodule in the website repo to get tests working again.
@schoen, are you interested/able to fix this?
