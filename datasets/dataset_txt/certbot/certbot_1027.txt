Not doing this broke master and caused tests on all PRs to fail. I believe this only needs to be done for our new DNS plugins. This should probably be done using the mechanism like the one found in tools/install_and_test.sh so all tests benefit. This prevents failures for all tests if a new version of dependency breaks an API we use.
Doing something like this was suggested by @bobstrecansky.
