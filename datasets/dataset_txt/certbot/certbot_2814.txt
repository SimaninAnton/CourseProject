I have my apache2 server running behind an openvpn server, which passes trough anything not vpn related. the problem is that when I run let's encrypt with the apache plugin, it messes with my ports.conf. So I first have to stop openvpn, then start the let's encrypt script. after that, I have to cleanup my configs so it'l have port 4545 for ssl instead of 443. Then I need to restart apache2 and after that I can start my vpn again. I really don't want to write a script that does all of the above.
Will there be or is there a way to specify costum ports for the apache2 configs beforehand?
