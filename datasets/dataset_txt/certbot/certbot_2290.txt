Hey there,
I'm one of the developers of the i-MSCP project (https://i-mscp.net/) and planning a plugin for our open-source control panel. With this plugin for customers it should be possible to activate https with a valid connection in just one click.
ATM for installation our customers need to clone the current git repository and rerun installation routine. Packages are just available for the debian testing repositories (as I read). It would be very nice to ship packages also for at least Debian Jessie and Ubuntu 14.04 :-)
Best regards
