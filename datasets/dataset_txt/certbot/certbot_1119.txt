When I execute certbot renew, I get the following error:
An unexpected error occurred:
VersionConflict: (certbot 0.10.2 (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('certbot==0.9.3'))
Please see the logfile 'certbot.log' for more details.
Looking at the timestamps on /var/log/letsencrypt it seems that Certbot is crashing before it opens a logfile, since that directory was last modified ~1 month ago.
I'm on Debian Jessie. Certbot was installed via APT and jessie-backports:
% apt-cache policy {,python-}certbot     
certbot:
  Installed: 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1
  Candidate: 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1
  Version table:
 *** 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1 0
        100 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
python-certbot:
  Installed: 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1
  Candidate: 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1
  Version table:
 *** 0.10.2-1~bpo8+1 0
        100 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
sudo apt-get install -f does nothing, and debsums -s {,python-}certbot exits successfully.
if this is a downstream packaging issue, I'm happy to bring it up with the Debian folks. I'm filing here since poking around the issue tracker turned up similar issues that indeed ended up being upstream bugs.
