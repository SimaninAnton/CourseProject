The nginx compatibility tests fail when taking #3565, merging in master, and running tests. All failures are due to redirects where the tests expect us to have set up a redirect, but we have not (correctly) done so. In all/most cases, we've added a commented out redirect in the nginx config and output a message like:
The appropriate server block is already redirecting traffic. To enable redirect anyway, uncomment the redirect lines in ...
I don't expect there to be a critical issue here. I think either:
We're being too conservative and not enabling redirects when we should.
The compatibility tests themselves are wrong.
Neither of these things is a big deal. Here is a log of the issue (after modifying tox.ini to skip authenticator tests which all currently pass). It'd be nice to get these tests working because they could easily be run automatically as part of #2189.
