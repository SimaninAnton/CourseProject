it just ran letsencrypt (did no other modifications) and let ssllabs.com grade my server configuration.
grade is "T", because the cert is just a testing cert (this is expected).
grade would be "B", if it was a real trusted cert.
Issues found:
Certificate uses a weak signature (SHA1withRSA). When renewing, ensure you upgrade to SHA2.
Guess this needs to get fixed in the ACME server.
No HSTS (yet). Needs to get fixed in the client to optionally add this to the web server config.
In the end, HSTS enables "A+" grade.
