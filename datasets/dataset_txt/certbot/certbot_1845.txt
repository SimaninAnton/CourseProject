With the change of moving psutil as a dev extras dependency, our unit tests now fail when psutil isn't installed. This will likely be a problem for package maintainers/users who use our unit tests to make sure the package is working correctly on their system. We should either:
Move psutil back (temporarily) as a required dependency.
Fix our unit tests so they don't depend on the package.
