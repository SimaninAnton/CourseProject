I do understand that letsencrypt does not support issuance of certificates to a wildcard subdomain while other CA's might.
Since according to cerbots documentation you can point it to any CA i would appreciate if it would be possible to accept wildcard subdomain requests (i.e. through enabling a flag).
Thank you
