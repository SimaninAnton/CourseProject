If we get an unhandled exception during the renewal attempt, it doesn't crash the client but it does make renew() stop at that point. For example, try setting standalone_supported_challenges to an invalid value in a lineage's renewal configuration file, then running renew(). When it tries to renew that lineage, it will crash with an exception, and no subsequent lineages will be renewed. This is presumably the case with respect to every kind of unhandled exception that might occur for any reason.
