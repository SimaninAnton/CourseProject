Was doing some more webroot testing and ran into this error where http2ssl.xyz only had one SSL certificate issued back on october 27th around 23 days ago and a total of 10 certificates where issues between october 27th, 2015 and november 15th, 2015 - so which rate limit was hit ?

i see rate limits as https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/beta-program-announcements/1631
Rate limit on registrations per IP is now 10 per 3 hours up from 10 per day.
Rate limit on certificates per Name is now 10 per 59 days up from 6 per 59 days.
@bmw @jsha @pde so i git 10 per 59 days for all SSL certificates on *.http2ssl.xyz ? that means i can no longer do any testing for my whitelisted domain ?
I see I have 6x le10.http2ssl.xyz issued SSL certificates so hit the old rate limit ?
