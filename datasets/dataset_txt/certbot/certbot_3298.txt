When the configurator edits a config file, it normalizes all the whitespace in the file it outputs. This is confusing if you are used to editing your configs by hand, because it changes the visual appearance of the file. When I first ran the configurator, I was convinced that letsencrypt had completely overwritten my nginx.conf.
