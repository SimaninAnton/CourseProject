"""
I do think we need to do a better job of communicating the key's purpose and its abilities. Right now, every key-letsencrypt_*.pem key is technically an authorized (account) key within ACME... which will/can be different than the certificate key in the CSR. Perhaps we should write comments in the pem files themselves about the capabilities of the key.
Example:
Authorization valid until: XXXXX
This key is an ACME authorized key for the following names: example.com, foo.example.com
(This key is not known to be contained within any Let's Encrypt certificate)????
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
....
or
Authorization valid until: XXXXX
This key is an ACME authorized key for the following names: example.com, foo.example.com
This key is used in the certificate:
Issued at:
Issuer:
Domains:
Original filepath:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
This allows for a bit more flexibility and gives power users more info. Thoughts?

use (pretty formatted) json for the header, so it can be parsed automatically also.
