My RHEL 5 box is not able to actually fetch the certificates and the support issues raised don't seem to progress, so I am wondering if I can instead ( and only as a short term relieve ,or work-around, - get the SSL certs that will otherwise need to be bought - as the current ones expire in days )
RHEL 5 is also not suitable for runnig docker on it. So I am thinking of installing a small and simple linu distro that has enough SSL and python bits and pieces to allow me to interact with letsencrypt.org and fetch my new SSL certs to file?
What smallest or tiny linux distro would be guaranteed to work for this purpose?
