Since the Cloudflare plugin was written, Cloudflare has added support for API tokens with permissions a (slightly) smaller scope. For more information about this see #7252.
As pointed out in that thread at #7252 (comment), our Cloudflare plugin isn't very clear which kind of credentials it requires. While #7252 remains unresolved, we require the global API key so we should update the docs and CLI output to clarify this.
