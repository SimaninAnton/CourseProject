No installers seem to be present and working on your system; fix that or try running certbot with the "certonly" command
This is one of the most common messages, received when running certbot on an Nginx installation, but it is confusing to a new user. What's an installer? Is it my mistake or certbot's that there are no installers? What does "certonly" do?
Instead how about:
Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system. However, it can still get a certificate for you. Please run "certbot[-auto] certonly" to do so. You'll need to manually configure your web server to use the resulting certificate.
