While #6873 resolved #6813, test coverage is still not at 100% for the plugin. I think what happened is the TLS-SNI tests which have now been removed were also testing functions in other files so now we're missing a couple more lines of test coverage.
I think we should get test coverage on these lines and bump Apache required coverage back to 100%.
