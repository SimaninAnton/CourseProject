At https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/ubuntu-certbot-migration-for/110684/5, Osiris suggested that if we fail to find a field in a directory object, we should include the field we were looking for in the error message. I agree.
The value that should be included in the error message is the result of self._canon_key(name) as sometimes name is an ACME object rather than a string.
