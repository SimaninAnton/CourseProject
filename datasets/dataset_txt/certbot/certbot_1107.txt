In Nginx, say someone's done something like this:
server {
  server_name perfectly-good-name.com;
  listen 443 ssl;
  # ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.org/fullchain.pem;
  # ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.org/privkey.pem;
}
They know where the certs will live, so they've put in links to them, but Nginx needs real files there, so they comment them out.
But now the installer's going to fail, because we make the assumption that if someone has a server block with ssl enabled, we shouldn't add any ssl directives because we should try to leave things as much the same as possible.
I propose changing this assumption from an empirical perspective. People run into this all the time, so therefore it's the workflow that people expect should work. Therefore we should support it.
I'd love to hear any reasons why we didn't do this previously, or if we treat this differently in Apache.
