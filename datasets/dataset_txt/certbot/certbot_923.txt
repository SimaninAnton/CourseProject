My operating system is (include version):
Debian stable
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
yes
Manually, I use openssl to convert the pem into a .pfx / .p12 and then I import it manually with
http://keystore-explorer.org/ into a java keystore
Goal: if java is installed, the certbot should offer to do this automatically
