Trying to change the account recovery and expiry notification e-mail I get the following error:
Provided agreement URL [https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.0.1-July-27-2015.pdf] does not match current agreement URL [https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.1.1-August-1-2016.pdf]
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
Didn't find any clue at the log files.
