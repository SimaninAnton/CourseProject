My operating system is (include version):
macOS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
homebrew
I ran this command and it produced this output:
brew cleanup
Error: Directory not empty @ dir_s_rmdir - /usr/local/Cellar/certbot/0.25.1_1
Why is this directory not empty? Can I hard delete the directory without problems?
