I had installed the older version of certbot following the instructions for Debian 7 on... a debian 7 system. And I had generated some certificates which are working fine.
Then I upgraded to debian 8, so I deleted the old version of certbot, and I installed the new one via apt-get.
Now when I run certbot renew, I get this warning:
Attempting to parse the version 0.26.1 renewal configuration file found at /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.matteosistisette.com.conf with version 0.10.2 of Certbot. This might not work.
Of course it makes sense, but the error message should also tell me what I'm supposed to do to update the configuration file so that it's compatible with the new version and I stop getting this error.
