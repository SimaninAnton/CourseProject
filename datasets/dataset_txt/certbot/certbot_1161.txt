In their 1.6.1 release, Sphinx started requiring the package latexmk when trying to make PDFs of docs using the Makefile target latexpdf. This would be fine, but it also came with a change in behavior for us.
Apparently, Sphinx does not support SVGs when building PDFs (see sphinx-doc/sphinx#1907). Previously, this would be silent error and our documentation would just build without the SVG images. Now it's a hard error and causes the build to fail.
While it's nice that we're now aware of the problem, it has broken our tests on the https://github.com/certbot/website repo. I'm going to pin Sphinx<=1.5.6 until this issue has either been resolved by us or upstream. This problem only affects the Certbot package and the problem is the badges in the Certbot README.
