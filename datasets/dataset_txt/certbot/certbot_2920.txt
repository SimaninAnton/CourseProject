If running anything but (Currently) Apache on Debian, letsencrypt command will give one of the errors in cli.py:
msg = ('No installers seem to be present and working on your system; ' 'fix that or try running letsencrypt with the "certonly" command')
msg = ('No installers are available on your OS yet; try running ' '"letsencrypt-auto certonly" to get a cert you can install manually')
I think the message is not clear as it is using the term "Installers" which might not be immediately apparent to be a cert installer. I'm not the only one who got confused by it, for example:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/no-installers-seem-to-be-present-and-working-on-your-system/1791
I suggest changing it to something like:
"No certificate installers were found on your system. Fix that or run letsencrypt with the "certonly" command to get a certificate and install in manually."
Also the second message says "letsencrypt-auto" which as far as I understand is the "pre release" name? Feel free to correct me on this and I'll update the Pull Request.
