I am running Debian testing amd64 with apache2. Having cloned the git repo (currently 8bfda79), and having run './letsencrypt-auto --help all' which led to a number of dependencies being installed, running 'letsencrypt-auto --apache' fails as follows:
fpr@xen:~/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto --apache
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: sudo /home/fpr/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache
An unexpected error occurred:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
The log is here.
