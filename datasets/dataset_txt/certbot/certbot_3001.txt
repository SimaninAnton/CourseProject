Here's the installer failure I got on OSX:

Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
Warning: It appears you have MacPorts or Fink installed.
Software installed with other package managers causes known problems for
Homebrew. If a formula fails to build, uninstall MacPorts/Fink and try again.

==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, so it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Mac OS X already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include


If you need Python to find the installed site-packages:
  mkdir -p ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
  echo '/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/python2.7/site-packages' >> ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth

######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring readline-6.2.4.mavericks.bottle.2.tar.gz
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, so it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
