Right now we have this comment in tests/boulder-fetch.sh:
# Check out special branch until latest docker changes land in Boulder master.
git clone -b docker-integration https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder $BOULDERPATH
I believe those changes have landed. However, deleting that -b docker-integration leads to Travis failures: https://travis-ci.org/jsha/certbot/builds/168435605. We should debug them and possibly remove that -b.
