The DuplicativeCertsTest test class tests certbot.main._find_duplicative_certs but it imports a test class from storage_tests.py for its setup. It would be nice to avoid this dependency. It might be possible to the use make_lineage function (it is somewhere in certbot.tests) to do this. Or maybe a different refactoring strategy is necessary.
There is more discussion about this here.
Anything to add @ohemorange ?
