The renewer script is most commonly meant to run from cron, and that's the feature set that I've provided for so far (trying to make decisions automatically in an unattended fashion).
There is an /etc/letsencrypt/renewer.conf which can provide defaults to decide whether autorenewal and autodeployment are enabled or disabled, when renewal and deployment should happen, and other topics. To control the behavior of the renewer when run in unattended mode, that file should be edited.
I haven't considered what kind of command-line options we might want to have for the case where the user runs the renewer script manually (for example, to try to renew one particular lineage).
