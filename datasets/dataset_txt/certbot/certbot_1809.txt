Imagine the following scenario (which happened to a user). You've successfully completed your challenges from Let's Encrypt and you're renewing your certificates. After saving all four of cert.pem, privkey.pem, chain.pem, and fullchain.pem to /etc/letsencrypt/archive, you hit ctrl+C. Your symlinks in /etc/letsencrypt/live were never updated.
When you run certbot renew again, Certbot will tell your certificate is not due for renewal. This is because we currently check the expiration of the newest entry in /etc/letsencrypt/archive that has all four of the files listed above (source). We do not check the symlink.
There are a number of ways to fix this, but this is a pretty bad bug and should be resolved before we release 0.9.0.
