Hi, I follow the instructions here: https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html
and run:
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 443:443 --name letsencrypt \
            -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
            quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest
Then a "This is a preview release ... [Agree]" dialog appears, and after that, there's an error message:
Configurator could not be determined
and then the Docker container exits, does nothing. I added the option --help and then tested --authenticator standalone --installer nginx and --nginx and --apache â€” but nothing seems to work.
Is the read-the-docs Docker docs out of date? Or is there some other problem? Or am I missing something?
(not sure if you prefer issues like this to be posted here or at https://community.letsencrypt.org?)
Best regards, KajMagnus
