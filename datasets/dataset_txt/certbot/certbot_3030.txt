Running with --webroot-path and umask 0027 creates .well-known/acme-challenge/... with no global read permissions, causing the verification to fail because the HTTP server can't read the files (at least not in my setup).
Either overriding permissions during/after creation or making the directories and challenge file have similar permissions as the webroot itself should probably work in most cases.
