When I started to port Certbot on Windows, a lot of unit tests or the logic tested by them were not working on this platform.
In order to still have a working CI during the port, all failing tests where marked with a temporary decorator, @broken_on_windows to skip their execution. At this time, there is 40 units tests left in this state.
This issue is done to track the complete removal of broken tests on Windows, either by fix the test or code logic, or by skipping definitively some of theses tests for a good reason with @skip_on_windows.
