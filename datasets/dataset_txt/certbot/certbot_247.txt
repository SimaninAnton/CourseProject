--help parameter does not show the ability to get the version number of cerbot with --version parameter.
It's probably nice to document it for beginners.
The patch would be trivial by modifying lines around:
certbot/certbot/cli.py
Line 114 in 36c8a45
   -h, --help [TOPIC]    print this message, or detailed help on a topic; 
I installed the cerbot package provided by stretch-backports as said by the documentation (https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianstretch-apache).
$ certbot --version
certbot 0.28.0
