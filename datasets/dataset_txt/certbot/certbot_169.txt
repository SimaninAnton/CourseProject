If we don't kill certbot-auto with #5884, I think we should rewrite certbot-auto to use Python over shell scripts as much as possible.
We may not be able to completely escape shell scripting though. If we cannot, I think we should take ideas from http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/ and apply them in certbot-auto. We already use set -e, but set -u would have prevented #7031.
While I like set -o pipefail, I don't think it is POSIX compliant. We could also look into setting IFS.
