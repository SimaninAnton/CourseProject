Vulcand is a reverse proxy which stores its configuration in etcd.
It can be configured without restarting either using a REST api or etcd directly.
URL: https://vulcand.io/
The process would look like this
lets-encrypt regulary checks etcd for new hosts in /vulcand/hosts
it generates and sets the ssl key, automatically adds a new frontend/backend to map to letsencrypt
requests certificate issuance
installs new certificate
Instead of duplicating too much, a docker container running apache could be used and only some additional calls to update the certificates/backend/frontend would be neeaded.
This idea of this issue is to track progress on such an implementation to avoid duplicate effort.
