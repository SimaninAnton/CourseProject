If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or

$ docker run -it --rm certbot/certbot:v0.30.2 certbot-auto --help all

Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
