The OOM killed the certbot installer (probably during python configuration) on my VPS. At one time, the VPS crashed and I had to reboot the VPS. I am using the Blueberry plan: https://www.berry.pw/
It's time to redesign certboot using less bloated software. The tool should be designed as a native C program.
