The Revoker class needs an overhaul. It needs to be compatible without an Installer, and it isn't handling all of the errors as well as it could be. For instance, since the code cleanup, it isn't handling IOErrors which occur when bad paths are given to certificate files.
It could also use some code cleanup.
get_all_certs_keys returns locations found in sites-available (within Apache). I think that this is probably the correct functionality (find all of the possibly installed certificates), but the revoker must deal with the errors.
