Hi,
I was trying to install letsencrypt on my debian 7.10, installation was OK, but when launching lestencrypt --apache, I was having :
./letsencrypt-auto --apache
Checking for new version...
Requesting root privileges to run letsencrypt...
   /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: NotSupportedError('Apache plugin support requires libaugeas0 and augeas-lenses version 1.2.0 or higher, please make sure you have you have those installed.',)
After installing lsb_release (apt-get install lsb-release) and reinstalling letsencrypt, I now can run and install my certs.
perhaps on some OS, lsb_relase should be a dependency ?
Thank you for your work!
