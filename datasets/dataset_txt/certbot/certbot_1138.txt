My operating system is (include version):
ubuntu 16.10
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I misconfigured my DNS zone, my A record pointed to the wrong IP.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I got
Domain: yourdoma.in
Type:   unknownHost
Detail: No valid IP addresses found for yourdoma.in

To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain contain(s) the right IP address.
This message suggests that the DNS lookup failed while in fact it didn't. Would be more useful if it said something like Type: notReachable
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
