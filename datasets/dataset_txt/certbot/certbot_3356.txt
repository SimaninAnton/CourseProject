Steps to reproduce:
letsencrypt
Follow prompts, when selecting which web server to use, Apache has "- alpha" after it, but Nginx does not. Nginx support is far less mature than Apache. I've heard about from two other people (and experienced myself) a failure to complete an issuance flow. I think we should probably remove the alpha tag from Apache and add it to Nginx. Or perhaps temporarily disable Nginx support, since it seems to be broken for a number of people?
