I tried to script some things and I have 5 subdomains .. when I found that when i do
letsencrypt-auto certonly -d subd1 -d subd2 -d subd3 ..
after the process completed, I only had a cert for subd1.
Unless I am missing something, that seems like a bug. I tried to find it here to see if it's open already, however, a quick search did not seem to indicate this was known already.
