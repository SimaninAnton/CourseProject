For acme (and josepy), I'd say everything is public (besides objects prefixed with an underscore).
For the plugins, I'd say nothing is public besides the plugin API they implement.
For certbot, this is less clear. Everything in achallenges.py, errors.py, and interfaces.py should probably be considered public. Additionally, maybe some combination of certbot/plugins/common.py, certbot/crypto_util.py, and certbot/util.py?
We should clearly document this for people wanting to hack on/around the probject.
