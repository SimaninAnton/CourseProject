The domain ddns.net is being rate limited, which seems weird to me since it's part of a large dynamic DNS provider (no-ip.com).
An unexpected error occurred.
Error: rateLimited :: There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: ddns.net
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
Can ddns.net be limit free?
