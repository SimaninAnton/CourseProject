My operating system is: Amazon Linux 4.4.51-40.58.amzn1.x86_64
I tried to install certbot using the official instructions for RHEL7 as that appeared to be most similar to Amazon Linux.
I ran yum install python-certbot-apache and it produced this output:
Loaded plugins: priorities, update-motd, upgrade-helper amzn-main/latest | 2.1 kB 00:00 amzn-updates/latest | 2.3 kB 00:00 epel/x86_64/metalink | 11 kB 00:00 epel-debuginfo/x86_64/metalink | 9.5 kB 00:00 epel-source/x86_64/metalink | 10 kB 00:00 989 packages excluded due to repository priority protections No package python-certbot-apache available. Error: Nothing to do
After reading #3970 and #3257 I suspected that there was a problem with epel but it appears to be working properly.

I also tried python2-certbot-apache with the same results.
