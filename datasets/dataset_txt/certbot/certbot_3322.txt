There are no installers in the standard distribution apart from null.Installer, which is hidden from the UI. So, if you remove letsencrypt-apache and letsencrypt-nginx, letsencrypt -a standalone (or more explicitly letsencrypt -a standalone run) will fail to find a candidate plugin for installer without any sensible warnings. This is behavior is confusing. Maybe default verb should be auth if no installers are available?
