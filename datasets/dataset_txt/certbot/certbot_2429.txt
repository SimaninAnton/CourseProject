Right now, if you do service apache2 stop in the hope of renewing standalone lineages, but the renewer decides to renew any installer=apache lineage, the renewer will call .restart() which will then cause apache2 to start again! That, in turn, will cause TCP ports to be in use and standalone to be unable to renew its lineages.
The apache plugin should not actually "reload" a non-running Apache; there's arguably no need to do so because the new cert, if any, will be picked up automatically the next time that Apache is started.
