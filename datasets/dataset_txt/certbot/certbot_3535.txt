If the CA has many (/any) users with no email on file, it's going to cause a lot of hassles. We're still deciding if we want it to be official policy that everyone has to provide an email, but in the meantime we can work on the client side of this. Proposal: The interactive version of the client should ask for an email, and not proceed without one, unless it was invoked with a --allow-unsafe-registration. The help documentation for --allow-unsafe-registration would say:
"Specifying this flag enables registering an account with no email address. This is strongly discouraged, because in the event of key loss or account compromise you will irrevocably lose access to your account. You will also be unable to receive notice about impending expiration of revocation of your certificates. Updates to the Subscriber Agreement will still affect you, and the CA will make a best-effort attempt to notify you about them based on information about the affected domains, such as WHOIS data and common administrative addresses."
