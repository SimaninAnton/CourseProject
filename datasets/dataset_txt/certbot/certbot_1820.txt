OS X 10.11.6 with latest Macports installed.
Cerbot scripts are unable to install python via MacPorts.
echo "Installing python..."
Error: Port python not found
This concerns following files:
certbot-auto:   
letsencrypt-auto:   
letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto
letsencrypt-auto-source/pieces/bootstrappers/mac.sh
This happens because sudo port install python returns Error: Port python not found. My workaround is to replace $pkgcmd python with $pkgcmd python27
I am not sure if sudo port install python is suposed to work and something is broken on MacPorts side.
