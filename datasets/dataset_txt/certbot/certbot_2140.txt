Hello,
I'm running
./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a manual --rsa-key-size 4096 -d my.sub.domain.com
which points to an ubuntu vm that i'm running at home.
I execute the shell that letsencrypt writes in the shell (with root user), and the url works both in browser and with curl -i, but letsencrypt keeps returning an error:
Failed authorization procedure. my.sub.domain.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to http://my.sub.domain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/foo
Domain: my.sub.domain.com
Type: connection
Detail: Could not connect to http://my.sub.domain.com
/.well-known/acme-
challenge/foo
with -vvvv I get the following msgs:
dns-01 was not recognized, full message: {u'status': u'pending',
u'token': u'V0qLMBvMjb6nbWBbi5NkRt3Iy79Fbu-4w6Pb39Q1_g4', u'type':

Can it be because the dns didn't yet propogate to letsencrypt servers, and even though the link works on computers in my vicinity, it isn't yet registered there?
