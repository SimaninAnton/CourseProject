This has come up a number of times on Let's Encrypt's community forum (see https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/failed-authorization-procedure-connection-refused/45134 and https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/standalone-certonly-http-01-insufficient-authorization/47148). We need to document how our standalone plugin attempts to automatically handle both IPv4 and IPv6 as well as how you can use --<challenge-type>-address flags to control which interface (and protocol) Certbot binds to.
