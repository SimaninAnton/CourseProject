My operating system is (include version):
Linux Debian
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The certificate is extended, but I still get a reminder email about expiry with an incorrect date.
