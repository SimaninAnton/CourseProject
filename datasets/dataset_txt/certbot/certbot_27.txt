I have a certificate which in the past week I have added more domains.
Today I received an email from expiry@letsencrypt.org, saying:
Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 9 days (on 13 Dec 19 04:15 +0000).
However, certbot-auto certificates tells me that that certificate has
Expiry Date: 2020-01-31 12:20:15+00:00 (VALID: 58 days)
It looks like the email source hasn't updated the certificate expiration date the last time a domain was added to it (and the certificate was therefore renewed).
