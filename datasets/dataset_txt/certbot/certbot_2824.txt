My website is hosted on a shared server. I don't have root on it. Can I use letsencrypt?
I tried installing letsencrypt-auto following https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#installation
ham@pandora:~/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto
Bootstrapping dependencies for Debian-based OSes...
[sudo] password for ham:
ham is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
The user guide is confusing:
Please do not attempt the installation commands as superuser/root
