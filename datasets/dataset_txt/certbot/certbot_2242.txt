Currently, it's possible to do pip install letsencrypt-apache and get a copy of the client. But there are many things that can go wrong:
OS level dependencies can be missing, causing the client to error out
pip won't upgrade any packages that are provided by the OS, but at the wrong version, so various python API errors will occur in that case
For these reasons, we currently don't officially support pip install letsencrypt, but people try it anyway. It would probably be good to go through, catch all the exceptions that happen for the reasons above, and print helpful error messages ("you need openssl installed"; "your version of python-cryptography is less than X", etc) in each case.
I don't think the core team will have time for this, but it's a pretty self-contained task that a volunteer might be able to take on.
