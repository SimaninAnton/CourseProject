Comments and empty lines in nginx config files are deleted after running the configurator because the nginxparser module ignores them.
Augeas, which does preserve comments, has a wiki page about handling this: https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Dealing-with-comments
I think the simplest thing is to create a "node" for each comment line/block.
