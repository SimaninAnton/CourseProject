If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
debian buster 10.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
I install certbot with pip3
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/usr/local/bin/certbot certonly --dns-ovh --dns-ovh-credentials /root/.ovhapi --non-interactive --agree-tos --email me@email.fr -d domain.tld (OK)
/usr/local/bin/certbot certonly --dns-ovh --dns-ovh-credentials /root/.ovhapi --non-interactive --agree-tos --email me@email.fr -d *.domain.tld -->Failed
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates. By default, it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the certificate. certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: dl.domain.tld ipv6.domain.tld misc.domain.tld scontent.domain.tld
(probably) Cause: By the past, I manually add the domains (and uninstall certbot before delete him)
I also reinstall the system
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
