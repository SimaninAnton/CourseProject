If you run letsencrypt auth for an Apache virtual host that doesn't have SSL enabled, the Apache plugin creates a new vhost *-le-ssl.conf. After performing the challenges, the plugin's cleanup function is called but it doesn't remove the created vhosts. Instead, the user has to run letsencrypt again and the files will be deleted up when recovery_routine is called. These temporary files should be removed during the cleanup function.
