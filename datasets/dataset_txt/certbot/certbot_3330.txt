I'm using VestaCP control panel. I have four files from letsencrypt:
# ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/<my.domain.com>
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 38 жов  1 17:21 cert.pem -> ../../archive/<my.domain.com>/cert1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 жов  1 17:21 chain.pem -> ../../archive/<my.domain.com>/chain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 43 жов  1 17:21 fullchain.pem -> ../../archive/<my.domain.com>/fullchain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 41 жов  1 17:21 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/<my.domain.com>/privkey1.pem
I got them through letsencrypt auth and standalone authentifacator (standalone) for my.domain.com and www.my.domain.com (space separated).
I took cert.pem and write it in SSL Certificate field on control panel
I took privkey.pem and write it in SSL Key field on control panel
I took CA from https://letsencrypt.org/2015/06/04/isrg-ca-certs.html and write it in SSL Certificate Authority / Intermediate field on control panel (I tried all three CA and chain.pem and fullchain.pem)
But in all this cases cert is not trusted on browsers (Chrome, Firefox)
What I'm doing wrong?
