Let's Encrypt has an option to set all the pages on a Web server to redirect to HTTPS from HTTP. When this option is used, it makes sense to automatically add corresponding rules to HTTPS Everywhere in order to help securing the site from an attempt to drop HTTPS at the first redirect.
Integration of that sort between two important and valuable EFF concepts tends to help in promoting both products and securing the Internet communications, doesn't it? :-)
