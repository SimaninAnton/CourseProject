Hi, i'm having a strange issue.
I have several domains on one VDS server.
1. aviabroker.ru
2. vremiatour.com
Historically domain aviabroker.ru is oldest domain on this server, but i'm in middle of launching second domain, and here is the question.
When i'm accessing second domain vremiatour.com, thats what i see in certificate specification.
When i'm accessing aviabroker.ru its all fine obviously.
BUT, if i will regenerate my certificate without aviabroker.ru domain in it, i'm receiving certificate error when i'm trying to access vremiatour.com
I'm guessing, its something about IP<>domain dns history, but not sure where to dig.
Please advise something.
P.S. I'm using this command to generate certs.
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos --webroot -w /srv/vremiatour.com -d vremiatour.com -d www.vremiatour.com -w /srv/aviabroker.ru/ -d aviabroker.ru -d www.aviabroker.ru â€”text
