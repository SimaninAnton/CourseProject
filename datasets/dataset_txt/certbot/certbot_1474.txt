On a centos 7 server, letsencrypt-auto issues the following traceback when running via cron to perform a check if cert is due to renew:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Cert seems to be successfully renewed when due for renewal, but each time the cron job runs, I get an email from CRON with the output above...
