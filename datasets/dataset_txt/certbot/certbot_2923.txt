Make letsencrypt-auto use PyPI (where we'll put our dev releases from now on), a signed requirements file, and peep.
Prereq: #1571.
letsencrypt-auto will go figure out what the latest version of LE is (from PyPI (look at the version key in the first dict) or GH--over HTTPS to make it harder to artificially keep LE out of date) then wget that version's reqs.txt and signature off GH.
It'll verify the sig with openssl (already in the bootstrap scripts and easy to airgap sigs for).
Then it'll peep install that reqs.txt into the venv.
