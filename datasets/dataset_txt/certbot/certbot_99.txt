If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It seems the certbot package is no longer being distributed for Ubuntu 14.04 in the certbot/certbot PPA. I just wanted to confirm that this is true.
Here is further proof that, at least for me, the package no longer exists
grep ^Package /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_certbot_certbot_ubuntu_dists_trusty_main_binary-amd64_Packages 
outputs:
Package: python-cookies
Package: python3-cookies
