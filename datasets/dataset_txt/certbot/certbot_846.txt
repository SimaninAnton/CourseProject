My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 6.9
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I ran sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --nginx
And it got most of the way through until it came here:
/opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cryptography/init.py:2 6: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team , please upgrade your Python. A future version of cryptography will drop support for Python 2.6
DeprecationWarning
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
The nginx plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing config uration.
The error was: NoInstallationError()
I installed Python 3.5 and it produced the exact same output
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I did not expect there to be an error from running the certbot-auto command
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
