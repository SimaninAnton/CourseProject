I've just created a new certificate for my domain using certbot in manual mode.
The resulting private key file is world-readable.
Below steps show how to reproduce:
$ certbot certonly --manual
<follow instructions>
After certificate has been generated successfully:
ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 46 Nov  5 09:56 /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem -> ../../archive/<domain>/privkey1.pem

ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<domain>/privkey1.pem 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1704 Nov  5 09:56 /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<domain>/privkey1.pem
This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the live and archive directories are not world-readable or executable by default. However, I believe there is benefit to having the file itself not be world-readable as a defense-in-depth measure.
Version used: certbot 0.9.3
Command line: certbot certonly --manual
