My operating system is (include version):
AWS -Amazon Linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
I ran this command and it produced this output:
letsencrypt-auto --debug
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Requesting to rerun ./letsencrypt-auto with root privileges...
Another instance of Certbot is already running.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
1-58-100 letsencrypt]$ ./letsencrypt-auto --debug
Requesting to rerun ./letsencrypt-auto with root privileges...
Bootstrapping dependencies for Amazon... (you can skip this with --no-bootstrap)
