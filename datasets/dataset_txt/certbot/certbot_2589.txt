I tried to install a certificate using the command
letsencrypt-auto --apache --email x@abc.com --text --agree-tos --rsa-key-size 4096 -d domain.name
I still see it is waiting for input. Is there a completely silent option ? I did not see any option to completely suppress any interaction. I am looking to write script that will be called from a web application, which means I would need a silent option that just returns an error and not wait for any user input. I checked the --help all, did not find any option. Any pointer is highly appreciated or suggest if this feature can be included. Thanks in advance.
