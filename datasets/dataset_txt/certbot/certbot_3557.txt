So, Freeola... GoDaddy... all those hosting companies host websites for millions of people.
But often, they do not offer SSH access to the actual servers themselves. Or if they do - they ban installation of software (Gandi Simple hosting does this)
Its great for people with their own web servers on AWS to sudo apt-get and lets-encrypt but for users of the provided hosting companies, will you provide a solution for them? Otherwise how will you ever manage to get 100% of the web encrypted! Millions of those sites exist...
My initial thoughts are
DNS based validation
Ability to use above to generate certs on local PC using lets-encrypt and then upload to hosting company who accepts cert files
Maybe even some say a web client on your website to use DNS validation for users who are not comfortable with command line?
I can't wait for your product myself as it seems I am the target audience (bunch of client websites all on servers I 100% control) --- but I do feel for the smaller companies and individuals who pay for managed hosting and cannot get full server control but do have full domain control and ability to upload certs to their provider.
I'm just keen to know if you intent to help this use case?
