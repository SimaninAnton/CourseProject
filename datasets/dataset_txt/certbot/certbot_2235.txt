If you try to put up a multi-domain cert (with certonly and webroot), for
example.com
www.example.com
cdn.example.com
www.cdn.example.com
And www.cdn.example.com don't have a A-record, you get an error saying that the there was a DNS timeout for example.com.
Expected behavior:
Report that there was a DNS error with www.cdn.example.com
Current behavior:
its removing the subdomain part (www.cdn),
or its just reporting the first domain name in the list (example.com)
