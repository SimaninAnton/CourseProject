If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Coreos
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
docker image
I ran this command and it produced this output:
docker run -it --name certbot certbot/certbot:latest
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system. However, it can still get a certificate for you. Please run "certbot certonly" to do so. You'll need to manually configure your web server to use the resulting certificate.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected the new container to still be active, but it seems like after running and finishing the command process it shuts down the container. I understand that is how docker works, what I want to know is how to pass commands to the container without having to use docker run all the time. Since it shuts down immediately there isn't enough time to use docker exec.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
