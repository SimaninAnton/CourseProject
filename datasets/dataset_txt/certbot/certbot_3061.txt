Hi,
We're running very tight firewalls on our machines and would appreciate if the following error message would state what IPs to allow traffic from:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following 'connection' errors were reported by the server:

   Domains: domain.tld
   Error: The server could not connect to the client for DV

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
   your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
   firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
   client.
We have no trouble allowing traffic to the paths needed for DV, but I would prefer to not have to guess what IPs Letsencrypt is using.
Thanks for your consideration
