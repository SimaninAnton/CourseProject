My operating system is (include version):
Distributor ID: Debian
Description: Debian GNU/Linux 8.10 (jessie)
Release: 8.10
Codename: jessie
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
docker
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo docker run -it --rm --name certbot -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" certbot/certbot certonly --manual --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
Gave
ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /directory (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f53a1d351d0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Try again',))
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It does not point to https://letsencrypt.status.io/ to help demonstrate that this is a scheduled downtime
Hi,
I am finding cerbot invaluable for my small server cluster and am transitioning all my certs to using it (thanks!). In particular, I need a wildcard cert so have been using docker with the v2 acme server. When I was transitioning to another server at May 9, 2018 11:28EST there is a planned maintenance (May 9, 2018 14:46 UTC[Update] We are starting our datacenter upgrades and maintenance. Staging will be offline and unavailable during this time. Production services will be fully available.) causing (I assume) this HTTPS connection error. I understand that scheduled maintenance is rare but, similar to #4535 I think the error message could be improved.
I am happy to work on the PR if this seems like a good fit
