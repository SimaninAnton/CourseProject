hi,
My operating system is (include version):
Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ /etc/scripts/certbot-auto --version
certbot 0.35.0
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected certbot-auto to update certbot to 0.35.1
