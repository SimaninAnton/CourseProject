If an automated renewal happens and isn't followed relatively soon by an automated deployment, the current renewer might think that another automated renewal should happen (because the currently deployed cert is still out of date), and perform 2 or more renewals prior to deployment. The criteria for automated renewal need to be improved to prevent this from happening.
One likely solution for this would be to examine the expiry time not only of the currently-deployed cert, but of each of its successors (if any exist in the lineage).
