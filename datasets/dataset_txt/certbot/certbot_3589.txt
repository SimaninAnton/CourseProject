In order to be more DRY (reduce maintenance burden), how about a bootstrap/ubuntu/trusty.sh script with all necessary apt-gets? We would call it from travis.yml, from Dockerfile (#297) and tell people to use it for installation in using.rst.
Obviously, we could have similar bootstrap scripts for other platforms.
