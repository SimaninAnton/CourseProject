I have tried specifying the list both with and without spaces after the commas, but it seems that certbot-auto only creates a cert for the first entry.
Furthermore, it would seem that even if one specifies an alternative cli.ini to the default one in /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini, the latter is still consulted, which shows itselv with the domain list being seen by certbot-auto -c renew complaining that it can only renew all, not a list...
