My operating system is (include version):
linux alpine edge
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
pip install certbot==0.12.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I created /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini listing all options, even if they matched the default:
# /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini

authenticator = webroot
webroot-path = /srv
dry-run = False
# ...
Command:
$ certbot certonly
Output:
<snip>
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The dry run was successful
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expect setting a boolean option to True would be the same as setting the flag:
dry-run = True
certbot certonly --dry-run -d example.com
I expect setting a boolean option to False would be the same as omitting the flag:
dry-run = False
certbot certonly -d example.com
The boolean flags were set regardless of whether they were True or False. The option just needs to be present in the configuration file.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
