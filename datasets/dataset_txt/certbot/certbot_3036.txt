When running letsencrypt-auto using the recommended parameters on Ubuntu 14.04LTS, the script successfully installs its dependencies, but soon stops with this failure:
Creating virtual environment...
Traceback (most recent call last):

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

I manually upgraded virtualenv with pip, but that only took it to v13.1.2 from v13.1.0, not the required 13.2.0.dev0. Python version currently installed is 3.4.3. I then updated the virtualenv installed for Python 2.7.6 on this system using pip2, and the script was able to complete. It would seem that despite letsencrypt-auto checking Python3 by default, it is expecting to only work with Python2?
