I've got a server running Debian squeeze with Python upgraded to 2.7 (I don't use python and don't remember what I needed the upgrade for, but now it's too late and apt-get won't let me downgrade without uninstalling dozens of seemingly unrelated packages that I actually need).
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
python-dev : Depends: python (= 2.6.6-3+squeeze7) but 2.7.3-4+deb7u1 is to be installed
Depends: python2.6-dev (>= 2.6.6-1~) but it is not going to be installed
python2.7 : Breaks: python-virtualenv (< 1.7.1.2-2~) but 1.4.9-3squeeze1 is to be installed
E: Broken packages
That's just FYI. My server is probably bust. I'll try the nodejs client :)
