Suppose a user runs LE and it modifies the file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.conf``. The user then also modifies this file and at some point in the future the user tries to rollback back to the state before running LE for the first time. In this case, the users changes are lost.
Perhaps we could do something by comparing the values for mtime, but this is tricky as changes are registered with the reverter before they occur. There's not a lot we can do here, but I expect this behavior will be frustrating for some users. I'm just creating this issue for tracking purposes.
