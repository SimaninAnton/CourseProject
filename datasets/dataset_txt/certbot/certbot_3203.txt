In CentOS7 (and presumably other RPM/RHEL-based systems), the tool fails to detect the Apache installation on the system, which I believe to be due to it looking for the install at /etc/apache2, instead of the Cent/RHEL default of /etc/httpd.
The directory layout, for reference, on my Cent box is:
[root@drop3 ~]# find /etc/httpd/ -type d
/etc/httpd/
/etc/httpd/conf
/etc/httpd/conf.d
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d
the conf folder holds httpd.conf (global).
conf.d holds vhost or module-specific configs
conf.modules.d holds LoadModule statements.
Kuba created #1092 as a byproduct of this w.r.t. a "bad" failure message here.
Happy to test any fixes, and I'm going to look into it myself, as well.
