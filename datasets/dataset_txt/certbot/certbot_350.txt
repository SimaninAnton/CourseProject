Hey,
Lexicon's internal configuration system will be changing soon, once AnalogJ/lexicon#302 is merged.
@adferrand's PR reorganizes and refactors a not-insignificant portion of the lexicon engine and adds a much more robust config storage solution based on node's nconf library.
His changes are backwards compatible when lexicon where possible, however there may be some issues for projects using lexicon as a library due to class/function refactoring.
Since you guys use lexicon as a library, I wanted to give you a heads up incase there's any changes in your integration/test suite you need to prepare.
Timeline for merging the PR is next couple of days unless there are any concerns.
