My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Developer instructions
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I extracted these files into the sites-available directory in Apache, ran certbot --apache --redirect and selected all domains.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The only redirect was created in example.conf which is incorrect. I believe there's an issue with vhost selection here where the *.example.org is being used despite there being a vhost with a ServerName/ServerAlias directive with the specific name we're trying to enable a redirect for.
