My operating system is (include version):
Debian GNU/Linux buster/sid, kernel 5.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot 0.32.0 via PyPi
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Tried to use Configparser Python module (actually, a dependency of the "INI" file lookup in Ansible) to open configs in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/*conf and extract values from keys.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
This does not work due to:
Error: 'File contains no section headers.'
Even though I'm trying to read hooks from the [renewalparams] section.
The file usually begins with version = or a comment instead of a section header.
Can you make this conform to ordinary INI format by making a [global] section header at the top?
