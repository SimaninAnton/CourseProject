In my go daddy account I created A record for subdomain and point to i.p address of my google compute engine . in my GCE or google compute engine i createad server block because I am using nginx. my subdomain is working fine now I decided to install letetsencrypt and I use certbot. when I followed the tutorial issuing this command
./certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/project -d mysubdomain.mydomain.com --non-interactive --agree-tos --email mygmail@gmail.com
after I hit enter it says
Failed authorization procedure. mysubdomain.mydomain.com (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Could not connect to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
can I used letsencrypt in GCE ?
