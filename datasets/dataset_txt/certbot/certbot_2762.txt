During the closed beta, I created a certificate for use by a non-webserver using letsencrypt-auto; the --cert-path option was honoured. When renewing (during open beta), the --cert-path was ignored.
Is this semantic confusion over the interaction between certonly and --cert-path during renewal? I expected that locations where artifacts were placed during install would also be touched during update. Anything else I should be doing?
I've obfuscated only the closed-beta URL.
./letsencrypt-auto certonly \
    --server $closed_beta_url --agree-dev-preview \
    -a standalone -d demo.nats.io --cert-path /etc/nats/tls
Renewal was with the same command but with --server and --agree-dev-previews options dropped.
Notably, the original --cert-path has generation numbers in the filenames for the placed certs, the same generation numbers which were updated by this renewal.
I would naively expect the contents of --cert-path to look very like the contents of /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.nats.io except with files instead of symlinks.
