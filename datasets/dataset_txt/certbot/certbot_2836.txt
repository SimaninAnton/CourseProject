I am using amazon cloudfront cdn and new i wanted to use my custom domain name. So, I jave created a CNAME for a subdomain and pointed it to CloudFront domain.
I tried to register my domain with letsencrypt and got the following error.
Command:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a standalone -d peeljobs.com -d www.peeljobs.com -d cdn.peeljobs.com --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-dev-preview
Error:
 - The following 'urn:acme:error:unauthorized' errors were reported by
   the server:

   Domains: cdn.peeljobs.com
   Error: The client lacks sufficient authorization
