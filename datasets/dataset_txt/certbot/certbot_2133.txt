Dear Letsencrypt Team.
I need to install an SSL to "xn--q3cblu9dn4n.com" but didn't support.
I run a command line with /opt/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto --apache -d xn--q3cblu9dn4n.com -d www.xn--q3cblu9dn4n.com after the terminal display a message "Punycode domains are not presently supported: xn--q3cblu9dn4n.com"
PS. A domain "xn--q3cblu9dn4n.com" is same "พระบ้าน.com". I'm registered in Thailand.
Thanks.
