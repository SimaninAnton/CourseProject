My operating system is (include version):
Gentoo, profile 13.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager "Portage".
I ran this command and it produced this output:
`certbot certonly`
How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
1: Apache Web Server plugin - Beta (apache)
2: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
3: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
Select the appropriate number [1-3] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The manual plugin is missing.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.

Manually selecting the manual plugin with -a manual works like a charm.. Expected behaviour: possibility to choose the manual plugin without specifying -a.
