It is requested that an optional flag be available to allow it to assume that the current account has the appropriate access to the needed areas and never request for SUDO/elevation, just do not even test for it.
So that for people that want to set the appropriate permissions manually and add things to the appropriate groups, they do not need to give the cron automatic access to root. This allows those that want to tighten their system for least privilege can do so.
