My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git checkout of version 0.19.0, letsecnrypt-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/letsencrypt-auto certonly --post-hook=service nginx reload --no-self-upgrade --webroot -w /var/www/letsencrypt -d production.ldt.mashbodev.com -d reallyabsurdlystupidlylongdomainnamethatisdefinitelygoingtobeoverthe63characterlimitbloodyhellthisislongchillyourbeansman.mashbodev.com
Requested domain reallyabsurdlystupidlylongdomainnamethatisdefinitelygoingtobeoverthe63characterlimitbloodyhellthisislongchillyourbeansman.mashbodev.com is not a FQDN because label reallyabsurdlystupidlylongdomainnamethatisdefinitelygoingtobeoverthe63characterlimitbloodyhellthisislongchillyourbeansman is too long.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Other tickets discussions have indicated that long domain names +64 characters can be validated as domains by including them as alternative subject names instead of the common name. Also, isn't certbot supposed to take the first domain as the common name? In this case production.ldt.mashbodev.com ? Which is under 64 characters and should be fine?
