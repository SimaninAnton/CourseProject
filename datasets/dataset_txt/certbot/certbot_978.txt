I'm a Homebrew maintainer, and we've noticed certbot won't build any more.
We need a way to tell the build process where to find augeas. (See Homebrew/homebrew-core#16757 (comment).) Our only alternative at the moment seems to be to do some hacky string replacement, which isn't good for anyone.
My operating system is (include version):
macOS Sierra
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Homebrew
I ran this command and it produced this output:
brew install --build-from-source certbot
OSError: ctypes.util.find_library() did not manage to locate a library called 'augeas'
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It didn't compile.
