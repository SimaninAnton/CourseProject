Having issues with running Certbot on standard DigitalOcean Wordpress droplet. Followed steps but am hitting an error which is preventing me from finishing.
My operating system is (include version):Ubuntu 16.04

certbot --apache -d my domain.com -d www.mydomain.com

PluginError "There has been an error in parsing the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf.save on line 118: Syntax error.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):

certbot.plugins.selection:No candidate plugin
certbot.plugins.selection:selected authenticator None and installer None
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
