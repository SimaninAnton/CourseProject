Right now if someone wants to provide a specific key for their cert, they have to do so via the --csr option. However, generating a CSR with the proper subjectAlternativeNames is tedious and error prone. It would be nice to offer a --key parameter for this relatively common case.
Alternately, we might want to provide a gencsr subcommand to help people generate appropriate CSRs. This subcommand would also be a convenient place to stick options like --must-staple or --ecdsa.
