I am using a port multiplexer, sslh, to use 443 for multiple services. For that to work, I need any services listening on 443 to only listen on localhost. sslh listens to 443 "outside" and forwards traffic to the appropriate port.
When I set the ports.conf file to show:

Listen 127.0.0.1:443
cerbot fails with the urn:acme:error:connection even though the server can be accessed, on port 443 (using a browser and curl).
Once I change ports.conf to the default of listening on every IP at port 443, it works.
The renew process also fails with this issue.
