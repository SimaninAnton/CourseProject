@domcleal - saw this in ticket #3536:
If anybody else has Apache config file parse failures, please file a new ticket at https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/new to avoid more confusion, and feel free to mention @domcleal so I can try and help.
I have the same problem. Here is my the offending section of my conf file:
`RewriteMap proprefs "txt:/home/matt/public/propertiesbordeaux.com/property_reference_map.txt"
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/[^]+([A_Z0-9]+)/?$
RewriteCond ${proprefs:$1} !=""
RewriteRule ^/[^]+([A_Z0-9]+)/?$ /q/${proprefs:$1}/`
When trying to generate a cert, here is the error:
The error was: PluginError('There has been an error in parsing the file /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pb.com.conf on line 110: Syntax error',)
Note that I Apache doesn't have any problems with the conf and the server starts with no issues.
I see there was a similar issue reported as fixed (#429) but apparently, it's still a problem.
