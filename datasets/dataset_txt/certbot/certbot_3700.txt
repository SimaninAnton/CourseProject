Given the amount of requests for support for other HTTP daemons and setups (#8, #16, #21) and expected requests for support for yet others (lighttpd, etc.), perhaps there should be a (very basic) plugin architecture that lets third parties write a plugin for other servers.
These could then simply be pull-requested back in, and shipped with the main distribution.
