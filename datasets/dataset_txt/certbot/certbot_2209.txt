If I revoke:
$ ./letsencrypt-auto revoke --cert-path=/path/to/cert1.pem --key-path=/path/to/privkey1.pem
This is the output:
Checking for new version...
Requesting root privileges to run letsencrypt...
   sudo /Users/jvanasco/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt revoke --cert-path=/path/to/cert1.pem --key-path=/path/to/privkey1.pem
Did it work? Let's try it again.
$ ./letsencrypt-auto revoke --cert-path=/path/to/cert1.pem --key-path=/path/to/privkey1.pem
An unexpected error occurred:
The request message was malformed :: Certificate already revoked
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
The log is not "human readable" when it comes to figuring out if there was a success or not. I can parse the info, I'm pretty sure most people can't.
This command really needs to output a success message.
