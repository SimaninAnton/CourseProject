Hi,
today was my first encounter with letsencrypt-auto and i was overwhelmed by a bootstrapping script.
I was overwhelmed, because i just typed "./letsencrypt --help" - expecting letsecrypt printing a help message and exit. (Ok - maybe it can check if the system is already bootstrapped - but only check)
I've a rather "complex" setup on my server (nginx proxies to different VMs + some other rules including TLS SNI) for a automated script. So i would have tried the --manual or --webroot plugin and script my own automation around it. Therefore, is it really necessary to have all those dependencies? Would a tool for semi automatic letsencrypt have less dependencies?
But anyway a really big thanks, to you all, for creating a automated and FREE CA.
Greetings
