Using the letsencrypt-auto command in manual mode requires to create a challenge file under .well-known/acme-challange.
The file content should be the line printed out by the tool on the command line and be serves as "text/plain".
However if the file contains a newline, the validation fails.
Creating this file manually with an editor like vi automatically adds a newline to the end of the file.
IMHO this should be fixed to trim the string read from the web server before comparing.
