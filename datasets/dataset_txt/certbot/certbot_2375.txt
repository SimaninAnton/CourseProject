As far as I understand ./letsencrypt-auto renew should try to renew only certificates that are about to expire.
When during the renew succeeds for some domains, but fails for others, re-running it will also try to renew the certificates that already have been successfully renewed.
Basically when running the command X times there should never be a situation where rate limit error is thrown for a certificate that has already been renewed.
Example, my certificate at https://bugtracker.befound.nl was renewed, but when I (re)run the renew command I get this:
2016-02-23 10:55:45,925:WARNING:letsencrypt.cli:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/bugtracker.befound.nl.conf produced an unexpected error: urn:acme:error:rateLimited :: There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: befound.nl. Skipping.
(I have verified in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal that there is only 1 file containing that domain name)
