In the How It Works: Renewing a Certificate on the LE homepage, the switch --keep-until-renewal is mentioned. However, this switch isn't available in the LE client, it's called --keep-until-expiring. This unfortunately apparently confuses people.
I can't find the content of that page anywhere on GitHub; otherwise I would have made a PR..
