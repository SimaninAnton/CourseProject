hello everybody,
on a call of certbot-auto on a freshly installed linux box, certbot-auto attempt to install some packages like python and others via apt-get.
if certbot-auto was called with --quiet however, apt-get firstly does not respect the quiet parameter. furthermore a confirmation to install the packages ("y" + enter) is necessary, potentially blocking an automated system (installation) completely.
i beg of a maintainer to add "-qq" to any possible apt-get if certbot-auto was called with the "--quiet" parameter.
thank you very much for your attention.
