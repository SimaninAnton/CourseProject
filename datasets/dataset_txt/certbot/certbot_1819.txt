Hello, thanks for certbot! I'm attempting to use it behind an https proxy, and it hangs after asking me for my email address, eventually erroring out with this message:
ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /directory (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f7f4f42f510>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 110] Connection timed out',))
I'm fairly confident that this is due to it not using the https proxy set in both https_proxy and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables. Any ideas?
