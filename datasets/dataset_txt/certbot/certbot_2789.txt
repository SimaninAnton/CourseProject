I just installed letsencrypt on a test-system and I'm quite startled about all the stuff it requires. While this is very useful for those not that skilled, it's alarming for those trying to minimise the footprint of their system.
Please split this tool into two packages:
a small one for experts. Containing only the "manual" plugin part. No change to webserver-config, not fancy dialogs, not web-service.
a full-featured one, containing all the bells and whistles.
