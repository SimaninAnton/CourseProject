The acme package now relies on pytest when running tests through setuptools / python setup.py test and after the release we found out it has some issues when running tests with pytest < 3.0. The issues show up as errors talking about “import file mismatch” and can be fixed by adding a pytest.ini file with contents like:
[pytest]
norecursedirs = *.egg dist build
This pytest.ini file needs to be included in the acme package.
