Very minor issue, but when I ran letsencrypt certonly with domains like
domains = example.com, www.example.com, a.example.com, b.example.com, c.example.com
I expected that the cert files would go into /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com, but to my surprise they actually went into /etc/letsencrypt/live/a.example.com.
For a better location, I'd suggest either using the first domain name specified, or the root domain if all domains are subdomains.
