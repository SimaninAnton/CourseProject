So in certbot_apache/constants.py we have this code:
    os_info = util.get_os_info()
    try:
        constants = CLI_DEFAULTS[os_info[0].lower()]
    except KeyError:
        constants = CLI_DEFAULTS["debian"]
Basically, if you're OS isn't one we we expect, we assume it's Debian. Is this the correct behavior? With Debian, we assume there are sites-available/sites-enabled, mods-available/mods-enabled/, a2enmod/a2dismod, etc.
Perhaps if we can't recognize your OS, we should choose defaults with handle_mods and handle_sites set to False by default. I created this issue in response to #3302.
@joohoi, IIRC you wrote most of this code. What do you think?
