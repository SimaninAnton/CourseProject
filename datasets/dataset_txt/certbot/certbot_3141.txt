I had problems with the manual method at All-inkl.com
At least I made my way easy and made with:
mkdir -p .well-known/acme-challenge/
a directory in the webroot.
Startet letsencrypt with:
./letsencrypt-auto auth -d DOMAINNAME --authenticator manual
Then I wrote a php-file with name well-known/acme-challenge/$CRYPTICNAME.php and the content:
$data = '{"header": {"alg": "RS256", "jwk": {"e": "AQAB", "kty": "RSA", "n": "blablabla"}}, "payload": "blabla", "signature": "blabla"}';
header('Content-Type: application/jose+json');
echo $data;
?> 
It worked.
IMO there should be an automatism to generate the content of this php-files.
It will be easier to use letsencrypt for customers of webhosting plattforms
