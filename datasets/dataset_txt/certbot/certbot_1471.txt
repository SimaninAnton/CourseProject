As pointed out in the discussion of #3972, we have some common patterns in our tests.
Pattern 1
setUp() creates a temporary directory and tearDown() destroys it.
Pattern 2
setUp() creates a temporary directory and creates/sets config_dir, work_dir, and/or logs_dir paths to be somewhere inside it. tearDown() destroys all directories.
Let's dedupe this code. I think the best approach is to make a class in certbot.tests.util called something like TempDirTestCase for pattern 1 that is a subclass of unittest.TestCase and make another class for pattern 2 that is a subclass of TempDirTestCase.
