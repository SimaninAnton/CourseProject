I have build up my own workflow with a small python script which stops nginx, calls letsencrypt to renew, creates TLSA record which get pushed to DNS and creates symlinks for the certs and starts nginx again.
Every now and then the auto-update breaks my workflow. So please give us a switch to NOT update on every client call!
