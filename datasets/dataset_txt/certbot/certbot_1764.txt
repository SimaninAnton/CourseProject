Sorry this might just be me being stupid but when i preform ./certbot-auto renew --force-renewal it works and returns
Congratulations, all renewals succeeded. The following certs have been renewed: /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.tld-0001/fullchain.pem (success) /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.tld/fullchain.pem (success)
but when i preform ./certbot-auto renew --dry-run it doesn't work and returns errors
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/mydomain.tld-0001.conf
2016-10-02 02:35:31,688:WARNING:certbot.renewal:Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/mydomain.tld-0001.conf produced an unexpected error: Failed authorization procedure. mydomain.tld (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Failed to connect to 213.113.115.232:443 for TLS-SNI-01 challenge. Skipping.
When I use renew without any flags it says that the certs are not due for renewal yet (as it should) but I'm unsure if the command will work when i set it up as a automated task. I'm using Apache/2.4.10 on my raspberry pi running raspbian jessie. Again sorry in advance for missing something obvious.
