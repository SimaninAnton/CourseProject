How did you install Certbot:
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
What command did you run and what output did it produce?
./certbot-auto
Can you provide a Certbot error log showing the issue?
It is stored by default in /var/log/letsencrypt - feel free to redact domain names, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit
./certbot-auto
