Hi,
It's never the right time to have issues...
I got a certificate expiring tomorrow, and I can't renew it.
letsencrypt certonly --apache --renew-by-default --domains 
Requested domain  is not a FQDN
This is what I got for the domain https://canada.with.susie.and.louwii.fr/
What file should I modify in order to make that work ? I'd like to renew my cert quite quickly.
Thanks !
