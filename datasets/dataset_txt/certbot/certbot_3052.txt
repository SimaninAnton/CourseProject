I'm on a Debian system and I have the config files /etc/apache2/sites-available/ This is also where it's writing the new config file. But to enable it I need to create a symlink in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/.
It seems that somewhere during the renewal it removes the file in sites-available creating a dangling symlink which then results in an error trying to restart apache2, breaking the whole process.
I also don't think it's a good idea to remove that file in any case, it will cause the site to go down even if you remove the symlink too. Also, since I had to edit the file because of other bugs I would appreciate that you didn't revert my changes.
One thing I noticed that it says that my configuration was broken or something, not sure why it says that. It was working perfectly.
