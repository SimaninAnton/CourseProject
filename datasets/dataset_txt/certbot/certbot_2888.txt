I've recently set up letsencrypt on my server and I was not quite happy with how the default setup process works:
letsencrypt uses port 80 to do the challenge/response thing https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/236af19a50de18a7cd831157dc53a6d22f79ee10/acme/acme/challenges.py#L223
It asks to temporarily stop an already running web server for it to bind its own web server to port 80 https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/d209b5ea20c2f5f35eadc304dbe5cbb85c233f4d/letsencrypt/plugins/standalone.py#L222
This causes downtime of the main http service. Downtime = bad.
Please offer an option to bind to another port and proxy_pass it to port 80. This will not cause any downtime.
