According to the documentation, it is possible to tell certbot to reuse the same private key that already exists in the current certificate. Thus I have been running the following command to renew certificates:
certbot renew 
–rsa-key-size 4096 
–no-self-upgrade 
–dns-route53 
–noninteractive 
–reuse-key 
–post-hook ‘systemctl reload nginx.service’
Nevertheless, the cert.pem is modified after this operation – when diffing it with its version before renewal. I would expect it not to change at all since the private key is being reused.
I need to reuse the same public key in order to avoid pinning issues with IOS, is there a way to actually preserve it?
