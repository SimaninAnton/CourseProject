I'm the maintainer of this lib https://github.com/tinganho/haproxy-with-letsencrypt-auto-renewal.
I've recently updated my certificate or actually created a new certificate with an additional domain. I then received a notification that my certificate(old certificate) was being near expiration. I suddenly freaked out and needed to check my server and verify that this was not the case.
People don't keep track of what is new or old certificate or what's the difference between them. And I don't want to freak out every time you send me expiry information when I add a new domain to my certificate. Could you add method for deprecating old certificates, to deal with this issue?
