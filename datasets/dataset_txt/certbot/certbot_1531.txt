Hi,
I have a multi-server configuration with rsyncs (via lsyncd) syncing all the files across servers. A successful sync can take up to 15s, and during this moment, the webroot verification fails for a subset of subdomains.
I'd love an ability to add a custom pause as described in the title to let the file system settle.
