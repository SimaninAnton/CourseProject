Looks like this is a known TODO, but I have a pressing need for it!
This is necessary for using Let's Encrypt with "serverless" (AWS Lambda) applications on Amazon's API Gateway (for instance with Zappa or the Serverless.org/JAWS Framework), as there is no way to serve plaintext HTTP through the API Gateway.
As such, with Zappa we have a bootstrapping problem where we must first generate a self-signed cert for the initial domain deployment, then use the LE manual client in TLS-SNI-01 mode to generate our first LE certificate. Currently, this is impossible because this feature isn't implemented yet in the LE manual plugin.
I imagine the interface would be quite simple, simply add a "--challenge-mode" argument that defaults to http-01 but accepts tls-sni-01. The other change would be to the SimpleHTTPServer CMD_TEMPLATE to use ssl.wrap_socket on port 443.
I'd be happy to implement it if you'd accept that, but if somebody owns this part of the code already would like to step up and add this feature, that'd be much appreciated as well.
Thanks!
