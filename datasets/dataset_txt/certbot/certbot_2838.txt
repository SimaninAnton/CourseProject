Originally reported by @hokascha at #1294 (comment), refiling as a new issue.
The SSLCipherSuite directive here is missing an ending double quote, but Apache appears to parse it fine (it passes a config test anyway) while Augeas (under LE) fails.
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
        SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRS$
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
Full config at https://gist.github.com/hokascha/87da802584fa2b0675cc.
Waiting on a fix in Augeas, filed as hercules-team/augeas#330.
