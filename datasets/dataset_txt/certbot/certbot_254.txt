My operating system is (include version):
Raspbian GNU/Linux 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
upgraded from old version insatlled from certbot-auto.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
time ./certbot --version --no-self-upgrade
certbot 0.30.2

real 0m16.749s
user 0m15.850s
sys 0m0.780s
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
it requres approximatly 10e9 instructions to produce a string having 14 characters. I believe that is way to much of an energy/co2.
