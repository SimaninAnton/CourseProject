From the upstream page:
As of version 2.12, the reference implementation of pythondialog (which this file belongs to) requires Python 3.0 or later in the 3.x series.
This means that the pythondialog dependency cannot be fulfilled on Debian jessie and later.
There is an out of date backport, but it comes with this warning:
This version is only here to help users who are somehow forced to still use Python 2, even though Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008. It may be the last update for Python 2. In addition, the reference implementation is less likely to have bugs.
and it's not in Debian, nor is it likely to ever be in Debian.
