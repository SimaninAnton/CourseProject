My operating system is (include version): Ubuntu 16.04
Certbot version: certbot 0.14.2
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc): apt-get
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot update_symlinks
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
When symlinks have been destroyed (in my case due to backup using a solution that strips symlinks) or corrupted (pointing to files that don't exist) the symlinks are not rebuilt/fixed in anyway way.
I propose that update_symlinks should overwrite the existing symlinks in a fault-tolerant manner.
