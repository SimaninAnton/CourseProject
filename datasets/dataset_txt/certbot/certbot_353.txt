If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Fedora 28
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
dnf
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot -h certonly
....
-d DOMAIN, --domains DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
Domain names to apply. For multiple domains you can
use multiple -d flags or enter a comma separated list
of domains as a parameter. The first domain provided
will be the subject CN of the certificate, and all
domains will be Subject Alternative Names on the
certificate. The first domain will also be used in
...
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The CSR created by certbot has all the domains in the Subject alternate name, but does NOT set the CN.
It looks like commit cacee80 dropped the line that sets the CN.
