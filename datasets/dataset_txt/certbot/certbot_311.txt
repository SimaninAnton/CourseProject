My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Package manager, using instructions from https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ sudo certbot --nginx certonly
An unexpected error occurred:
pkg_resources.ContextualVersionConflict: (cryptography 1.9 (/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('cryptography>=2.2.1'), {'PyOpenSSL'})
Please see the logfile '/tmp/tmpfwhq_j1x' for more details.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It returned a version conflict where all dependencies were installed automatically and not changed by me.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
n/a
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/html;

        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
