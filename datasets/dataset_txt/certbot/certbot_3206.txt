I am attempting to generate a certificate for *.test.local.com
I am on Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10.4) and I am running the following:
./letsencrypt-auto auth
and I follow the prompts on screen and after I enter the domain *.test.local.com the following error pops up:
 An unexpected error occurred.
 Error: unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Error creating new authz :: Syntax    error
 Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
But the contents of `/var/log/letsencrypt' is empty.
I thought it might be a permission problem so I attempted to the as sudo however I got errors similar to the following:
The directory '/Users/intilery/Library/Caches/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
So I added -H to the command and brew refused to run the application:
Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
WARNING: Mac support is very experimental at present...
Error: Cowardly refusing to `sudo brew install`
You can use brew with sudo, but only if the brew executable is owned by root.
However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at
your own risk.
Is this a known issue, or is there a solution?
