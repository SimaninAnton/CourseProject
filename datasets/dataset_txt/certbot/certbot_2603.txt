letsencrypt-apache configures apache to listen to port 443, by default on all interfaces. If there is another process bound to port 443, then apache will fail on restart and letsencrypt cannot validate the certificate. The error message is currently:
MisconfigurationError: Error while running apache2ctl -k graceful.
httpd not running, trying to start
Action '-k graceful' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.   

(98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 127.0.0.1:443
no listening sockets available, shutting down
AH00015: Unable to open logs
should letsencrypt check if the Listen statements added by the configurator can actually be bound to?
(It should be fairly simple, we can just try to bind to that interface ourselves)
