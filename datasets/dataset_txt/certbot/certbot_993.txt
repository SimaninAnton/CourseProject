# certbot
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system. However, it can still get a certificate for you. Please run "certbot certonly" to do so. You'll need to manually configure your web server to use the resulting certificate.
IMO it'd be simpler if certbot automatically falls back to certonly. The user can always cancel if certonly isn't what they wanted.
