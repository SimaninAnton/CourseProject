I think we should consider this for our next release as it will dramatically simplify our code. If we remove already_listening as #3623 suggests, our optional dependencies have little to no benefit.
The biggest change this would cause is the simple_verify method in ACME for the DNS challenge either needs to:
Raise NotImplementedError
Always return True.
If any third party plugins/clients that use ACME use this method, we should probably just return True. Otherwise, we should probably do the former and consider removing the simple_verify method from all challenge objects.
