Apparently nginx has implemented TLS 1.3 and you have to turn it on in the configuration. (I don't know what happens if you try to enable it with an older version of nginx without TLS 1.3 supportâ€”apparently it may have been syntactically invalid before the nginx 1.13 release?)
It would be useful to have an enhancement that enables this in a Certbot-edited nginx configuration if it isn't already enabled, perhaps with some kind of check for the software environment to ensure that it would actually work and not make the configuration invalid!
I also don't know how this affects ciphersuites, since the supported ciphersuites in TLS 1.3 are different from earlier versions.
