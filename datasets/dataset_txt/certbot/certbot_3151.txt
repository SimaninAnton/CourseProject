I'm using Apache on Debian. I already had TLS configured, and thus had SSLCertificateFile, SSLCertificateKeyFile and SSLCertificateChainFile statements in my Apache site config.
letsencrypt-auto correctly replaced the values of the first two, but failed to change SSLCertificateChainFile, resulting in breakage.
Invocation:
./letsencrypt-auto install --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem --key-path /etc/letsencrypt/keys/0000_key-letsencrypt.pem --agree-dev-preview 
Site config before invocation:
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com
        DocumentRoot ...

        ErrorLog ...
        CustomLog ...
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com
        DocumentRoot ...

        ErrorLog ...
        CustomLog ...

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile ...
        SSLCertificateKeyFile ...
        SSLCertificateChainFile ...
</VirtualHost>
Apart from that, it worked nicely, and so we now finally have what CACert has kept promising for "next year" for the past 10 years or so. So thanks for all the work, letsencrypt is amazing! ‚ù§
