Turn the letsencrypt-auto symlink at the root of the project into a copy of letsencrypt-auto as of the latest release. Add a line to the release script to copy the latest build to the root.
Our instructions used to tell people to git pull and then run le-auto from the root. This will keep them from running a bleeding-edge master version and allow us to tiptoe less around changes to le-auto (double reviews, etc.).
