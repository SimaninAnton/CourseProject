We should be Python 3 compatible now! Before the next release though, we should:
Spend some time playing with it to see if we can find a corner case where it breaks. If so, it should be added to our integration tests.
Make tools/venv3.sh install Certbot and it's official plugins (fixed in #4532)
Modify the relevant setup.py files listing support for Python 3.
Update system requirements in docs/install.rst to mention support for Python 3 versions.
