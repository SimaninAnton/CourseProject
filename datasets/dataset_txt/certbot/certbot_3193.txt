Currently, somewhere in the depths of sphinxbuild, it is trying to invoke the letsencrypt and letsencrypt-renewer executables in order to get the help information. However, at the time that the manpages are built for Debian, the executables have not yet been installed to the system paths.
Is it possible to invoke these executables in place in the source tree, instead of expecting them to be in the system path at the time of generation? (That seems to be a bit chicken-and-the-egg-y to me anyway.)
