I know you can add alternative names to a certificate when creating it by using the "-d" option multiple times with the letsencrypt-auto script. I was woundering if it's possible to add more alternative names into an existing certificate? I have looked around and it seems nobody has an answer to that. would be greatly appreciated if you explained how to do this so I don't have to create more separate certificates as there is a limit on how many times I can do this
