Right now the developer instructions say to run:
./certbot-auto --debug --os-packages-only
Right now on Ubuntu, that will install python and python-dev (the Python 2 packages). However, latest Ubuntu (19.10) ships with python3 and python3-dev, but no Python 2. Since we fully support Python 3, we shouldn't encourage people to install older Pythons. That's likely to mask issues with Python 3 support that we otherwise might find during development.
Since the list of packages in --os-packages-only has been static for a while, I recommend just hoisting the list of packages into the developer instructions, and replacing python and python-dev with python3 and python3-dev. This avoids risks in changing certbot-auto.
