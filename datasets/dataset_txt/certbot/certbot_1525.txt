Right now there isn't a list of dependencies that are needed to run
make -C docs clean html man
to build the documentation. Adding these dependencies to contributing.rst would save developers time when trying to locally verify the formatting of their changes to the documentation.
I will work on this myself; opening this issue for tracking.
