With limited or no SSH access users https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/elementary-procedure/2534 who want to use Letsencrypt SSL certificates, they would need access to a server with SSH. What if they can generate the SSL certificate one 1 SSH enabled server and use Letsencrypt Certificate Manager to backup those SSL certs/keys and then use the Manager to redeploy them on another server ?
or would Letsencrypt Certificate Manager also require SSH access to use it ?
