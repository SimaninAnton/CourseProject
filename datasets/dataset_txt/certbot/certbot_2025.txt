Redirection to https isn't working for
cokers.com.au
The following is in virtual host settings:
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =cokers.com.au [OR] RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.cokers.com.au RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,QSA,R=permanent]
the following has been ran:
$ /home/user/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --apache --redirect --reinstall
But still does not redirect to HTTPS... subdomain 100.cokers.com.au was installed first, this does redirect properly and contains the same information.
(i have disable default virtual host, this was causing default site to be shown even when cokers.com.au was typed).
