The simple case is easy. They just need to update Certbot, test renewal with --dry-run, and make sure that they've configured automatic renewal for that version of Certbot.
It gets more complex if the user has set --preferred-challenges in the past. It gets more complex if there are different challenge preferences that must be remembered for different lineages.
