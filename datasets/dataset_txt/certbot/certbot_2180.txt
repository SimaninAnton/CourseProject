In considering automating some post certificate creation/renewal tasks - I ran across the --renew-hook option in the "renew" command. It seems that such options would be very helpful also for the certonly command - especially since "certonly" is recommended for "more fine-grained control" in the renewal of specific certificate lineages. It would allow users to script certificate installation within applications after certs are created increasing options for automation.
Does this make sense, or is there already some other way to have LE report the LINEAGE and DOMAINS in order to script installation of certificates once they are created/renewed with certonly?
