Hi
I need your help to resolve my problem.
I install the "mod_wsgi" for apache but when I run my apache I get this problem :
AH00526: Syntax error on line 56 of /appli/apache/2.4.29/apacheshinken/conf/conf.d/vhost-graphite.conf:
Invalid command 'Order', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
[ERR] apache apacheshinken start err 0
I don't idea, so I see the file of "vhost-graphite.conf"
I see this at line 56
<Directory /opt/graphite/conf/>
Order deny,allow
Allow from all

thank for your help.
