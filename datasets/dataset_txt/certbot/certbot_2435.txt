Hi,
I'm on Gentoo and using nginx. I'm using letsencrypt in "manual" mode and I'm using the certificates of the live folder directly from nginx.
I'm trying to renew one of my certificate before I automate the process, but I'm having difficulties.
In my script, I'm using this command:
/usr/bin/letsencrypt certonly --renew-by-default --standalone -d DOMAIN
Unfortunately, it does not renew the certificate but create a new certificate DOMAIN-0001.
How can I make letsencrypt replace current certificate in the live folder ? Should I use the install command somehow ?
Thanks
