My operating system is (include version):
python2.7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt
I ran this command and it produced this output:
hangs during certificate generation, then produces a dnspython timeout
There are three issues to be solved to make certbot also compatible with dyn.com
update.dyndns.com only support UDP.
update.dyndns.com does not support domain name queries, only does updates.
subsequent .add with records of the same name are updated instead of added (i.e., resulting in one entry). For wildcard and domain certificate, two TXT entries with the exact same record name are required. This is only possible if the records are added in the same request. Hence a little dictionary of lists to keep a history.
I believe issues 1 and 2 are perhaps something to implement as configurable items for the general rfc2136. Issue 3 is really an issue with Dyn.com, however this was already addressed 8 years ago and is likely to be fixed.
I have uploaded my "fixed" dns_rfc2136.py here.. Unfortunately, I don't have time to make this into a pull request, nor do I think it's ready for that in this state.
