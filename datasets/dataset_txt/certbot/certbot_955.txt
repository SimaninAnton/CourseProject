My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/opt/certbot/certbot-auto --no-self-upgrade --noninteractive certonly ...
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot shows: Bootstrapping dependencies for Debian-based OSes... and takes some minutes....
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Bootstrapping dependencies for Debian-based OSes...
Hi,
iam using certbot in a docker-container but cant cache certbot dependencies in docker-image. Is there any way to trigger certbot bootstrap(installation of deps) only without getting a cert. Something like: /opt/certbot/certbot-auto --justbootstrapandquit would be very helpful.
Thx,
K
