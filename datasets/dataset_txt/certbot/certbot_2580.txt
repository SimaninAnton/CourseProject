In https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/client-takes-almost-one-hour-to-create-certificate/8579/3 and #1648 (comment) we've seen users for whom the client is very slow. The root cause winds up being that outbound IPv6 connectivity from their web host is broken in some way.
We should add timeouts to the HTTPS connections, and produce an error message if it takes more than, say, a minute to connect. We could include a few ideas on how to fix, including checking IPv6 connectivity with wget -6 https://www.google.com as described at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/client-takes-almost-one-hour-to-create-certificate/8579/3.
