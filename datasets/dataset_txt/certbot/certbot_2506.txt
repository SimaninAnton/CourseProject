Commit f5862a7 introduced a change in letsencrypt-apache/letsencrypt_apache/configurator.py in line 536 and following to remove a vhost from the list if a new vhost with the same path is found. This breaks the detection of multiple apache vhosts in a file. With this change my cronjob can not automatically renew my certificates.
In my opinion it would be great if the script does not remove vhosts within the same file when the number of the vhost is different. The variable vhost.vhpath contains the position in braces at the end if multiple vhosts are in a file.
