My operating system is (include version):
Debian 9 Stretch
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
root@isaacchen-RFCHost:/etc/nginx/sites-available# apt install certbot

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
certbot : Depends: python3-certbot (= 0.21.1-1+ubuntu17.10.1+certbot+0.2) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
debian using libssl1.0.0 version 1.0.1 but python3-certbot needs libssl1.0.0 version 1.0.2
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
