As per ACME spec:
"If the server already has a registration object with the provided account key, then it MUST return a 409 (Conflict) response and provide the URI of that registration in a Location header field. This allows a client that has an account key but not the corresponding registration URI to recover the registration URI."
This is not implemented by the acme module
