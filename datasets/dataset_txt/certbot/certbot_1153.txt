I am unable to run renew on my domains and sub domains. My uninformed guess is that certbot-auto has updated and the renewal configuration is no longer valid.
My domain is:
https://ganchrow.com/
I ran this command:
certbot-auto renew --dry-run
It produced this output:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/ganchrow.com.conf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cert is due for renewal, auto-renewing...
Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/ganchrow.com.conf produced an unexpected error: An object does not implement interface <InterfaceClass certbot.interfaces.IInstaller>

        . Skipping.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS 3.13.0-108-generic
My web server is (include version):
nginx/1.10.0 (Ubuntu)
Cerbot version:
certbot 0.14.1
I can login to a root shell on my machine (yes or no, or I don't know):
yep.
Here is the file contents ganchrow.com.conf:
# renew_before_expiry = 30 days
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/ganchrow.com/cert.pem
privkey = /etc/letsencrypt/live/ganchrow.com/privkey.pem
chain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/ganchrow.com/chain.pem
fullchain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/ganchrow.com/fullchain.pem
version = 0.12.0
archive_dir = /etc/letsencrypt/archive/ganchrow.com

# Options used in the renewal process

authenticator = webroot
installer = webroot

Here is a stack trace that is from the letsencrypt.log:

Thanks for your help.
ps- I also posted this at letsencrypt.org community support, but I haven't had any response yet and so I am posting it here, too.
