When letsencrypt-renewer is run, it makes temporary changes to the web server configs, reformatting everything in the process (at least for nginx). Those changes are not fully cleaned up after the renewer is done. Running 'letsencrypt config_changes' after as a workaround implicitly performs that cleanup (rev.recovery_routine()) and puts back the original config files. The renewer should be doing this itself.
Note: my use case is letting letsencrypt manage config changes for domain validation, but making the persistent changes to deploy the new certs myself; thus, I don't expect letsencrypt to ever make lasting changes to my nginx config files.
