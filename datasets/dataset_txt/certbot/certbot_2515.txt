I have my own renewal script written in python, which stops nginx, calls letsencrypt, does some other stuff and starts nginx after all finished. My script worked fine till I renewed a cert today. The renewal worked, but the message "Congrats ...." was send to stderr and triggered an error routine.
I can work around it commenting this error routine, but the congrats message should go to stdout anyway.
