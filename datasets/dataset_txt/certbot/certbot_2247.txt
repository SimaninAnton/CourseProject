I tried to enable https for all my sites' subdomains simultaneously via
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d deentaylor.com -d luke.deentaylor.com -d api.deentaylor.com -d www.deentaylor.com
In my setup, www.deentaylor.com is an alias for deentaylor.com, which redirects to luke.deentaylor.com, so that any of those 3 pages will resolve to luke.deentaylor.com.
After running these commands, I can visit https://api.deentaylor.com, https://deentaylor.com (which redirects) and https://www.deentaylor.com (which also redirects). However, I cannot visit https://luke.deentaylor.com without getting a 404. (I can still visit the insecure http site, although I did specify for letsencrypt to force https)
The problem seems to be that separate .conf files were generated for all domains except luke.deentaylor.com. With ls /etc/apache2/sites-available/, I see a luke.deentaylor.com.conf but not a luke.deentaylor.com-le-ssl.conf, while I do see an api.deentaylor.com-le-ssl.conf as well as a similar file for the other domains besides luke.deentaylor.com.
Re-running the command, this time targeting the domain specifically with ./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d luke.deentaylor.com, doesn't resolve the issue.
Note that https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=luke.deentaylor.com doesn't see an issue.
