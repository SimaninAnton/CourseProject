As reported by @steckerhalter in #1266, if the user creates a vhost listening on 443 that doesn't support TLS, the Apache plugin will raise PluginError: Unable to find cert and/or key directives when trying to install a cert on that vhost.
I repoed this problem using a clean installation of Apache on Debian Jessie and adding the following vhost:
<VirtualHost *:443>
    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
    # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
    # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
    # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
    # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
    # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
    # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
    ServerName example.com

    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
    # error, crit, alert, emerg.
    # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
    # modules, e.g.
    #LogLevel info ssl:warn

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
    # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
    # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
    # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
    # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
    #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
Ideally, we should handle this case and add the SSL directives for the user. This makes the assumption that the user wanted that vhost to use HTTPS though which may not be a safe assumption to make.
At the very least, we should improve the error message as getting told there are no cert/key directives when asking certbot to create cert/key directives is a confusing error message.
