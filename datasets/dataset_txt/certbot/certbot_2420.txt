I'm trying to setup an endpoint
example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge
but I can't find any node.js code that will return the appropriate response
I'm trying to setup an API Gateway that will automatically renew my certificate. I managed to generate a certificate using letsencrypt by spinning up an instance, like suggested by this user here:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/aws-api-gateway-lets-encrypt/7060/7
but it's not clear what this endpoint should return ... would be lovely if somebody had a node.js endpoint that I could just plug into lambda and point the AWS api gateway to that....
