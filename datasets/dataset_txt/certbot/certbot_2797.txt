I start letsencrypt-auto (without args) and get and error:
"No names were found in your configuration files.
You should specify ServerNames in your config...."
however I do have a ServerName entry in a file called apache's conf.d/fqdn, which apache seems to pick up fine.
(This doesn't block continuing, but picking up these values as well would improve the automation of letsencrypt)
