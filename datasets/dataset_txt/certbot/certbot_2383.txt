I am new to letsencrypt but i was reading through the documentation and found that the wrapper script letsencrypt-auto is actually determining the OS distribution and installing dependencies based on that. I would recommend to use something like Omnibus to package dependencies (https://github.com/chef/omnibus) or Hashdist (https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist) along with letsencrypt.
There are some disadvantages to packaging dependencies (because you need to keep track of updates to all bundled dependencies) but maybe worth to consider.
