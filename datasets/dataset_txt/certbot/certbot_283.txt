In our test-everything branch (and soon to be master after #6661 lands), we run py34 and py37 unit tests multiple times. This is because we're using the value of TOXENV to sometimes run unit tests and sometimes provide us with a Certbot installation under a certain version of Python. When we just need the Certbot installation and don't need to run unit tests, we should use py34_install and py37_install environments like we do for py27_install.
