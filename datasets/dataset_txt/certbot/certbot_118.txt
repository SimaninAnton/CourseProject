This can be found at https://ssl-config.mozilla.org. In general, doing this is a little tricky because we don't want to break people with old versions of Apache/OpenSSL. Looking at the code that is used to generate these config snippets may be useful for this which is found at https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator.
For now, I don't think we should be enabling HTTP2, HSTS, or OCSP stapling as part of this. We may want to reconsider doing this in the future, especially for HTTP2, but so far we've thought about these things as an optional security enhancement for Certbot and I think deciding to enable these features on all configs should be a separate issue.
