I have an ExpressJS app that is running on an IP address only at port 3030.
How can I create the SSL cert and key for this type of address?
I tried with:
$ certbot certonly --standalone --email test1@yahoo.co.uk -d 127.0.1.1:3030
I get this error:
Requested domain 127.0.1.1:3030 is not a FQDN
Any ideas?
