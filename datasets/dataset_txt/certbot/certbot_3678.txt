Hello,
Since letsencrypt is targeting less experienced system administrators (dare we call them users?), it'd be good to have nice error messages instead of these:
...
  File "/root/.venvs/letsencrypt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/python2_pythondialog-3.0.1-py2.7.egg/dialog.py", line 485, in _path_to_executable
    "can't find the executable for the dialog-like "
dialog.ExecutableNotFound
and
...
  File "/root/.venvs/letsencrypt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/python_augeas-0.5.0-py2.7.egg/augeas.py", line 75, in _dlopen
    raise ImportError("Unable to import lib%s!" % args[0])
ImportError: Unable to import libaugeas!
