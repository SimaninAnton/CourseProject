##The version of Certbot:
certbot 0.19.0
## My operating system is:
Centos 7 - Kernel 3.10.0-229.11.1.el7.x86_64
Certbot installs a line to include the configuration of the file
options-ssl-apache.conf
According to https://www.ssllabs.com the cipher DES-CBC3-SHA is weak and should be disable but by default this file include it. Manual modification is not recommended and the include line is automatically added every time you new the certificates.
So, I recommend to not include in future versions this cipher.
Thanks!
