If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu trusty trust
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot --nginx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://numi.ru.darovec.com.ua
and https://my.numi.ru.darovec.com.ua
You should test your configuration at:

Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
