I am using an extensive blacklist of IP addresses to secure my server. This has not been a problem in the past, because the Certbot verification bot was using IP address 66.133.109.36.
Today, I am unable to have my domain verified by the bot. Can't even see any attempt in the HTTP server logs. I suspect that my firewall is dropping the packets because the IP is no longer 66.133.109.36.
Can you publish the list of possible source IPs?
