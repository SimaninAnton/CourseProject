Issue #3552 describes an issue where certbot would fetch a cert and then fail to save it. Because I'm running it twice a day (as recommended), I've hit the renewal frequency rate limit, so now I can't easily renew it, even though I've moved the missing directory.
This seems like it could be a wide class of problems: some error causes a new cert to be fetched, but a later error prevents it from being saved successfully. Even if certbot was modified to detect this issue before getting a new cert (the topic of #3552), It might be more broadly nice if the recommended usage and rate-limiting config were such that rate-limiting wouldn't be triggered by a constantly-failing script. This could mean changing the recommended usage (source) to alternating days or the rate-limiting to allow up to 15-20 certs a week. A third approach would be to maintain a count of renewal attempts, and automatically skip some renewal attempts if recent attempts have been failing.
(The first two solutions would presumably be implemented in another repository, but between the third solution and the fact that #3552 is in this repo, I'm filing it here. Hopefully that's not too confusing.)
