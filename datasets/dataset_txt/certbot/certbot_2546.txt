I appreciate this may have been done on purpose, but it's not really helpful when trying to 'dockerise' letsencrypt. This is my usecase:
I have a LE container which exposes the etc/letsencrypt/live// directory to an nginx proxy (a reverse proxy for a few domains). However because the cert files in the live directory are softlinked the nginx container does not have access to the softlink targets (in the etc/letsencrypt/archive directory).
I don't want to expose the whole etc/letsencrypt/ directory to the nginx proxy because that's a bit of a security risk (and the reason why I chose to deploy Docker! plus I don't want to expose additional cert files). Anyone got any suggestions as to deal with this? Short of copying the certs somewhere that's accessible?
TIA
