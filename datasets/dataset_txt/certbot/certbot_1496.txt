When running certbot-auto, and it tries to see if it needs to update itself, if a plugin is causing the letsencrypt --version to NOT return the version number, certbot-auto will not show any error, and will simply re-install the virtualenv completely.
I would expect certbot-auto to instead return the error returned by letsencrypt --version, and simply exit.
This will allow me to fix what is wrong with the installed plugin, or uninstall it.
