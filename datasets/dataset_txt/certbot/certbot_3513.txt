Hi,
Can I secure a domain like forum.example.com even though I don't own example.com? Assuming the people at example.com has configured their DNS servers to map forum.example.com to my server, where I host their forum.
I noticed that sub domains are supported (#355) but I'm not sure if I need to own the main domain.
Best regards, KajMagnus
