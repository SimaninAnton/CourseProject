Hello,
Please correct me if I'm wrong, I ran ./letsencrypt-auto certonly, enter my FQDNs, then I'm got following message:
│ The program httpd (process ID 98230) is already listening on TCP     │  
│ port 80. This will prevent us from binding to that port. Please stop │  
│ the httpd program temporarily and then try again.                    │  
Isn't certonly suppose to do only certificate for me and I'd need to apply it myself?
