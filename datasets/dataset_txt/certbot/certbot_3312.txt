Steps to reproduce:
Run
letsencrypt --server SERVER_PATH --no-verify-ssl --authenticator standalone --text --agree-eula --agree-tos -d 1.le-test.hoffman-andrews.com auth
Ensure the authentication fails somehow. In my case it specifically failed with a 400 in POST /acme/challenge/..... One way to accomplish a similar thing would be to run a local Boulder, do a successful LE run (to set up the registration), then bring down Boulder and try another LE run.
Then run another authorization request.
Expected result:
Success, or another failure.
Actual result:
The program letsencrypt (process ID 12717) is already listening on TCP port 443. This will prevent us from binding to that port. Please stop the letsencrypt program temporarily and then try again.
