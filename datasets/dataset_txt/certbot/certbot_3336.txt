Hi @kuba,
It would be very useful for us to be able to track what versions of the clients people are making requests with. I propose that we override the requests UA to something of the format "Let's Encrypt Agent v$(version) plugin $(apache,nginx,standalone)".
If we do that, I'll make sure that we override that code somehow to pass the Debian version in so that we can track that separately. We can just have the version number in a single file and incr it there, I think.
FYI @jsha
