If you request a plugin and pass flags to it on the command line but the plugin isn't installed, Certbot's error message isn't very useful. For example:
$ certbot --authenticator foo --foo-arg bar
usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate. 
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: --foo-arg bar
Ideally, we should say that a plugin named "foo" isn't installed.
