I am trying to register the preview.builders domain, but I am getting "type":"urn:acme:error:malformed","detail":"Error creating new authz :: Name does not end in a public suffix","status":400 on the Sending POST request to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/new-authz call.
The domain has been in the public domains list for a while:
https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blame/master/public_suffix_list.dat#L7392
Am I missing something?
