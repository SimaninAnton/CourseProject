Hi,
According to this issue, there are 51 participants that talked about the support - or not - of wildcard certificates with your Let's Encrypt offering.
I believe it's a huge number and we need:
the research papers that show the evidence in the fact that wildcard certificates weaken TLS security as you said ;
the explanation of why it's not a conflict of interest negociated with one of your first sponsors - and your strongest partner also - named IdenTrust: was the deal to weaken the security of your offering and don't offer wildcard certificates to avoid the cannibalization of the CA market?
Thanks,
HLFH
