I was running something like:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone -d one.mydomain.org -d two.mydomain.org -d three.mydomain.org
and got the error:
2016-01-27 14:36:55,569:INFO:letsencrypt.reporter:Reporting to user: The following errors were reported by the server:

Domain: one.mydomain.org
Type:   urn:acme:error:tls
Detail: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge
Creating certificates individually for the subdomains works - but since I've got a few of them, I'm running into the rate limit with that.
