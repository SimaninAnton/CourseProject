My operating system is (include version):
# uname -a
Darwin server.my.tld 17.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.5.0: Fri Apr 13 19:32:32 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4570.51.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
# machine
i486
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
# brew install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
# certbot
Illegal instruction: 4
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It doesn't start at all...
But only after a reboot of the machine.
It worked fine last week
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
--- no logs ---
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
--- no config ---
Here is something interesting I found
while debugging I think i have found out that it might be a python issue!?
# certbot
Illegal instruction: 4
# /usr/local/Cellar/certbot/0.24.0/libexec/bin/python3.6
Illegal instruction: 4
But still, maybe someone can point me into the right direction?
