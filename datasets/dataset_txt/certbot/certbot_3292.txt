In Boulder, we switched from go get ...goose to fetching a pre-built binary, which saved 30 seconds on our Travis builds. The client code can realize the gains by switching test/boulder-start.sh to use boulder/test/travis_before_install.sh for its dependency installs. There's a slight penalty because it installs tools like golint that the client doesn't need, but I think it's a net win.
Also, FWIW, you may want to have boulder-start.sh use boulder/test/run-docker.sh when running locally (non-Travis), since that avoids installing as many packages on the developer's machine. Unfortunately the Travis build already runs in a Docker container, and we can't run a nested one, so this isn't an option for the Travis tests.
