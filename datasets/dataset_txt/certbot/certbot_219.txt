See https://codecov.io/gh/certbot/certbot/pull/6784.
Why is there a drop in coverage on the manual, nginx, and standalone plugins? Those plugins aren't at all affected by the PR.
Is there a way to see what codecov is comparing the coverage against? I spent a few minutes poking around and couldn't quickly figure it out.
