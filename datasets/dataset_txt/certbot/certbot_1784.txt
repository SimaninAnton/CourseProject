Over the weekend I had a few of my sites go down due to an expired Let's Encrypt certificate. I determined that the renewal process was failing due to this documented error. I had the latest letsencrypt package installed from the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository, but the latest version available through their repo is 0.4.1. Once I manually downloaded and ran the Certbot client, I was able to renew my certificates without error.
Until a 1.0 release is made available, and the API is stable, or until Ubuntu's repositories have more frequent updates, Certbot should not be recommending that users install the letsencrypt package from Ubuntu, but instead suggest using the Certbot client directly.
