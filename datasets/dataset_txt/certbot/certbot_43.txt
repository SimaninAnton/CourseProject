As described in the comments following https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-failing-to-find-python-version-on-centos-6-10/105634/5, it's possible that scl_source does not exist on RHEL 6 based systems. To reproduce this in the CentOS 6 Docker image, run:
yum install epel-release -y
yum install scl-utils-20120229 -y
You can enable the SCL repository and install rh-python36 after this and a newer version of scl-utils containing scl_source will not be installed.
I think we should fix this before rereleasing the code migrating people to Python 3.6 on SCL.
To do this, I think we can either try to make sure a new enough version of scl-utils is installed (although I'm not sure the best way to do that) or stop using scl_source and either manually modify our PATH or manually source /opt/rh/rh-python36/enable.
