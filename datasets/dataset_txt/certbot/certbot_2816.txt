latest version of the official client installed; just ran git pull.
worked fine until several days ago with a pull i had made then.
webroot auth being used.
centos 7 / nginx (but i'm installing the cert(s) manually)
same error appears on renewal attempts as well as new domain cert requests.
tried using a cli.ini file as well as full command line only.
no change in results.
what am i missing?
