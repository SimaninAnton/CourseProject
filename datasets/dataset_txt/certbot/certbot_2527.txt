Hello,
I tried renewing our certificates today, and I got an error from letsencrypt-auto. The error message was:
VersionConflict: (ConfigArgParse 0.9.3 (/home/bogdanb/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('ConfigArgParse>=0.10.0'))
Please see the two attached files for the logs:
execution.log.txt
letencrypt.log.txt
This is after I had deleted the ~/.local folder where letsencrypt stores its downloads. (I had the same exception before.) This is on an Ubuntu 15.04 machine:
