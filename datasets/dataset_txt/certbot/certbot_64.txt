My operating system is (include version):
NixOS 19.09
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Package Manager, NixOS/nixpkgs#61203 (certbot v0.35.0)
We run builds in an isolated environment, without network access inside the tests at all.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
pytest certbot-ci/certbot_integration_tests

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot already boots up pebble as an acme endpoint. We should not need to do any network access.
