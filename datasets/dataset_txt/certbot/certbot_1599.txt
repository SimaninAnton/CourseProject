I'm trying to use certbot on raspbian.
I managed to get it installed, I've also installed libaugeas0 and augeas-lenses
apache2 is installed either, with ssl enabled.
But when I run the command sudo certbot --apache, I get the following error:
The requested apache plugin does not appear to be installed
How can I fix that?
