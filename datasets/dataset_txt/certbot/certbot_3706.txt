I don't use Apache, rather I use Caucho's Resin. It will be challenging for you to support lots of servers out of the box. Perhaps you should concentrate on providing a "generic" variant, that generates the certs and keys, exports them in the appropriate format, and drops them in a local directory, so that we can then manually install them?
Also, do you handle manual naming (in case the reverse DNS isn't what we want to secure)?
