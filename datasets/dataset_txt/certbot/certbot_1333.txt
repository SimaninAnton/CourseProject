My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 6.6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Installed with certbot-auto
Service httpd cannot be restarted after certbot-auto, there is this following errors
[warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts
which worked normally before certbot install.
Any help will be more appreciate.
Thank you for your time
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
