Hi there,
I followed the simple installation steps here https://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuother-apache and successfully (it seems) downloaded & installed certbot-auto on into my virtual Ubuntu 12 hosting.
However, after installing, whenever I run ANY command (even --help) for certbot-auto, I get the message:
$ ./certbot-auto --help
./certbot-auto: 23: ./certbot-auto: basename: not found
...which refers to the following line #23
BASENAME=$(basename $0)
Didn't find any information on this error neither here on Github, in Let's Encrypt Community Forums nor with a Google Search.
I'm on a Parallels Plesk based virtual dedicated hosting environment, where I can only SSH into my Accounts root-directory. Ubuntu OS Version is 12.04.4 LTS. The file & directory structure looks like the following:
$ ls

Does anybody have a clue what might be going on and how I can fix this? Or can I even assume that a manual run of cerbot on my Plesk based Ubuntu Hosting will not work due to limited access?
Thanks for any help, much appreciated!
