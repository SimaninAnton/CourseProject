As of v0.36.0, certbot_apache depends on certbot >= 0.36.0 because of the import of filesystem from certbot.compat. However, this dependency is only exposed at run-time and in setup.py -- there is no test coverage that runs this import.
This exposes a risk that CI/CD systems will not catch a broken import. A test should be added to require the filesystem import during test time.
