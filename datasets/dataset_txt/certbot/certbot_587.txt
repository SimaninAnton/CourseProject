My operating system is (include version):
SunOS 5.11
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ ./certbot-auto --help
./certbot-auto: OLD_VENV_PATH=~/.local/share/letsencrypt: is not an identifier
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The certbot-auto script errored on line 29.
Possible explanation
Looks like the script runs in sh while it would actually require bash. See this Stackoverflow post for more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50029500/launching-certbot-auto-fails-on-old-venv-path
