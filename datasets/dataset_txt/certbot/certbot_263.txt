When Certbot configures Apache for HTTP validation, only one VirtualHost is configured for any single requested domain name. If user configuration has multiple VirtualHosts with the same name configured either in ServerName or ServerAlias directive (including wildcard names), only one and possibly the wrong one is configured.
As a solution, Apache plugin should configure all the matching VirtualHosts to be able to answer the HTTP domain validation challenge.
