There seem to be some open questions to us as a webhosting provider regarding implementation of Let's Encrypt as a service for our customers:
How is it possible to transfer a Let's Encrypt certificate from one account to another?
As a hosting provider we'd like to be able to install new LE certs or transfer existing LE certs installed on another hosting provider via some sort of administrative API, how would we be able to handle that, given the restriction that every account only has one keypair? Of course, our users would have to grant us the permissions to do so, but this kind of third party involvement does not seem to be fleshed out anywhere in the current ACME specs nor the boulder implementation, is that correct? How would we go about that?
How would we automatically import a LE cert from another hosting provider for a given user?
