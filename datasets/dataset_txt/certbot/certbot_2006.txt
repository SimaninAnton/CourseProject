For some reason, nosetests stopped showing the coverage missing lines.
After doing some research, I figured that we can fix this by using a coverage config file and setting the show_missing parameter to true as shown here. https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.1/config.html#report
This doesn't work because in order to do this, we need to use the --cover-config-file argument that is supposedly supported by nosetests. However, nosetests crashes with nosetests version 1.3.7.
This issue is reported here. nose-devs/nose#1001
