In #1665, I moved mock from the packages' install_requires to their tests_require, which allowed me to switch from an explicit invocation of nose in tox.ini to python setup.py test. However, to minimize disruption late in the release cycle and keep my PR on target, I did only what was necessary. This ticket is about finishing the job.
Let'sâ€¦
Move nose from the testing extra to tests_require (if we in fact require it). [Ed: we don't.]
Move auxiliary tools like coverage and pep8 from the testing extra to tox, which is what calls them.
Remove the testing extra altogether if it ends up being empty.
