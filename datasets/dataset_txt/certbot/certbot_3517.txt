Right now it is hard to configure on the command line the variables that storage.py will use to decide things like where to save certs. (They can be configured via a configuration file, but not on the command line.) We should integrate the configuration of the renewal store with the regular command-line configuration.
This is tricky because the renewal-related code all uses configobj, while the client CLI uses configargparse. They don't really have the same model of how to define or represent options.
