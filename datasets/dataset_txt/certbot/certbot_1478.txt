Hi all, Certbot on Ubuntu 14.04 uses a old version of Pip (8.0.3) even if the newest version of Pip (9.0.1) is available. I can not run the $certbot-auto renew command with succes, because it gives the InsecurePlatformWarning warning. Can I fix this? Underneath I pasted all the output:
Command "/home/wolthuis/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2.7 -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-Txn1F9/cryptography/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('

You are using pip version 8.0.3, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
=====================================================

Certbot has problem setting up the virtual environment.

Based on your pip output, the problem can likely be fixed by 
increasing the available memory.
