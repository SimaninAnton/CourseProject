My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager (yum)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --nginx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Upgrade config files in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled folder as well
So my question is basically how can I tell certbot where to look for an nginx config to upgrade? Do I have to always copy all my server blocks into nginx.conf, upgrade with certbot, then copy the modifications back to my sites-enabled config file?
