A number of issues in our DNS plugins can be fixed by using a new version of Lexicon such as
#6972
#7411
#7425
Unfortunately, we cannot easily update the version of Lexicon pinned in this repo causing a new version of Lexicon to be used in our Docker images because Lexicon has dropped Python 3.4 support and we have not. Once we've done this (which is tracked by #7393), we should update the version of Lexicon pinned in tools/dev_constraints.txt to the latest version.
