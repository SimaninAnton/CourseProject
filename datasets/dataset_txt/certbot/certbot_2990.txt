I've initially posted it at the wrong place (see here), from where I was sent to another wrong place – so I hope try number 3 hits the right place now:
The client accepts a config file using the -c <filename> parameter. I'm using this to setup things. With new domains whitelisted, I had to create a new certificate – so I've setup my config file, putting the host names in the domain = name, altname1, altname2 line. On call, the client crashed:
Error: [('asn1 encoding routines', 'ASN1_mbstring_ncopy', 'string too long')]
Bad thing, as wildcards are not permitted and the cert (in this case) must hold all the names. Figured I can work around this via the -d command-line parameter (-d name -d altname1 -d altname2), and the cert was created fine. Checked the .conf file in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal – and found the domain = line being exactly as quoted above.
Verdict: this limitation just applies to the -c <config> file, but not to the renewal config file. Work-around exists as described – but it still would be nice to see this fixed.
