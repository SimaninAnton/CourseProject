I am attempting to get certbot working on the following amazon ec2 LAMP stack instance: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B007IN7GJA
The instance comes pre-installed with apache, however when I run the the steps outlined in https://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntutrusty-apache from the home directory I receive the following error after running the ./certbot-auto command:

No installers seem to be present and working on your system; fix that or try running certbot with the "certonly" command
Afterwards, when I run the certbot-auto --apache command I recieve the following error:
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
My understanding is these errors are suppose to trigger when Apache isn't installed properly on the system, but since Apache is on the system and I'm running Ubuntu 14.04, this should not be the case.
