Erica pointed that since we're running tests on master nightly running tests on each commit to the branch may not be necessary. Sure, there may be edge cases where the combination of multiple pull requests cause a problem in master and break something, but this is extremely rare (in almost 4 years of working on Certbot full time I'm not sure if it's ever happened?), would be caught by our nightly tests in at most 24 hours, and dramatically saves us on Travis resources.
I personally think we should do this, but I'm not sure the best way to accomplish it. I think if we remove master from the list of branches we test, we'll stop testing PRs against master and the Travis cron job on master might stop working as well. The best idea I have is to add conditionals so that none of our tests run on push events to master which is probably fine, but if other people have ideas, please share!
