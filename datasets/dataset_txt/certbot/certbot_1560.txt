On version 0.9.3
Trying to run:
./certbot-auto renew --dry-run --preferred-challenges=tls-sni-01
Results in the error:
Cert is due for renewal, auto-renewing...
Starting new HTTPS connection (1): acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org
Renewing an existing certificate
Performing the following challenges:
Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.<site>.com.conf produced an unexpected error: None of the preferred challenges are supported by the selected plugin. Skipping.
Can't seem to find anything on google and according to the docs the "tls-sni-01" is supported, is this a bug or am I using it wrong?
