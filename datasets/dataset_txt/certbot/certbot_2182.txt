Apache plugin should notify the user when parsing a file with multiple VirtualHosts, currently we aren't telling the user what we do expect of the configuration schema. The current functionality - to just leave user with a message "No virtualhost found" is not sufficient to identify the reason why this happened.
This issue was originally reported in #2776
