Now that 0.21 is out, Apache and Nginx users should be fixed, but only if they're using certbot-auto, at least until we get into jessie-backports and other distro packaging. I think until that happens, we should change the docs on https://certbot.eff.org/ so that any choice of "Nginx" or "Apache" gets you the certbot-auto instructions, even if Certbot is packaged for your system (because the packaged Certbot is definitely broken right now).
