We use the docker image with the tag v0.29.1 from https://hub.docker.com/r/certbot/certbot/. It looks like that image disappeared.
I like to pin to a specific version to have consistent behaviour. Is there a policy in place for deprecating/removing certain versions? What is the best way for me to ensure that the version I'm using still exists?
