My operating system is (include version):
$ cat /etc/debian_version
9.8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Using apt-get.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx -t stretch-backports
...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 certbot : Depends: python3-certbot (= 0.28.0-1~bpo9+1) but it is not going to be installed
 python-certbot-nginx : Depends: python3-certbot-nginx but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It should now be installed.
I tried everything from #5573:
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep stretch
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free

$ sudo apt --fix-broken install

The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  libdate-manip-perl libsys-cpu-perl libsys-meminfo-perl
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
