Earlier it was suggested just making these URLs optional parameters to the affected methods in ClientBase and having the derived classes provide them to the base class methods. Another possible approach is to have the Directory class try either naming convention (ACMEv1 version or camel case) and only fail if neither directory field exists. If both exist, we can either favor ACMEv1 or ACMEv2 or raise an error.
