Currently certbot_nginx.parser._add_directive() expects a spaced list as an argument, and converts it into an UnspacedList. But this leads to all sorts of horrible bugs within the nginx plugin where newlines or spaces were missing in some call to it, causing potentially subtle problems with the config (eg a directive becomes part of a comment!).
