My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
0.17.0 - 2017-08-02
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt:

so i runed python ./setup.py install
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
an then i get this error
