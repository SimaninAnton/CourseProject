I was writing up simple instructions for setting up a Windows VM for Certbot development and following the steps as I did so when I hit an issue. After installing Python 3.7 from https://python.org and cloning this repository, I tried running python tools\venv3.py. The result was tools\venv3.py exiting with an error saying that it couldn't find python3 in my PATH. It appears the Python 3.7.1 installer put a python executable in my PATH, but not a python3 one.
I think we can avoid errors like this and simplify this process by also checking the version of Python that was used to run the tools\venv*.py script. If it's the right version of Python, I think we should use it even if it's not in your PATH. I don't have a strong preference whether we prefer the python interpreter used to run the script or the one found in your PATH if both are available.
What do you think @adferrand? If you agree, I'd appreciate a simple PR with this change, however, I can also write it up myself if you think it's a good idea.
