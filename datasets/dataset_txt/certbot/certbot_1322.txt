My operating system is (include version):
archlinux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
os package manager, version 0.12.0-1
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew (updated successfully)
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
certbot replaced current nginx config for server with old version of this config. The difference between configs are in some rewrites, letsencrypt part is not modified.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
