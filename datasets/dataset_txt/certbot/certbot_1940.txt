I had a case reported here:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/renew-not-working-for-expired-certificate/17883 (thanks pfg)
letsencrypt renew managed to get & write new certificates to /etc/letsencrypt/archive/ but didn't update the symlinks in /etc/letsencrypt/live/ (probably I didn't run the command as root -- my error).
Subsequent runs of letsencrypt renew told me my certificate was updated but the live symlink didn't change from '1' to '2' files so I thought the renewal wasn't working properly.
I think letsencrypt renew should try to defend against errors like this by checking the live symlinks point to the latest version of the archive files, even when it doesn't request a renewal.
