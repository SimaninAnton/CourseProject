Since Boulder uses hostnames to delineate between breaking protocol versions, there may be instances where a Boulder instance stops working at a particular URI. While not a preferred approach, if a serious security issue were to arise at acme-isrg-v09.host.tld prompting the server to stop accepting version 09, it'd be nice to provide enough data to the client that the client could provide a useful error notification.
I would also prefer this be a static notice, such as a static json response.
Presumably the client cannot on its own provide remediation in these cases, but it may be good to provide plaintext description (localized?), and perhaps links to more details (CVE, blog post?).
The ultimate result would be an updated client, using a new URI, such as acme-isrg-v0A.host.tld/acme/new-reg. And I've no idea if we want to use hex or decimal for versioning, but hey, thought I'd be inclusive.
