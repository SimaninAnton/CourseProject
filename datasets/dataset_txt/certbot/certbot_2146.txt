In #2885 I did not change the name of the venv created by *-auto. The reason for this is I believe we expressed some concern about people reaching into the venv to run letsencrypt directly, e.g. ~/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt.
Do we want to rename the venv? If not, we need to revert the change made on this line.
