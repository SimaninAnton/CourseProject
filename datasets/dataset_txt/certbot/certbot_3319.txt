Seen with debhelper 9.20150101.
The debian/*.debhelper.log created by "dh" should be removed but isn't. This results in a subsequent
debian/rules build
not doing much (as "dh" thinks that dh_auto_build already ran).
dh_clean would normally do that, but is overridden. Maybe just call it from the override_dh_clean hook?
I'm also not quite sure, what "cd $(CURDIR)" is supposed to do...
