If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Debian 9.4
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
sudo apt-get install certbot -t stretch-backports
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Could not choose appropriate plugin: The requested dns-cloudflare plugin does not appear to be installed
The requested dns-cloudflare plugin does not appear to be installed
I cannot find anywhere on the certbot wiki at all regarding the installation of plugins. There is no mention of it at all, so I found myself over here: https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/3757/how-to-install-certbot-plugins
I ran this command to install the certbot-dns-cloudflare plugin pip install certbot-dns-cloudflare. IT does not list it under my certbot plugins list - so I ran the command again and got this output.
