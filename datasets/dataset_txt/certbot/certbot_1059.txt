Some errors during renewal print the path to a certificate, e.g.:
Attempting to renew cert from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/jacob.hoffman-andrews.com-0001.conf produced an unexpected error: Account at /etc/letsencrypt/accounts/acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory/06c4ea2fe30100e185fea43f26817312 does not exist. Skipping.
It would be nice to also print the cert name, since that is the identifier used to delete certs through Certbot.
