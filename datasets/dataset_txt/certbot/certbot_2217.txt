According to the documentation (https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#id9) it is not possible to validate a domain through https requests.
I have multiple domains which I redirect with return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; thus they are only accessible through https.
I have to run a script to comment out the redirection and reload nginx before running the automated letsencrypt script.
Is there another way to get around this situation? Thank you
