Nginx plugin requires /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem and /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key.
Nginx plugin fails whenever nginx fails to restart.
Nginx fails to restart when config file contains broken paths.
Snakeoil cert and key are created in post install hook of the ssl-cert Debian package. This package is not installed by ./bootstrap/debian.sh.
Admin might simply delete snakeoil cert and key anyway.
We want to support systems other than Debian-derviatives.
Due to 5. and 6. it's not sufficient to update bootstrap scripts to apt-get install ssl-cert. I would suggest creating our own snakeoil certs in the process or deleting those ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key stanzas altogether. @diracdeltas?
Tested on fresh digitalocean 14.04 x64 droplet, reported by @jcjones.
