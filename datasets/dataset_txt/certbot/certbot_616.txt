This usually requires just adding type annotations for empty global data structures. Back in January, this took a few hours of work (including reporting bugs with reproducers). It’s probably even less work now. By default, mypy will only check the interior of functions that are annotated, so with an unannotated codebase, this is just making sure mypy can analyze your entire codebase.
