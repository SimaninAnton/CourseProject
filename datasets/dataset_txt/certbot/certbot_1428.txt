Currently Travis tests will fail if {certbot,letsencrypt}-auto in the root of our repo isn't the same as the version from the most recent release tag. The result of this is Travis tests will fail from the time the release is pushed live until the PR incorporating certbot-auto changes is merged. Instead, we should allow certbot-auto to either be the version from the most recent release tag or the version currently in master.
