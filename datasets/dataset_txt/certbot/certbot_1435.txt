@lindhe in #3480 is reporting difficulties connecting to Let's Encrypt. Despite similar errors, the cause is likely very different than the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable, so we should track it in a separate issue.
@lindhe, if you're still having problems, can you run the following on your server?
${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/letsencrypt/bin/python -c 'import requests; print requests.get("https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory").text'
