In order to install letsencrypt on CentOS 6.x with python 2.7 i use IUS Community YUM repo and that installs virtualenv-2.7 which is at a path that letsencrypt-auto doesn't detect for https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/client-version-0-3-0/9654/2/
Creating virtual environment...
./letsencrypt-auto: line 167: virtualenv: command not found
path
rpm -ql python27-virtualenv | grep bin
/usr/bin/virtualenv-2.7
so you might need to edit letsencrypt-auto to check for paths like you did for python binary
