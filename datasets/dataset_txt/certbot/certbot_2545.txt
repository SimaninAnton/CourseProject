CentOS 6 ships with Python 2.6 by default, which isn't 100% stably supported by letsencrypt, and which the Python community at large is trying to drop support for. But there's good news! CentOS has support for Software Collections which make it possible to install Python 2.7 in parallel: https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/python27/
Would it make sense for letsencrypt-auto to just install a Python 2.7, in addition to all the other packages it provides, in order to a) ensure users always get a fully functional environment, b) help encourage folks to move to Python 2.7
