There are many places where the Let's Encrypt client will generate cryptographic keys or parameters, or set or use cryptographic parameter or algorithm defaults (including defining key sizes and ciphersuite defaults for servers in which we enable TLS!).
We need a thorough review of whether all of our choices are good, not least because they may become the TLS configuration defaults for millions of Internet servers.
I started a page to collect references to what other people have had to say about ciphersuites at
https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/wiki/Ciphersuite-guidance
That mostly doesn't include information about choices for other kinds of parameter and keylength options, but in a few places it does (and maybe we can put more of that kind of material in there).
