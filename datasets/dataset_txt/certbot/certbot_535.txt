I am using CentOS 7.4 and Certbot version 0.22.2
I have around 30 websites configured with Apache on single server and for them when I run command
sudo certbot --apache
it asks me for 'Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?' and then I type in 1,2,......,30 all the number of websites.
All goes fine and it installs SSLs on all websites, but for some reason the common name for each website remains one and that is of the very first website. Is it something what we called the base domain or what? and how can we avoid it and make sure that each website name displaying on browser should also be separate?
