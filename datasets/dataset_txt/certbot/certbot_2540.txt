Basically, I'm trying to integrate letsencrypt with streisand, an anti-censorship project https://github.com/jlund/streisand
The code sets up a lot of things for the user, but users still have to download a cert and install it in their browser to use it, so I thought maybe letsencrypt could help. Problem is streisand is designed to work without a domain.
I'm not an expert in this area, so maybe this is not a good proposal, but I know it's possible to associate a cert with an IP address. It seems like it might not be a good idea, since you might be able to mitm traffic sent to an ip after you no longer control it...altho if that's true, it would also be true of domains...
Any help understanding this?
