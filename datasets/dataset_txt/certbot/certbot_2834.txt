If I have some kind of error in any of the config files for Apache, letsencrypt-auto fails.
If I run "./letsencrypt-auto", I get the response "No installers seem to be present and working on your system; fix that or try running letsencrypt with the "certonly" command", which really don't say anything. Of course I can check the logs to find out what went wrong, but that requires knowledge that the logs exist.
If I run "./letsencrypt-auto --apache", I get an error at least, but it might be a bit hard to understand: "The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/apache2/sites-available/error', u'Syntax error'),)".
Sure, it tells me that there is a problem in a specific file, but it doesn't tell me where or what.
For my example I am using Ubuntu 14.04.3, and created a file called "/etc/apache2/sites-available/error", containing the text "<>".
