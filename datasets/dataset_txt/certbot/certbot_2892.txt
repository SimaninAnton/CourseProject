The makefile to create the man pages requires the application to already be installed.
Unfortunately this creates a fairly circular dependency that is an issue in packaging for Fedora/EPEL
Due to the way rpmbuild works there is no time letsencrypt, jws or letsencrypt-renew will be on the path to be called to capture the --help output unless it is already actually installed in the mock environment.
Is there a specific reason sphinxcontrib.programoutput was selected to created the man page or is it feasible to generate a man page without the application from being installed in the first place?
Calling make in the %install section with PATH manipulation to build the man pages is not very clean and it would be far nicer to generate from markdown or similar (or just a plain straight man page) in the %build phase
