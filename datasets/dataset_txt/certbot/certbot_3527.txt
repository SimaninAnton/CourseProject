Currently the renewer script doesn't attempt to instantiate the installer and hence can't invokve the installer's .restart() method to restart the web server. Restarting the web server would be expected behavior as part of a deployment because it's necessary in order to make the server actually start using the new cert.
(The file links are successfully updated as part of the deployment step, but most server software wouldn't know to re-read them.)
The process of instantiating the installer ought to be exactly parallel to the existing process of instantiating the authenticator.
