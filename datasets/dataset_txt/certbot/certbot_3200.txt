I know Python 2.6 isn't supported so need to use Python 2.7 which I installed beside CenTOS 6.7's default Python 2.6.6 at python2.7 and that previously worked with web root authentication at https://community.centminmod.com/posts/19325/
however, it no longer works with CentOS 6.7 + python 2.7
i did the following for install by sed replacing virtualenv with python2.7
cd /root/tools
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
cd letsencrypt
sed -i "s|--python python2|--python python2.7|" letsencrypt-auto
./letsencrypt-auto --verbose

./letsencrypt-auto --verbose
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies...

Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-mdwUEl/ConfigArgParse
maybe it should be python2.7 instead ?
