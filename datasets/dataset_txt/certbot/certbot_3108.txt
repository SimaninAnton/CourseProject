hey :)
after first run of:
./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server \ https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
i get this error output:
An unexpected error occurred.
Error: unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Error creating new authz :: Name is not whitelisted
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
e-mails sent to mydom.
Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
