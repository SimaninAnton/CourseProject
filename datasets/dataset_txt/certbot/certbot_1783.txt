We see a fairly large number of sites misconfigured to serve only the end-entity (leaf) certificate, not the entire chain. I believe part of this is that we create a file cert.pem in addition to fullchain.pem. For someone looking to manually install a certificate, cert.pem looks like the natural choice. We can help people configure their sites correctly by renaming cert.pem to something else, like leaf.pem. This should be accompanied by a README in the certificates directory explaining what each file is.
We don't want to disrupt existing lineages where people are depending on certain naming conventions, but can can have Certbot take this new behavior for new lineages.
I realize this is a fairly disruptive change, but since part of our goal is to remove the human error and pain points in deploying certificates, it seems worthwhile.
