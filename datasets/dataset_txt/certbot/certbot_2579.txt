Few months ago it was working just fine and today when I wanted to run letsencrypt again to renew certs I ended up with error
./letsencrypt-auto --help
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.....Command "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2 -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-PGmqEf/cffi/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-gvaH1u-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/include/site/python2.7/cffi" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-PGmqEf/cffi
I tried to delete and redownload letsencrypt but it didn't help.
