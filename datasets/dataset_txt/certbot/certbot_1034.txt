Debian 9
ii certbot 0.10.2-1 all automatically configure HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
ii python-certbot 0.10.2-1 all main library for certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
# certbot certonly
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
2: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): 
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It's unclear what both of the choices do and require. Standalone sounds good, but I think it requires port 80 and/or 443 to be free, which they probably aren't as those are common ports for existing web servers. ;)
Webroot sounds OK, but does this root need to be accessible via port 80 or via port 443?
What if port 80 redirects all requests to https?
What if port 80 isn't used at all?
I think:
This scenario should be supported better.
Things should be explained better.
