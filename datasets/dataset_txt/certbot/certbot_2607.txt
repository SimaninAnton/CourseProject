According to https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt, System Requirements:
"The Let's Encrypt Client presently only runs on Unix-ish OSes that include Python 2.6 or 2.7..."
However, when I run ./letsencrypt-auto --help, I get:
"WARNING: Python 2.6 support is very experimental at present...
if you would like to work on improving it, please ensure you have backups
and then run this script again with the --debug flag!"
My question is, when will Python 2.6 be fully supported?
thanks
