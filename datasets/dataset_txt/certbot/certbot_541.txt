I'm renewing the certificate and have setup a redirection from http to https site (same domain). I'm using lighttpd and run certbot-auto certonly. When it requires creating a new acme-challenge file, I create the file and it is accessible from web browser and by wget, but authorization procedure fails since it does not follow redirect.
