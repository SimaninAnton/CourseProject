The nginx guide for Debian stretch (also affects apache guide) states:
Due to a security issue, Let's Encrypt has stopped offering the mechanism that the Nginx plugin previously used to prove you control a domain. You can read more about this here.
We released a new version of Certbot to work around this, but it hasn't been packaged by your OS yet.
It looks like the http-01 update was 0.21. The current version installable via stretch-backports is 0.25.0.
As far as I can tell, the nginx plugin works on the current version.
