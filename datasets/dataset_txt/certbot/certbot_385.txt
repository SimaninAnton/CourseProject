My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Ubuntu PPA
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I ran sudo certbot renew --dry-run --dns-route53 and it produced:
Attempting to renew cert (mydomain.com) from /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/mydomain.com.conf produced an unexpected err
or: 'AWSHTTPSConnection' object has no attribute 'ssl_context'. Skipping.                                                            
All renewal attempts failed. The following certs could not be renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem (failure)
I believe this is happening due to this botocore issue.
