We should remove the "-preview" suffix. This will be the production client provided by Let's Encrypt, and as we approach release the suffix no longer serves a purpose.
Note to any casual readers of this bug - Let's Encrypt will provide a client, but subscribers are not obligated to use the client provided by Let's Encrypt in order to use Let's Encrypt services. Alternative clients are welcome.
