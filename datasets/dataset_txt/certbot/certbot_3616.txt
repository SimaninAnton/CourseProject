Currently the standalone configurator always tries to listen on 0.0.0.0, which is an error if any other process has the same TCP port bound on any interface (including the loopback interface!).
It would be useful to be able to enumerate interfaces in order to be able to bind only non-loopback interfaces in this particular case. It would also be useful to let the user specify an address to listen on using a command-line option.
There are also future consequences for IPv6 support in how this is handled. (I think the CA currently only performs DVSNI tests over IPv4.)
