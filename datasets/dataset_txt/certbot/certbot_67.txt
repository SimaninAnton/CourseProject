As pointed out by Adrien at #7377 (comment), we should set up notifications in Azure Pipelines so we know when a build fails.
Unlike Travis CI we may be able to set up notifications directly to Mattermost. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/notifications/howto-integrate-third-party-services?view=azure-devops and know that Mattermost supports Slack's API.
