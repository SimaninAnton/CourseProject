My operating system is (include version):
Debian 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/certbot-auto --help
[sudo] password for alex: 
Upgrading certbot-auto 0.24.0 to 0.26.1...
Replacing certbot-auto...

  certbot-auto [SUBCOMMAND]
[Help output continues.]
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Trying to get the help output to get the syntax correct on the actual command you want to run is not the time you want to sit and wait several minutes for the script to update and rebuild its virtual environment. The --help flag should bypass the update check. Let it update when I run a real command that I'm expecting to take a little bit of time.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
N/A; logs aren't written when you request help.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
