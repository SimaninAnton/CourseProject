My operating system is (include version):
Debian 8 (I expect Ubuntu 14.04 and later will also be affected)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Probably OS package manager (I don't know for sure because I'm filing this bug report based on someone else's post in the community forum)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot --apache
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: PluginError(('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', '/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf.save', 'Syntax error'),)
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot shouldn't have tried to parse that file at all, because Apache only includes files matching *.conf by default on Debian 8.
