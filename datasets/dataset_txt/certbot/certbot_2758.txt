I was looking through the plugin examples and I think it might not be too difficult to create an Installer that pushes certs to AWS. There is an API call to upload certs to IAM and another one to update the ELB config to use the new cert. Both of these API calls are available in the AWS Python SDK and should be pretty straightforward to execute.
Does this look feasible to you? I'm not a Python guy (Ruby is more my thing) but is this something that I might be able to handle, with a little help from you?
