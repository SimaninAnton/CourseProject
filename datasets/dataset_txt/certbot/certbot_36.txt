The location of the Certbot package inside this repo is moving in #7544. We need to fix up the https://github.com/certbot-docker/certbot-docker before our next release so things will build properly. Doing this is probably just fixing up https://github.com/certbot-docker/certbot-docker/blob/master/core/Dockerfile#L51, but we should test that.
Despite this being in another repository, I'm creating the issue here so we don't lose track of it.
