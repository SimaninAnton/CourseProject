if something was missing or wrong in your OS'es bootstrap script, but it returned success, it won't be run again, even after a letsencrypt-auto update
if something is statefully broken in the user's virtual environment, pip will keep trying to set it up each time letsencrypt-auto is run but will never remove the broken state (unsure if that type of breakage is really possible)
