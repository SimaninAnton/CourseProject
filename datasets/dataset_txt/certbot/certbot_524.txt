My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.3
I installed Certbot with
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Command:
certbot certonly --standalone -d google.fuck.off.of.kreuzberg.or.we.make.more.of.your.tracking.exposed
Error:
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator standalone, Installer None
Obtaining a new certificate
An unexpected error occurred:
The request message was malformed :: Error creating new authz :: DNS name has too many labels
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I was not expecting the number of dots will prevent ACME to work. And I'm not aware of any hard limit about the number of dots.
