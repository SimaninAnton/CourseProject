I get the following error trying to get a certificate for a subdomain of a dynamic dns provider:
There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: sytes.net
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
The domain name is like abc.sytes.net, the provider is http://www.noip.com/. And I would expect a lot of requests for such providers.
After digging trough some of the existing issues, I found the public suffix list as a possible solution.
Unfortunately it is missing some of the entries of dynamic dns providers that I used.
Would it make sense to provide an additional list only targeted on such sub domains, to allow an easier usage of letsencrypt?
Then we could just not apply the limit to them? At least the sub domain is owned by myself and the certificate is only usable for it, not for the whole domain sytes.net.
This issue is related to #1721, #2091 and #1834.
