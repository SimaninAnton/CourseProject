Once mypy --check-untyped-defs passes on your codebase, you should lock down your progress by running the mypy checker in your CI environment.
Because mypy type annotations are optional, once you’ve done the setup above, you can start annotating your codebase at whatever pace you like. Over time, you’ll get the benefits of static types in the parts of the codebase that you’ve annotated, without needing to do anything special to the rest of the codebase (the wonders of gradual typing!). In the next section, I’ll discuss strategy for how to move the codebase towards being fully annotated.
