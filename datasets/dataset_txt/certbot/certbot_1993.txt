Just installed certbot from the debian Jessie 8.5 backports repository and ran:
sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example_com/subdomains/www -d example.com -d www.example.com
Which resulted in:
Traceback (most recent call last):

I successfully created a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate just yesterday following the same process... what happened between now and then?
