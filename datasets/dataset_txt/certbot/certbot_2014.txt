So yeah.
Pretty sure this ties into #2026
Mind you this happened when i went to wget Multiverse for my minecraft server (meaning i'm not hosting the server i'm trying to get the files from.)
From what i've read this issue is caused by people using cert.pem instead of fullchain.pem as the publicly available ssl certificate.
And i do not get this issue on my domain and i'm using fullchain.pem which means that people are incorrectly configuring their websites.
If you guys can notify people somehow that they are incorrectly configuring their websites, that would be great.
