A typical complex case would be something like this:
http://redant.com.au/ruby-on-rails-devops/manage-ssl-redirection-in-nginx-using-maps-and-save-the-universe/
In that case we should probably be able to spot a directive like this:
return 301 http://... and refuse to try to enable a redirect in such a configuration (or warn/ask the user before trying)
