Right now there are some limits https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/public-beta-rate-limits/4772/3 which will probably change in future but they will still be there.
If limits are just temporary it's not worth of developing I guess, but if they'll stay it would be really nice to have an option to check how many certs I have left before reaching limit. Also I don't know how excatly it works but it would be nice if revoke would give me back number previously taken by revoked cert or something in that spirit.
