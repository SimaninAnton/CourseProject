When I've tried ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --apache --keep -d aigis.pw, I got an notice: We were unable to find a vhost with a ServerName or Address of aigis.pw.
There are some vhost directives in one of my Apache config files (For example, /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl-vhosts.conf) and it seems that config file is not parsed by this client as expected.
Using Client version 0.4.1 and CentOS 7.2.
