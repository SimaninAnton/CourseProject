One of our plugin interfaces takes a RenewableCert, however, we recently made the file containing that class private. This is awkward as there there is no guidance on how to use this parameter.
I personally don't want to make all of storage.py or even RenewableCert public because there's a lot of code there that I don't think will be used in plugins and making it public makes it harder for us to refactor it.
Instead, I was thinking we could make a simple zope interface in interfaces.py describing the attributes/methods one could expect this parameter would have. I would base this off of how the parameter is used in the Apache plugin. We'd then register RenewableCert as implementing this interface and always refer to the parameter in the plugin docs through this zope interface. We do something similar to this with certbot.interfaces.IConfig.
