Currently the way Certbot plugins work is we use setuptools entry_points. This means the plugin must be installed at a path in sys.path.
For this reason, most of our 3rd party plugins tell people to run (sudo) pip install outside of a virtual environment to get their plugin. This isn't great as it can cause conflicts with packages installed from the users OS. Telling 3rd party plugins they need to get packaged by the distro also isn't a great option.
How can we reduce headaches here? Could Certbot have a canonical place for a virtual environment that Certbot also searches if its permissions are sane?
For context, the reason this is a bigger issue now is you need a DNS plugin for each provider so lots of new plugins are getting written and we don't want to take on the maintenance burden of all of them.
