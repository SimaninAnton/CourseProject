Previously I just run letsencrypt-auto and will be able to create the cert effortlessly. However today I have encounter the follow issue:
Command "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/python2.7 -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;file='/tmp/pip-build-mTEeBV/cryptography/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(file).read().replace('

You are using pip version 8.0.3, however version 8.1.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
anyone can show me some lights on how to upgrade the pip inside the virtualenv? I'm really stuck on this at the moment...
