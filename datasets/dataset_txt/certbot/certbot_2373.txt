I have a AWS hosted site. Letsencrypt certificate worked well on apache on EC2. But my images are in an S3 bucket.
It would be nice to have some instructions to create a certificate for S3 static hosted site in a bucket. Attempt to generate it gets me -
Failed authorization procedure. cdn.example.com (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: cdn.example.com
   Type:   connection
   Detail: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
   your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
   firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
   client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
   that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.
