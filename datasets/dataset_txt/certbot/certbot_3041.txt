Hello,
This is something that I can't find answer to elsewhere so please bear with me.
I use Nginx as my webserver. When I run letsencrypt-auto it complains that port 80 is already taken, obviously. So have to take down Nginx, run letsencrypt-auto and then bring Nginx back up.
Why does letsencrypt-auto require port 80? Why can't it run on any other port? Requirement to take down webserver isn't clear. Granted, my server is small and doesn't have much load so I can take it down for a minute or two but this is completely unacceptable for any production system with a constant load.
