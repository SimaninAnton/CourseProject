After releasing TCP/80 from iptables, I run ($FQDN as www.example.net):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program apache2 (process ID 450559) is already listening on TCP port 80.
This will prevent us from binding to that port. Please stop the apache2 program
temporarily and then try again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least one of the required ports is already taken.
Host has only 1 public IP, and redirects ports to OpenVZ containers. Some containers have Apache running and listening to port 80 and/or 443 (and more), but they are behind host traffic control.
Certbot detects port 80 being listened by some process, but it's not a host process and this can't interfere to host listens to TCP/80 before containers.
This error can perhaps occur with LXC too.
