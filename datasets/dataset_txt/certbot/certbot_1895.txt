I've ran into it a couple times where I'm installing a certificate on a tiny server. In my case it was Ubuntu 14.04, which still does not have the letsencrypt package (not sure if that is coming).
It would be nice if certbot-auto printed a warning message before trying to install the Python packages (in this case it is cryptography that is failing to build).
The message could be something like:
Warning your system only contains 0.5 GB of memory which is less the recommended 2.0 GB, you may no be able to build the proper dependencies needed.
Just an idea..
