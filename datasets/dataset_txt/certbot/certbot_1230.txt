This problem will go away (for now) by solving #2208, but the way we've currently been handling conditional dependencies is by dynamically setting install_requires in setup.py. This causes our wheels to be built incorrectly, however, which while it doesn't negatively affect OS or certbot-auto packaging, it might be nice to get this right.
If we do this we should get a new enough version of setuptools available in pipstrap and verify with our Debian, EPEL, and Ubuntu maintainers that this won't cause issues for them.
