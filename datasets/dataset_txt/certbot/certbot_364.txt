OVH IP load balancers hijacking /.well-known/acme-challenge/ not reaching backend servers
My operating system is (include version):
Linux, Ubuntu, 16.04 and 18.04 but will happen on any OS and version
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
any certbot instalation using HTTP-01 Challenge
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
because OVH is hijacking /.well-known/acme-challenge/ url on every http request, the challenge is never received by the server/backend.
It would be wonderful if there could be a way to ask certbot to use a different HTTP-01 Challenge /.well-known/acme-challenge/ path
