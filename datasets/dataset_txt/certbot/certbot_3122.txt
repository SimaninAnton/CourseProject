I tried to obtain and install a certificate for Apache today and while I was able to obtain one, I wasn't able to install it. Apart from the fact that the command in the beta invite e-mail was using auth which is afaik not installing the certificate and you can't simply say “okay now install it”.
Anyway I got the following error:
Cannot find a cert or key directive in
/files/etc/apache2/sites-available/ssl.conf/virtualhost.
VirtualHost was not modified
And I'm wondering what exactly that means. Now looking at the source code it seems that ssl.conf already needs to contain SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile which seem odd because if they are already there… I wouldn't need to install it.
Now for full disclosure, I already had tried to use SSL so the file already had SSLCertificateFile defined (but not the SSLCertificateKeyFile). So maybe that's the issue?
