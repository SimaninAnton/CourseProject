When having multiple accounts, and using certbot renew, it doesn't honor account from the renewal configs. It complains that it doesn't know what account to use. But when giving the accountid manually it also renews certs which are not linked to that account.
Edit: adjusted text according to the actual behaviour instead of what I remembered.
