I would like to change the common name of my certificates..
I have a domain test.example.com with a few subdomains e.g. subd1.test.example.com, subd2.test.example.com.
When I make certificates for all domains, it takes subd1.test.example.com as the common name for every subdomain I have. This can be seen by the file:
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/subd1.test.example.com.conf
How can I change the common name for all subdomains to just test.example.com ?
Thanks in advance!
