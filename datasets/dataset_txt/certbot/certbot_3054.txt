While related to #858, I feel like this is a slightly different issue. We have had reports of people running into problems with the User-Agent when using the manual plugin. manual uses acme to validate that the challenge has been set up correctly before responding to the server. This is done using the requests library whose default UA as of writing this e-mail is python-requests/2.8.1. Some webservers are rejecting requests with this UA, causing self validation to fail, and letsencrypt to exit.
