So I already have everything setup and want to add just want to add a new domain to the certificate (I have a single cert with all domains). From doc: certonly Obtain cert, but do not install it (aka "auth").
Steps:
Setup and install basic cert with: ./certbot-auto
Expand cert: ./certbot-auto certonly --expand --apache -d www.main.pl -d main.pl -d www.different.pl
Expected:
Generate new certificate with a new set of domains.
Update private key and the key chain.
Update /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf if required.
Actual result - I need to skip (Cancel) setting up domains one-by-one (there is one dialog like the one on the screen per additional domain).
