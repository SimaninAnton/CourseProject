My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 7 updated current, with EPEL 7 enabled
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
package manager:
certbot-0.23.0-1.el7.src.rpm
I ran this command and it produced this output:
[root@router ~]# /usr/bin/certbot certonly --manual -d router.example
http-01 challenge for router.example.com
Create a file containing just this data:
hJe2tuvhNYW6961Rurfq8wmCynH3SJmta1wq9fxPJNE.VTBSmjWND-K9yS2ltVBlXVvpaNQi6gtDaJgu3GcA2uA
And make it available on your web server at this URL:
http://router.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/hJe2tuvhNYW6961Rurfq8wmCynH3SJmta1wq9fxPJNE
**** this line A ***
Failed authorization procedure. router.owlriver.net (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Fetching http://router.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/hJe2tuvhNYW6961Rurfq8wmCynH3SJmta1wq9fxPJNE: Error getting validation data
**** this line C ***
IMPORTANT NOTES:
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain: router.example.com
Type: connection
Detail: Fetching
http://router.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/hJe2tuvhNYW6961Rurfq8wmCynH3SJmta1wq9fxPJNE:
**** this line B ***
Error getting validation data
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The file to be produced does NOT have a trailing 'colon'
see: line A
The error messages DO have trailing 'colon' characters
see: line B, line C
Expected result:
The filename to edit, and the error messages as to what was sought to retrieved, should be identical, and not carry the extra 'colon'
(assuming it is such)
