My operating system is (include version):
Official docker container
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Docker container
I ran this command and it produced this output:
it gives a timeout and says that it could not verify the address, but I get it with standalone and do not find the error message anymore
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I have a server with A records there it works also with nginx but on my server at home, have c records it do not work with nginx but with standalone
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
root /var/www/html/certbot/;
}
