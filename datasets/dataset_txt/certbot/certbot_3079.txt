For some reason the Litespeed Webserver for my shared hosting appears to add new-lines to text/plain files meaning that the acme challenge fails due to there being a "\n" at the end, it'd be great if LE accepted the \n or knew to remove the \n as I can't find a way to stop it having a \n in the HTTP response (I tried nano -L and echo).
It was returned as a text/plain file (ForceType text/plain in .htaccess) which I checked with HttpFox.
