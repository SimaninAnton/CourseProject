There needs to be a file created that has only the Root CA in it - no intermediates or server cert so that it can be pointed to with curl and other tools that won't have been updated with the Root CA at launch time.
It's also both useful and conventional for various applications, debugging, etc.
# with curl
curl https://example.com --cacert=/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/root.pem

# with openssl
openssl s_client -showcerts \
  -connect example.com:443 \
  -servername example.com \
  -CAfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/root.pem
It's important that it doesn't contain the intermediates so that we know the intermediates are being served properly by the webserver that we're testing and not included in the client's chain.
