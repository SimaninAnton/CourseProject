From discussion at #6155.
As a more minor point, we should probably check that symlinked accounts are deleted in the way we expect.
Deleting the accounts deletes the particular account under the directory/ folder, which remains symlinked. If you then create an ACMEv2 account, it puts the ACMEv2 account into the ACMEv1 folder, with a symlink to it from ACMEv2.
The easiest way to deal with this is probably to delete directories if they're empty.
