I am trying to get the Azure integration (#6261) finished and through CI but I am having a dependency management issue with the requests package during testing.
As you can see here https://travis-ci.org/certbot/certbot/jobs/408774623#L704, there seems to be an installation issue with the Azure libraries using an older version of requests and can't run the tests.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
FWIW, the previous Azure PRs (from which this is based) didn't have this issue because they didn't have any tests.
