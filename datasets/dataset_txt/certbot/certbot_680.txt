I'm using Certbot with the --manual option on macOS Sierra version 10.12.6. This way i can use my own scripts.
I want to request another manual hook that can run after:
--manual-auth-hook
and
--manual-cleanup-hook
The hook must pass environment variable to indicate success/failure to our script.
This will allow us to do something incase of success/failure, specially if some errors were reported by the server.
