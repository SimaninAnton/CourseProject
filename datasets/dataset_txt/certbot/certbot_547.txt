This needs to before the next release. This is because pip gets mad if you include --require-hashes and not all packages have a listed hash. See letsencrypt-auto-source/pieces/dependency-requirements.txt and https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html#updating-certbot-auto-and-letsencrypt-auto for how to do this. If this doesn't make sense or doesn't seem interesting, I can take this myself.
