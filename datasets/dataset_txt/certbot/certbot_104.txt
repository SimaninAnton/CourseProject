As per this comment by Cloudflare staff, the new API keys functionality is in open beta. The feature allows creating multiple separate API tokens for each application with fine-grain permissions the user can apply. I recommend support for these new tokens be added to Certbot.
This feature uses a new authorization method: bearer tokens
(specifically Authorization: bearer :token).
Due to the change in the authentication method, certbot will have to account for users who were using the global API key previously, and users who want to use the global API key when setting up dns-cloudflare for the first time (since it's still in beta, I recommend keeping Global API key support).
I made a PR for changing the API tokens link about a month ago - #7052 - and while that is still the correct URL (even now for the Global API key) more text or instruction is probably needed to have the user choose either the global API key or one of the new API tokens.
