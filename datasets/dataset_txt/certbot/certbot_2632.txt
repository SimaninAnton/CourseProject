Hi,
I have been trying to run the Apache module, but unfortunately it is unable to parse some configuration files from OWASP's ModSecurity core ruleset. The problematic files can be found here:
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/master/base_rules/modsecurity_crs_60_correlation.conf
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/master/base_rules/modsecurity_crs_40_generic_attacks.conf
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/master/base_rules/modsecurity_crs_47_common_exceptions.conf
The error I am getting is:
PluginError: ('There has been an error in parsing the file (%s): %s', u'/etc/modsecurity/owasp-modsecurity-crs/activated_rules/modsecurity_crs_60_correlation.conf', u'Syntax error')
Temporarily removing those three files will solve the problem.
I am on Ubuntu 14.04 with mod_security2 installed.
Thanks for the great work!!
