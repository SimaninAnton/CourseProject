I recently got this error trying to issue a cert:
The client sent an unacceptable anti-replay nonce :: JWS has invalid anti-replay nonce
This happens from time to time - the server loses track of outstanding nonces. Since the reply always includes a fresh nonce, the client should auto-retry the request.
