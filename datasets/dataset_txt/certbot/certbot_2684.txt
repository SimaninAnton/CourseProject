Hi
It seems in letsencrypt-0.1.1, you missed this file
"letsencrypt/__ init __ .py" (i added space otherwise it will be edited by the editor)
it still point to 0.2.0.dev0
i suggest to make a quick release of 0.1.2 to fix this problem as the problem will not be spotted until the client runs letsencrypt command
