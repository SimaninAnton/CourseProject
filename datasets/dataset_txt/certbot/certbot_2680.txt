When executing the client, it tries to connect to the API via IPv6, which hangs indefinitely.
acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org also has AAAA records, which causes the client to try to connect to the API via IPv6. But the server does not accept connections via IPv6.
I ran strace on the process, which confirms this:
connect(4, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(443), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "2a02:26f0:7b:48f::3d5", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}
Right now, the client is unusable for me.
Is there any way to force it to use IPv4?
