The SimpleFS PR, got me thinking... that we really need a lightweight Installer. The main functionality of the Installer would be to restart a running webserver.
Use Case
Assuming, user's webserver isn't fully supported.
User wants to automate everything and is willing to help out the plugin.
Work Flow.
User uses the functionality of SimpleFS #757 to automatically get certificate. (Specifies the webroot)
User registers a restart command with the client, to autodeploy new certificates
Now renewal happens seamlessly. (The plugin can remember the webroot of the server) This updates the symlinks within storage.py (RenewableCert) and then the client just has to restart the webserver in order to deploy the new certificate.
The other calls would simply prompt instructions.
Your certificate is located here.... install this symlink on the target server. Press enter to continue
