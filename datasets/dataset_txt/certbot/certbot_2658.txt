I have successfully created a certificate using letsencrypt on one of my apache server.
https://mydomain.duckdns.org
On my second server, I just forward a different port (4430) to this machine, ie, accessible by:
https://mydomain.duckdns.org:4430
I tried the same procedure to install letsencrypt ./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d mydomain.duckdns.org on this machine but got this error:
 The following 'urn:acme:error:unauthorized' errors were reported by
  the server:

  Domains: mydomain.duckdns.org
  Error: The client lacks sufficient authorization
Question is, how can I use the cert created by letsencrypt on my first machine on my second machine?
