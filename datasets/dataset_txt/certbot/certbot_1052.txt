When I was generating the Sphinx documentation on my macOS with the make -C docs clean html man command, I was having import errors. I had to manually install repoze.sphinx.autointerface and sphinx_rtd_theme. I think this should be mentioned in the Developer Guide.
To install those packages I used the pip installer.
pip install repoze.sphinx.autointerface
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
