Feature request!
I'd like to have the option to log to one file only in the log_dir (or be able to specifically set a singular log and not have it rotate), this helps with docker logs ala nginx e.g. in Dockerfile
RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
OR have the ability to print the errors that would be in the log to stdout
