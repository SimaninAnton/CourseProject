letsencrypt 0.9.1
--webroot-path or -w options are being ignored.
The plugin still keeps prompting me to paste the verification code in well_known folder ?!?
certbot-auto certonly -a manual --rsa-key-size 4096 -v --email admin@example.com --staging --verbose --text --agree-tos --webroot-path /var/www/vhosts/example.com/main/htdocs/ -d example.com -d www.example.com
with --staging option it created the SSL stuff in .../live/ folder however the full chain contained something with Fake CA X1
Can you please make it super non-interactive.
--agree-send-ip
--agree-renew
I'd like to be able to automate this without the tool touching my vhosts.
update: it seems --webroot-path appliedto 'certonly' why don't you have it for manual mode as well?
Why make things (more) complicated when they can be simple?
