I ran into an issue want wanted to document my solution here in case anyone else runs into it. I used the latest cloud.linode.com dashboard to generate an API key to use with the dns-linode plugin. However, it seems that the keys generated there are not connected to the legacy manager.linode.com dashboard. You must log-in to the older interface in order to generate the correct type of token. Here's the error I got when running with the wrong type of token:
Unexpected error determining zone identifier for jonah.name: Linode api error: [{u'ERRORCODE': 4, u'ERRORMESSAGE': u'Authentication failed'}]
