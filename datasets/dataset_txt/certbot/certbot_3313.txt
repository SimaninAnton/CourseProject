Soon to be pulled in letsencrypt/boulder#774 implements the following ACME spec changes:
ietf-wg-acme/acme#6
ietf-wg-acme/acme#7
ietf-wg-acme/acme#8
ietf-wg-acme/acme#13
letsencrypt/boulder#774 doesn't break integration tests, but follow-up PRs that disable old challenges will break.
I'll work on acme and letsencrypt, using #895 as base (please review!). Volunteers are necessary for letsencrypt-apache and letsencrypt-nginx follow-up PRs.
