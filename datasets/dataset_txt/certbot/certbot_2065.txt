Run the client with the certonly or run subcommands and a fresh config.
When asked for an e-mail, provide one that passes the clients safe_email test but will fail when sent to boulder. I used <keyboard mashing>@<keyboard mashing>.com.
When asked for an e-mail again, cancel. The client will register without an e-mail address.
