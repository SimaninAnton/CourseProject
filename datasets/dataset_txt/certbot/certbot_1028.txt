Reported by @src386 here:
In an nginx config, if you specify server_names_hash_bucket_size outside of a server block, we'll fail the challenge. This is because we only search for the directive in the specific server block rather than checking if it was inherited from elsewhere in the config.
While we could do something like removing the directive if we fail to restart nginx after adding it and trying again, the correct solution would be a dramatic change in our parser to be able to properly handle inherited directives.
