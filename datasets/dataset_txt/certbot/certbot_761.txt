My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 17.10
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Docker
I ran this command and it produced this output:
docker run -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt -v /var/log/letsencrypt:/var/log/letsencrypt -it certbot/certbot --version
certbot 0.21.1
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Let's Encrypt supports 61 million domains (
https://letsencrypt.org/2017/12/07/looking-forward-to-2018.html
). I don't know what percentage of those use certbot to get their certs, but my wild-ass guess would be >50%.
Software that is used in production by tens of millions of sites should not be marked as "pre-production" software with version 0.x. It's not 100% clear that certbot follows the Semantic Versioning standard, but here's the suggestion from semver.org on when to release 1.0.0 (https://semver.org/#how-do-i-know-when-to-release-100):
How do I know when to release 1.0.0?
If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable > API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If youâ€™re worrying a lot about
backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
No output to the logs, AFAICT
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
