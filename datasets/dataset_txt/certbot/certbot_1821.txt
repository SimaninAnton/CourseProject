hello i would like to make a small bug report regarding the manual.
inside the text of the manual there is a passage:
The --force-renew flag may be helpful for automating renewal; it causes the expiration time of the certificate(s) to be ignored when considering renewal, and attempts to renew each and every installed certificate regardless of its age. (This form is not appropriate to run daily because each certificate will be renewed every day, which will quickly run into the certificate authority rate limit.)
if continued to scroll down however, one can see that there is no "--force-renew" but only a "--force-renewal" parameter.
--force-renewal, --renew-by-default
If a certificate already exists for the requested
domains, renew it now, regardless of whether it is
near expiry. (Often --keep-until-expiring is more
appropriate). Also implies --expand. (default: False)
it confused at least me so much that i now use --renew-by-default instead of the other one(s). maybe someone wanna fix that. thank you for your attention.
