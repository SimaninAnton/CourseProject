My operating system is (include version):
debian_version 8.8
Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1 (2016-12-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --apache
I have two different apache configuration files for two different ports but only one file was reconfigured.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expect both will be changed or tool allow manage it in any way (for example: showing the port on available domain names list to select witch will be configured)
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
