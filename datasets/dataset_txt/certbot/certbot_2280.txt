In Gentoo, Define's are passed by the initscript as -D arguments read in /etc/conf.d/apache
LE seems to ignore that. As a result, since the "Listen 443" directive is inside IfDefine blocks, it is systematically overlooked by LE since it doesn't know about the active Define directives.
LE will therefore add a "Listen 443" temporary directive, which will cause apache to fail with a "could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:443" error. LE in turn will fail with "urn:acme:error:connection" since apache is not running during the challenge.
