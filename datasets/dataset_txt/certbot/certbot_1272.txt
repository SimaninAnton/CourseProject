My operating system is (include version):
macOS 10.12.4
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
MacPorts 2.4.1 (package maintainer)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot --help

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Help message was not printed. This is just a quick proof of concept sample, but this happens for any invocation of certbot 0.13.0. BTW, certbot 0.12.0 works as expected.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
