My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./letsencrypt-auto --version
Upgrading certbot-auto 0.24.0 to 0.25.1...
Couldn't download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/v0.25.1/letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto. HTTP Error 404: Not Found
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Download and Upgrade to the latest version.
