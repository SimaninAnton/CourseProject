My operating system is (include version):
Raspbian 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto
Error while running apache2ctl configtest.
Action 'configtest' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.
apache2: Syntax error on line 219 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 32 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default-le-ssl.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf: No such file or directory
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
What I was I was hoping to have happen is for it to ask me my domain name, but it just gave errors. was switching domains and instead of running certbot-auto delete I deleted folders for certbot. I'm very new to this and I haven't even been operating a web server for more the two weeks. What is the solution to this? Fresh install of certbot? How would I go about that?
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
