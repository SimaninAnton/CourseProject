As mentioned in #4792 nginx gives a somewhat useless error when you have a default configuration lacking a server_name directive with the appropriate domain name. While documenting how to mitigate this is useful, we should probably just handle this case - by making an appropriate vhost, like we do with apache and running the challenge.
