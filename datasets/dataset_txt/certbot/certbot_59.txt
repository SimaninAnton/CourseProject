OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3
CertBot: 0.31.0
CertBot source: official repository
What I did:
Tried renewing existing certificate of an IDN.
What happened:
It exited claiming NXDOMAIN, which is blatantly false because both unicode and punycode versions resolve using not-certbot and also on different machines.
CertBot error output: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for ex\xfcmple.com which seems like it converts Ã¼ incorrectly.
What I expected to happen:
CertBot to renew the cert that was even once acquired.
