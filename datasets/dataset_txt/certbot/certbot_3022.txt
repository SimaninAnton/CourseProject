There's an extremely dramatic security warning comment in the function temp_install in the apache plugin.
This function performs a filesystem copy operation. AFAICT the source file is controlled by setuptools and the destination is within the apache configuration directory controlled by the command line and/or a Let's Encrypt configuration file.
Since Let's Encrypt is not designed to perform privileged operations for unprivileged users, command lines or configuration files, I believe this is an utter non-issue. But I'd like someone to check my reasoning on this.
