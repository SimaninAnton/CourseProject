In certbot-apache's constants.py, the client expects "gentoo base system" as key for the OS-specific defaults. However, os_info[0] is "gentoo". As a result, certbot-apache fails with "Unable to find Apache version" since it relies on the non-working debian defaults.
I am not sure, but I feel that "gentoo base system" is a leftover from letsencrypt-auto which tested for distribution-specific files, such as /etc/gentoo-release which indeed contains that string. In contrast, certbot seems to rely on /etc/os-release, which only mentions "gentoo".
Therefore, I suggest that "gentoo base system" be changed to simply "gentoo". At least it fixes the problem for me.
