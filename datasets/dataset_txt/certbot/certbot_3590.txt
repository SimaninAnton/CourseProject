For renewal, we may want to renew even when only a subset of the subject names in an existing cert can be renewed successfully.
In the normal certificate issuance case, we abandon the attempt to obtain the cert if the CA tells us that we failed to obtain authorization for any requested subject name. But for renewal, this might not be our preferred behavior. Instead, we may want to be able to proceed with requesting issuance for the successfully-authorized subset of subject names.
In this case we need a way to specify this behavior and to report back to the caller to indicate which names were successfully issued for and which names couldn't be issued for (and, if the information is available, why not).
