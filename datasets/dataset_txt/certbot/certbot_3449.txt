Tried out letsencrypt the first time. Unless I missed something obvious in the install doc, the following essential dirs and files were not there at first-run (./venv/bin/letsencrypt auth)
/etc/letsencrypt/
/etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
/var/log/letsencrypt/
/var/lib/letsencrypt/
Bootstrap script should've created them with the specific permissions.
Also, the documentation should specify when ./venv/bin/letsencrypt should be run with sudo, and when not.
