The issue I was having at #503 (Error creating new authz) looks to be resolved, but now every time I try to run letsencrypt, I get the following:
$ sudo ./venv/bin/letsencrypt -d jn1.me auth
Traceback (most recent call last):

Deleting my /etc/letsencrypt/accounts/ doesn't help, nor does removing and reinstalling letsencrypt. I noticed that the response to dig jn1.me -t TYPE257 @lucy.ns.cloudflare.com is the same "REFUSED" status as before; could that be the reason?
