I have successfully obtained ssl certificates from letsencrypt and they are working. But when I try to check for renewal it always fails
I used ./letsencrypt-auto renew --dry-run to check whether certificate renewal is working or not. But it fails everytime without any error message. Any help on how can I find the reasons behind this failure ?
We are deploying letsencrypt .pem certs to tomcat by converting them to jks. So I need renewal only for my cert files.
Could it be because my certificate is not going to expire for some time ? If that's the case then how can I test whether I can renew my certificate or not ?
