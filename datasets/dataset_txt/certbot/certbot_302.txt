If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu Server 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Don't remember mixed up
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I set cronjob for certbot renew --noninteractive
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
