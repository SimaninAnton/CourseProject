Hello,
An issue I encountered today: the rewrite rules added to apache config by certbot-auto to coerce http requests to https doesn't seem to be bulletproof.
In particular, GET params that are url-encoded, eg ?email=testest%2Byhbugfixer%40gmail.com, seem to end up getting encoded twice so that my application receives 'testest%2Byhbugfixer%40gmail.com' for the param value instead of the intended 'testest+yhbugfixer@gmail.com', if I make the initial request in http://
Notably, this does not happen if in place of the rewrite rules added by certbot-auto, I simply create a new virtual host like so:
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName mydomain.com
Redirect / https://mydomain.com/
</VirtualHost>
