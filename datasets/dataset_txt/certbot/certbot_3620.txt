On my system (Ubuntu 14.04), initial invocation of tox (in a virtualenv, after python setup.py install) works successfully, but all subsequent invocations fail immediately with
AssertionError: Egg-link /home/schoen/src/lets-encrypt-preview does not match installed location of letsencrypt (at /home/schoen/src/lets-encrypt-preview/.tox/lint/lib/python2.7/site-packages)
However, removing the entire letsencrypt/.tox directory will get rid of this error (at the cost of having to rebuild all of the packages that tox brings in), but then running tox a second time brings the error message back.
