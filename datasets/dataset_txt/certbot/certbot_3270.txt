I haven't had the time yet to investigate this in more detail, but I just experienced the following behavior. I:
From a clean LE install, ran letsencrypt -t. Nginx was not installed so Apache was automatically chosen. I received and installed my cert.
I added these lines to /etc/letsencrypt/renewer.conf:
renew_before_expiry = 10 years
deploy_before_expiry = 10 years
I ran letsencrypt-renewer.
After doing this, messages at every log level were output to STDERR. This is not expected or desired behavior.
