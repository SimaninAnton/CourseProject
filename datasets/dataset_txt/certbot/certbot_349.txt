While #6474 allowed Certbot's DNS plugins based on Lexicon to continue to work with the changes mentioned in #6472, Certbot prints the message "Legacy configuration object has been used to load the ConfigResolver." to our users on every run.
We should hide/suppress this message or fix the problem so it no longer appears.
This has less priority for me than #6474 which prevents breakage for the small number of distros who will quickly upgrade Lexicon, however, it would be great if we could squelch this warning before our next release as well.
