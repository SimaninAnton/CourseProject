This may be "working as intended," or "too much hassle to fix, since it would involve overlapping arg parsers," but I figured I'd post for discussion:
I have a cron job that runs certbot-auto -q renew. Normally it produces no output, but on the most recent run, it printed (and therefore emailed me):
Upgrading certbot-auto 0.10.2 to 0.11.0...
Replacing certbot-auto...
Creating virtual environment...
Installing Python packages...
Installation succeeded.
Expected results: No output on self-upgrade when -q is present.
