To update to Fedora 29, we probably need to wait until 0.33.0 is released because test_leauto_upgrades.sh tests upgrading from an old version of certbot-auto to the current version but the current version of certbot-auto is the only version that supports this OS.
To upgrade to Fedora 28, we may want to resolve #6828 and #6830 first so ideally all tests will pass on the image.
