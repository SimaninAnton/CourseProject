Right now my understanding is that we never create a RenewableCert lineage with a renewal config and associated files within /etc/letsencrypt unless we installed the cert into a server with configuration changes via an installer plugin.
Some discussions on the forum seem to suggest that this may be too restrictive because people might want renewable lineages to exist and be available for use with their own server configurations (like servers that we don't officially support via installers). This makes sense and I think @jdkasten and I had considered this possibility before.
Is this right? How should it work? How should users choose this behavior as opposed to just saving the PEM files in their working directory?
