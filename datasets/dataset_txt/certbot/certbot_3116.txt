I'd like to see a bit more clarification about exactly who the copyright holders are for the code as it currently stands. The documentation has 2014-2015, Let's Encrypt Project, while the LICENSE file says that it's 2015, EFF "and others". I don't mind the generic blanket "and others" (though probably I'd use the language "contributors"), but Debian will want more clarity around who exactly owns the code, not just that it's Apache-2.0.
2014-2015, Let's Encrypt Contributors would work.
@pde, this is probably in your lap?
