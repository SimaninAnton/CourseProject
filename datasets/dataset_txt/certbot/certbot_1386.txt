I have the following issue: Chrome browser (both desktop and mobile) shows me "Not Secure" label for my main domain "https://astrakhan.ru/" while it works OK for "https://www.astrakhan.ru/". Firefox and IE work just fine. What causes the problem? Chrome shows me only "net::ERR_UNEXPECTED" error but this doesn't seem to be any helpful.
