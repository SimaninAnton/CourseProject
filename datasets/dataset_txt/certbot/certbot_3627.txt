from LICENSE.txt:
"""
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"""
I didn't find such a copyright notice anywhere in the project.
So, while it maybe can be assumed that LICENSE.txt shall apply to all project files and that the copyright holders might be all the people in AUTHORS.rst, this maybe rather should be told explicitely.
AFAIK / IANAL. :)
Also, there could be another section in the docs including that information and the license.
