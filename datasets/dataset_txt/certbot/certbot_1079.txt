Boulder no longer supports phone number as a contact method - should acme be updated to remove the phone number functionality in Registration (ie. NewRegistration & UpdateRegistration classes)?
I ran into this while building an in-house client using acme. Because the documentation for acme is sparse, reading its source code, experimenting, and seeing how other clients (including certbot) do things is the only viable way to achieve results.
For completeness, here's the error returned from LetsEncrypt staging:
urn:acme:error:malformed :: The request message was malformed :: Unable to update registration :: contact method tel is not supported
Of course, I remove my references to 'phone' from my client implementation and things are working now - but still, it should probably be deprecated.
