I generated a couple Let's Encrypt certs with the default settings. Then I realized that the default RSA key size is 2048, whereas I prefer to be paranoid and use 4096-bit keys. No problem! I just revoked the old certs and went to reissue new ones, passing --rsa-key-size.
It was at this point that I got a prompt telling me that I had a certificate with exactly the same domain name on it, and did I want to keep the existing cert? This is obviously wrong as the certificate is revoked and thus no longer useful.
% letsencrypt --version
