Let's Encrypt is awesome! Free SSL for everyone!
The letsencrypt-auto utility is very easy to use if you're able to run it on the same machine that is hosting your website. Unfortunately, shared hosting is still very popular and often does not allow/provide shell access. This directly conflicts with ISRG's core mission:
ISRGâ€™s mission is to reduce financial, technological, and education barriers to secure communication over the Internet.
To address that, I propose a web-based interface, hosted on letsencrypt.org, that allows webmasters to generate SSL certificates that they can copy-paste into cPanel. There are some third-party solutions out there, but since the security of the private key is essential for SSL to work, it would be best if the issuer (LE) hosted the service themselves.
I propose something like certs.letsencrypt.org where:
A webmaster can create an account linked with their email address;
They can initiate a certificate request;
They are then told how to go about verifying their control of the domain(s);
Once verified, the certificate and private keys are generated, and they can then copy-paste them into cPanel;
They are automatically emailed a series of notices when their cert is about to expire, along with a link or instructions to sign back into the website and renew their cert.
