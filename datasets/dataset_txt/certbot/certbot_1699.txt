Running Certbot with --dry-run can cause expiration e-mails from staging. How?
If you do not yet have a staging account and you've provided an e-mail address on the command line or in a configuration file, Certbot will use that e-mail address when creating a new account, resulting in expiration e-mails from staging.
If you already have a staging account, Certbot uses it. If this staging account has an e-mail address registered to it, you will receive expiration e-mails (unless you've unsubscribed).
We should fix this, first by never using an e-mail address with --dry-run and second by always creating a new, temporary staging account, which is not saved to disk.
