Recommendation: certbot's command line exit status codes should be added to the user documentation.
Use case: I have a shell script that does something when certbot updates the certificates that are about to expire. The easiest way I could think to do that would be to run the cerbot renew command, and check its exit status.
I observe that the exit code is 1 when the certbot did not need to update the certs. I assume the status would be 0 when it does update the certs. Users could possibly also add contingencies to their scripts and tools in case something went wrong and there were other status codes.
