The current default constants for Gentoo fail on systems that are using systemd as init system.
This is because control script in Apache package expects OpenRC based init scripts. It might be feasible to handle the httpd restarts and configuration dumps using the systemd service.
@Jarodiv you have previously been active on this front, so maybe you have some insight on the following points:
What would be the sensible way to fingerprint the systemd installation? Just finding out if systemctl exists?
What does the systemd service for Apache in Gentoo look like? Does it use the values from /etc/conf.d/apache2 variables in command line like it does on OpenRC systems?
Do we have a way to run configtest on the httpd with the correct command line?
cc @osirisinferi as you have been active on Gentoo front also.
