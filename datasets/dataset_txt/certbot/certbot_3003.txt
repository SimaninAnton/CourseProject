Shortly before requesting my first certificate I moved the domain to a different host. This resulted in the auto client failing with a generic error message that the authorization failed.
I had to run tcpdump on the old and the new server to figure out that the reason why the authorization failed was because the LE backend kept trying to connect to the old IP address.
Obviously it is not a good idea to change IP address before questing certificates, but I think it could save some users hours of debugging if the authorization error message would include the IP and port number the LE backend tried to connect to.
