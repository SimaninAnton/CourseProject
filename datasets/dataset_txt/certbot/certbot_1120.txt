While Augeas saved us writing a grammar for Apache config files, it has caused us a lot of other issues. Off the top of my head:
hercules-team/augeas#423
hercules-team/augeas#435
hercules-team/augeas#466
hercules-team/augeas#467
hercules-team/augeas#470
hercules-team/python-augeas#15
hercules-team/python-augeas#21
and recently hercules-team/python-augeas#30
There are also well over a dozen bugs that have been found in their Apache configuration parsing that have subsequently been fixed. While upstream has always been willing to help (and their help has been greatly appreciated), we continue to have issues, some of which are quite serious. Even worse, issues like hercules-team/python-augeas#15 have sat around for over a year with no signs of progress.
While Augeas has been useful for us, I think it's time we investigate finding another library for parsing Apache configuration files. Ideally, this library should not be reliant on any non-Python libraries or programs as this dramatically simplifies packaging.
