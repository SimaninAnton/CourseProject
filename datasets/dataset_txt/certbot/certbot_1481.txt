Steps to reproduce:
Create a file in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default that contains two server { } blocks, each with a different server_name
Run certbot-auto --nginx
Expected result:
Prompted to activate HTTPS for both server_names.
Actual result:
Prompted to activate HTTPS only for the first server_name.
