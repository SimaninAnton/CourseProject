I'm using the official Certbot docker image to auto renew certificates, everything works flawless until I try to reload my load-balancer once the certificates are successfully renewed.
I can't use post-hook, because the Certbot and the load-balancer are in different containers, so there is not way for the Certbot to reload the load-balancer (well, unless you let Certbot have access to the docker daemon, but let's not do that).
I wonder if it's possible to let the renew command return a status 0 if it's successful, and something else if it didn't renew? Or maybe return different string to stdout based on different renew results?
