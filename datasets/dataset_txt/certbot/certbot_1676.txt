It's not maintained and the owner chose to delete the project because no one offered to take it over. It was reuploaded to PyPI when everyone's builds broke, but we might want to look into removing this dependency entirely to prevent more problems in the future.
See lunaryorn/sphinxcontrib-programoutput#10 for more information.
