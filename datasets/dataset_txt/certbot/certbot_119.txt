This may be a silly question but
How do you make changes to the repository "locally" and test it out?? For example, say I ws trying to check if we can add the EAB for certmanager by referring to Lego repository,
https://github.com/go-acme/lego/blob/master/acme/api/account.go (Line 30)
But for that how do I proceed? How do I edit the code locally and then create the Docker Image out of it and then use those Docker images?
Say if I add a couple of functions in the account.go or somewhere else, how do I make my current certmanager setup use those new changes?
