The thing is that cert paths are usually copied to another place (web server configs etc).
Now the successful output looks like this:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert
   will expire on 2666-06-06. To obtain a new or tweaked version of
   this certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot-auto renew"
Notice a dot after the cert path which is being selected after the double-click on the terminal:
I would also include a key path there, it is needed in most usecases (ssl_certificate_key in nginx). Now, I have to manually change fullchain.pem to privkey.pem in the cert path.
I think the following format would be way more usable:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem
   Key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2666-06-06. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run
   certbot-auto again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your
   certificates, run "certbot-auto renew"
What do you think?
