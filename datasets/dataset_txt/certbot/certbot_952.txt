My operating system is (include version):
Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
letsencrypt --apache -d redacted-domain.usa.cc
...
An unexpected error occurred:
There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: too many certificates already issued for: usa.cc
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected a certificate to be issued.
usa.cc is used by many (too many?) people because of free subdomains - maybe it needs a rate limit exception?
