I recently used the certbot NGINX plugin & webroot authenticator in order to protect my public sites (which worked like a charm btw. so huge Kudos!).
The only improvement request I would have is, that certbot automatically did motifications to my NGINX site configuration files. As I have quite a few of those files, Iâ€˜d like to keep them clean, by e.g. having the listen directive as a first statement in the server block. After certbot changed the configuration, the listen 80; lines have been removed and the new listen 443 line was appended to the bottom of the server block. I manually had to move it to the top again.
Therefore my suggestion would be, in case a line is removed and replaced by another directive, would it be possible to replace it in the original location of the removed line? That would keep also large configurations more clean! Thanks.
