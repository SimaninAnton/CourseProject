When running certbot renew it shows following info (paths truncated):
The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
It would be muchmore useful if it said when the certificates are going to expire and when they are due to renewal. For example:
The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped; exp. 2017-12-01, renew 2017-11-01)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped; exp. 2017-12-05, renew 2017-11-05)
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem (skipped; exp. 2017-11-01, renew 2017-10-01)
No renewals were attempted.
