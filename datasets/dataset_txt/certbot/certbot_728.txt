I have a question regarding the new support in Let's Encrypt for wildcard certificates. As they announced.
ACME v2 and wildcard support will be fully available on February 27, 2018
However, they also say the following.
Let’s Encrypt will begin issuing wildcard certificates in January of 2018. Wildcard certificates are a commonly requested feature and we understand that there are some use cases where they make HTTPS deployment easier. Our hope is that offering wildcards will help to accelerate the Web’s progress towards 100% HTTPS.
I would like to know if cerbot is already is prepared for this, and if so, is there a way to test it?
