Is it possible to know my quota status?
Isn't there an argument (I couldn't find) to achieve that without actually create a certificate?
In my context, in the hosting control panel, I should ask for our quota status and, if already at the max, explain the users the situation and that they have to wait a few days in order to be able to create their owncloud instance (and have their certificate created and the owncloud only accessible via https).
Thanks
