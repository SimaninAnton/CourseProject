Python 3.9 is planning on enforcing that abstract base classes in the collections module are imported from collections.abc. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections.
We currently are not always doing this in Certbot and are ignoring the deprecation warning about it at
certbot/pytest.ini
Line 16 in 6e07e8b
 ignore:.*collections\.abc:DeprecationWarning 
Properly testing and finding all occurrences of this problem is a little tricky (see #7691), but we should fix this and remove the pytest.ini entry well before Python 3.9 is released.
