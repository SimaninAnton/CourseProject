Hi,
First of all, congrats for the great work and the easiness of getting certificates!
The privkey.pem file generated has access rights that are too permissive:
-- in the keys/ directory, the private key rights are good
-rw-------. 1 root root 1704 Apr 21 01:20 0000_key-letsencrypt.pem
-- but archive/dom.ain.name/privkey1.pem is readable by everyone
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1704 Apr 21 01:20 privkey1.pem
We need to
chmod go-r archive/dom.ain.name/privkey{insert index here}.pem
I'm using latest git version, on CentOS 7
Hope it helps!
