Observed Behavior: Recipe:
Follow the letsencrypt-auto procedure to the point where it puts up a curses-based menu asking "How would you like to authenticate".
Select an answer, and then OK.
Observe that almost nothing changes. The question and the OK button remain on the screen. To all appearances, nothing has happened, and the question still needs answering. A super-astute observer might notice that the cursor has moved to the lower-left corner of the screen, but on my screen this is essentially imperceptible.
Many seconds later some visible progress occurs.
Desired and Expected Behavior: Suggestions:
Subtraction part: As soon as the OK button is pressed, the menu should go away.
Addition part: There should be a clear statement that the process has moved to the next step. For example, if the authentication process is about to begin, it might be appropriate to emit a line of text saying:
Authenticating (this may take a few seconds) ...
If we want to get fancy and give the user some feedback about what he just selected, that could be made explicit:
Authenticating via apache2 (this may take a few seconds) ...
Given how verbose other parts of the process are, this tiny bit of feedback would not be excessive.
Also:
The same ideas should apply to whatever other menus there are. User actions should provide immediate perceptible feedback.
