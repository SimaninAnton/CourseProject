I am possibly missing something here, but will try to point out my issue.
I used to have a cname record for www.twmicrosheep.com to twmicrosheep.com.
As invited to the closed beta test, I tried to get a ssl certificate for www.twmicrosheep.com.
It has the following errors.
Failed authorization procedure. www.twmicrosheep.com (dvsni): tls :: The server experienced a TLS error during DV :: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge
After some trials, I manage to get it to work by setting an A record to www.twmicrosheep.com then it can pass the challenge. I can then change it back to a cname record.
BTW, I am using cloudflare as my DNS provider.
