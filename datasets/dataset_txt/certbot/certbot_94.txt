I think there are some such as the use collections.Mapping here instead of collections.abc.Mapping.
There may not be any, but I had trouble getting all of our tests to pass as expected as described at #7333 (comment).
To run tests in Travis, you can probably make use of the 3.8-dev or nightly Python builds offered by Travis.
