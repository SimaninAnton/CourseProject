I was previously getting some expiration notice emails, like:
Hello,
Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 19 days (on 29 Feb 16 22:12 +0000). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your website will encounter errors.

If you are receiving this email in error, unsubscribe at http://mandrillapp.com/track/unsub.php?u=30850198&id=5a003f028561442[...]. (HTTP link, we know. We're working on it!)

I had issued multiple certs for the same domain and I wanted to let this particular certificate expire, so I clicked on the unsubscribe link. However I didn't realize that it would unsubscribe that email for all certificates I issued using that email address.
I suggest:
Add an additional link in the email to unsubscribe from notifications ONLY for that certificate (e.g. when you want to let it just expire and don't want to be notified every few days).
Allow users to re-subscribe if the link was accidentally clicked on.
