At the moment, the client makes use of a2enmod and a2dismod for enabling some mods in configurator.py. But these scripts are Debian (based distro's) only. At least: those scripts are unavailable on Gentoo.
Therefore, the Apache plugin is unavailable too.
It's not unlikely the required mods are already enabled on the server. As far as I can tell, Let's Encrypt just enables mod_ssl, mod_headers and mod_rewrite. But perhaps I'm missing something
Those are not very uncommon modules at all if I'm not mistaken. I would very much like to see some kind of check: if the required modules are already properly enabled, then the dependency on a2enmod and a2dismod could be dropped.
