Originally reported at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/renewal-process-crashed-my-production-server/51920/8, we should make sure that we always properly stop the standalone server. This is probably related to #5429. We should reproduce the problem and verify the solution to #5429 fixes it in the simple case.
We may also want look into adding code that more aggressively kills threads and child processes when Certbot tries to exit.
We should at least look into this problem and see if it's a regression for 0.22.0.
