I've got a crontab entry to renew the certs periodically but when it ran this month I got the cryptic error
 * Stopping web server apache2
 * 
Updating letsencrypt and virtual environment dependencies.......
Running with virtualenv: sudo /home/ubuntu/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly --standalone --email spiro.agnew@whitehouse.gov --agree-tos -d agnew.example.com
User chose to cancel the operation and may reinvoke the client.
 * Starting web server apache2

When after looking through the code found you needed a secret, undocumented option
--renew-by-default
on your "certonly" request to get it to actually work as you'd expect.
