My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.3
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
It self upgraded to 0.19.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbout-auto
No new domains detected in list, only the old previously detected ones.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
It does not detect new config files in apache2/sites-avaliable only the previos ones detected.
