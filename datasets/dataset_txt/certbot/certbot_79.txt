If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
There appears to be a bug that causes certbot-auto to end with Creating virtual environment... followed by OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory. A workaround to prevent this is to issue the additional command:
yum install python3-virtualenv
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot should not need a workaround to create a virtual environment
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
