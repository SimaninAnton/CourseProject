there are some docs on readthedocs, but currently only API docs, so non-developers looking there might be a bit disappointed.
my suggestion (and also I am offering to do it) is to move most of the README into the docs and only keep introductory information in the README.
About documentation structure: I have thought through and optimized this for one of my other projects and would suggest to do it in a similar way to avoid redundancies, see http://nsupdateinfo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsupdate-info/nsupdate.info/master/docs/intro.rst - you see that introduction chapter of the docs is just the README and the CHANGES from the toplevel dir included there.
What do you think?
