Trying to setup a SSL certificate for my hostname, however I run Apache on a different IP than the one the hostname points to and as I wish to automate my renewal process this forces me to use the standalone server option.
However, currently the client does not check the IP in use and only checks if the port is in use on the server. This means that I am not able to run a standalone server as Apache is currently listening on another IP on the ports 80 & 443.
