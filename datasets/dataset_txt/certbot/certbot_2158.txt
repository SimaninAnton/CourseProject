So I stumbled upon an interesting scenario and need some help quite quickly because I can no longer access my encrypted site :/
Basically, I created the following SSL certificate for
cloud.mysite.org
All was workng well and then I decided I wanted to provide that for the actual main site so I did..
./letsencrypt-auto apache -d cloud.mysite.org -d www.mysite.org
But this in fact caused the certificate and browsers to get confused. I realize now (perhaps it's a bug) but the second item should have been at the start no vic versa. I no longer was receiving a 'safe' certificate on the subdomain.
So then I revoked the certificate locally and attempted to create a new one. Ironically, no matter what I do the certificate is ALWAYS regenerated with the www.mysite.org even though I have another certificate specifically just for that.
Any help would be super awesome!!
