On a completely fresh, up-to-date Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Server) installation, Certbot cannot be installed from the Certbot PPA. The installation fails with ‘unmet dependencies’.
I am following the instructions at https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuartful-nginx.
Command-line conversation after having done sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot and updated the APT package cache follows.
ubuntu@pingu:~$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

 python-certbot-nginx : Depends: python3-certbot-nginx but it is not going to be installed

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

I expect this package install to work, or if I am missing some prerequisites perhaps the Certbot instructions should mention them. Thank you!
