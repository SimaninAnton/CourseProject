In https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/acme/acme/client.py#L326, we only check for STATUS_VALID. We should also check for STATUS_INVALID and return once that happens, or there will be many clients looping forever making requests to the server.
Similarly, that method should have a timeout.
