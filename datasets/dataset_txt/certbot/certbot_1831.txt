The shebang in file: /usr/local/Cellar/certbot/0.8.1/libexec/bin/certbot is:
!/usr/bin/python
when it should be:
!/usr/bin/env python
This is causing a variety of unexpected behaviors for those who are not using the supplied OSX python install as pip is not installing dependancies there. So while the system is reporting the dependancies are present, certbot is running from a python without them or with older versions.
For some myself this manifested as:
AttributeError: 'EntryPoint' object has no attribute 'resolve'
