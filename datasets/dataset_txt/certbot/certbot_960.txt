My operating system is (include version):
RHEL 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot certonly
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
My Virtual machine can access to interent only via proxy.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
An unexpected error occurred:
ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error(101, 'Network is unreachable'))
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
Is it possible to set proxy for certbot?
