My operating system is (include version):
Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
/opt/letsencrypt/certbot-auto xxxx
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Logs print in UTC. When debugging Cron the time is not close to being local time. This will effect automation, debugging, and time associations in other logs (webserver logs, cron, or others)
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
