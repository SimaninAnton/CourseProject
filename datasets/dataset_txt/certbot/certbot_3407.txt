With the letsencrypt client I see you can pass specific Nginx --nginx-server-root and `--nginx-ctl1 parameters but I assume the tool has also made specific assumptions about where nginx vhost files will be located etc and the format they take ? For non-standard Nginx configurations what would I need to do ? Can I tell the letsscrypt client to look for my specific custom Nginx paths and locations ? or would I need to use standalone method and then script it to place the obtained SSL certs and files in my custom locations ?
For instance on my Centmin Mod LEMP stack and example newdomain2.com, my nginx SSL configuration is located at /usr/local/nginx/conf/conf.d/newdomain2.com.ssl.conf with install for Nginx at /usr/local/nginx and SSL certificates end up in directory at /usr/local/nginx/conf/ssl/newdomain2.com. Example of how newdomain2.com Nginx vhost was generated.
Basically, I am looking to integrate letsencrypt into my Nginx vhost creation routine :)
thanks
