Currently, the two files that would need to be added to apache are:
cert.pem
chain.pem
privkey.pem
and nginx are
fullchain.pem
privkey.pem
Looking at https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html and https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-apache.htm, it would appear that Apache requires SSLCertificateFile, SSLCertificateKeyFile, and SSLCertificateChainFile. These would be cert.pem, privkey.pem, and chain.pem, respectively.
Looking at https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-nginx.htm, it would appear that Nginx requires ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key. These would be fullchain.pem and privkey.pem, respectively.
I propose renaming the files to something that better matches what the documentations state for the settings. In my mind, what makes sense would be renaming fullchain.pem to certificatebundle.pem (or certbundle.pem to keep it short) and renaming privkey.pem to certificatekey.pem (or `certkey.pem to keep it short).
