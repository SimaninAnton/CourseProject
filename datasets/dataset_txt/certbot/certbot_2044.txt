Issue on an up-to-date Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
Updated openSSL to 1.0.2h(newest), didnt help.
also tried openSSL versions 1.0.1f, 1.0.1t(newest), 1.0.1s; none worked.
rm (..)/.local/share/letsencrypt -R didn't help (https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/undefined-symbol-x509-verify-param-set1-ip-asc/4251)
