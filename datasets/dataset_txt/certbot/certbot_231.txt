Let's Encrypt is turning off TLS-SNI-01 tomorrow, this challenge is no longer part of the ACME spec, and we have deprecated our support for a while. I think it's time to delete a lot of code.
I think we should:
Remove all tests using TLS-SNI-01
Remove any special code configuring boulder to still offer TLS-SNI-01 during tests
Remove code in Certbot and its plugins for performing TLS-SNI-01
Remove unit tests in Certbot and its plugins for performing TLS-SNI-01
And that may be it for now.
I think we should be a little careful in acme. Do we really want code like:
if isinstance(foo, acme.challenges.TLSSNI01):
to suddenly blow up? Code like this has never printed deprecation warnings.
I'm happy to talk about the acme stuff, but I think we may want to talk about how to remove that separately.
