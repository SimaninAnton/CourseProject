Currently, when you run commands like letsencrypt --help install, you get the following output:
$ letsencrypt --help install  
usage: 
  letsencrypt [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [domains]

The Let's Encrypt agent can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By
default, it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing
the cert.  

positional arguments:
  SUBCOMMAND
    run                 Obtain a certificate and install.
    auth                Authenticate & obtain cert, but do not install it.
    install             Install a previously obtained cert in a server.
    revoke              Revoke a previously obtained certificate.
    rollback            Rollback server configuration changes made during
                        install.
    config_changes      Show changes made to server config during installation
    plugins             List server software plugins.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        config file path (default: None)

install:
  Options for modifying how a cert is deployed
This to me doesn't seem very helpful. The problem is arguments shared between subcommands. Most of these common flags are now in the paths argument subgroup. I think ideally, the common arguments should not be duplicated when running letsencrypt --help all, but should be shown when running help for a specific subcommand. I do not believe this behavior is achievable with argparse and adds a fair amount of complexity, so we shouldn't worry about doing anything like this for now.
Instead, a simple thing we could do is update the description for the relevant subgroups to point users towards the paths group. I'm not sure what other simple fixes could be done here, but I don't think the help for commands like install and revoke does much to help the user right now.
