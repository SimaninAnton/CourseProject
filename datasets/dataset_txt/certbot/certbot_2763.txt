Yesterday I've tried to generate cert for disco.homenet.org and got the following error:
There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: homenet.org
I thought it's because homenet.org is not in the Public Suffix list so today I tried it with disco.myds.me (myds.me IS in the public suffix list) and got practically the same error:
There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: myds.me
Now what?
