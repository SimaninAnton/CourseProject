Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot via cloning the master repo
It seems that --cert-name does only work for renew. Not for creating new certs. Bug or feature?
The output when i try to create a non existing cert with: /opt/certbot/certbot-auto certonly --cert-name myname ... is something like the file in /etc/letsencrypt/myname... does not exist and then it stops - but why not create a new one if it not exists?
