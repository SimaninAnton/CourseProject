It seems that acme defines wrappers for various OpenSSL classes in order to get correct comparable behaviour. However, _pyopenssl_cert_or_req_san() uses isinstance to determine whether or not the passed object is a certificate or a request. Due to the wrapping this check gets the incorrect answer and will eventually cause OpenSSL to throw an error.
