Hi,
on automated systems with a lot of domains a single unsupported TLD (like dotbit) causes an error with the need to manage the affected bunch of domains manually.
An unexpected error occurred:
The request message was malformed :: Error creating new authz :: Name does not end in a public suffix
Please add a parameter to the ACME client which lists the allowed TLDs in a script-comptatible style to pre-filter allowed TLDs in cron-scripts.
