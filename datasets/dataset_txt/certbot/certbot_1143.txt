My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.02 LTS (4.4.0-72)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Certbot-auto, currently using version 0.14.2
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Running certbot-auto produces this output. There are lots of openssl references in there, and I believe my problem might be because I'm using OpenSSL 1.1.0f. However, I thought certbot supported OpenSSL 1.1.0 as of at least a few months ago (though I don't know).
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Certbot fails to bootstrap and will not start.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
N/A - certbot doesn't get far enough to start logging and so the log contains no information
Speculation follows
I'm using OpenSSL 1.1.0f and I suspect this is the problem.
