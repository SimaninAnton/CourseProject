CertBot is apparently not currently usable on sites hosted on multiple servers.
The ACME server does not properly check for all A records on a particular domain.
In my configuration, I have:
www IN A 167.114.139.43
www IN A 167.114.139.44
www IN A 167.114.139.45
Only one of these machines will be able to obtain a certificate (until the TTL expires).
