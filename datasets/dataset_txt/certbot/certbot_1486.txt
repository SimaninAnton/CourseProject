The cause of #4044 is that although setUpClass wasn't added until Python 2.7, nose manually runs this method for us. We should make sure our tests catch problems like this in the future.
Options:
Stop using nose and rely either on standard Python scripts for running tests or use another program to run our tests.
Use another test (perhaps like my hacky script here) and make sure it runs regularly on a Python 2.6 system.
