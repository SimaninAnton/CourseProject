With this daily crontab command I am getting email notifications how the renewal process went on:
20 3 * * * certbot renew --noninteractive --renew-hook /root/letsencrypt.sh
Unfortunately I get emailed every day which is too much for me. Is there a hidden parameter to have it email me only on failures? Not on success. Below is an example of that email. Using certbot v0.17.0 installed via apt-get here on Ubuntu 17.10
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
