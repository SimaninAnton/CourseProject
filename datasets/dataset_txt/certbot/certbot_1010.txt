My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get install certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http --rsa-key-size 8192 -d mydomain.com
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The request message was malformed :: Invalid key in certificate request :: key too large: 8192 > 4096
But I can't find any faq/docs with key-size limits
this is certbot limits or let's encrypt limits?
