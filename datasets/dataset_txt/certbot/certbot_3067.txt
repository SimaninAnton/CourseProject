(Or, "Dude, where's my sudo?")
As it stands, if you don't have sudo, you're toasted. The default in Debian is to not install sudo for bare-metal installations. As such, a Debian Jesse/stable minimalist installation doesn't have sudo, because there's a password set for root.
Should letsencrypt-auto depend on sudo? Or just say "Run me as root"? Or, optionally list the packages that need to be installed?
For completeness, this is the entire output from letsencrypt-auto:
indrora@zaibatsutel:~/letsencrypt$ ./letsencrypt-auto 
Bootstrapping dependencies for Debian-based OSes...
./letsencrypt-auto: 40: ./letsencrypt-auto: sudo: not found
Alternately, would a message of "sudo isn't there, using su -c '...'" be appropriate?
