I get to this step successfully:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
/etc/letsencrypt/live/inchworm.io/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
expire on 2016-04-11. To obtain a new version of the certificate in
the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
When I look in the /live folder it's empty. What details could I provide to help solve this issue since I need to update the cert in heroku from here.
Thanks.
