There are a bunch of cases where for various reasons people want to change Certbot's directories, including running as non-root, testing things, and even performance through parallelism. The UI for that is quite awkward, with three flags (--config-dir, --work-dir and --logs-dir) that the user has to provide.
Perhaps we should support a --certbot-dir flag that sets --config-dir, but also sets --work-dir to something like $CONFIG_DIR/state and --logs-dir to $CONFIG_DIR/logs, so the user only needs to set one flag.
