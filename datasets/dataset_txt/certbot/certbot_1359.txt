The system does not provide "requests[security]>=2.10". Interesting is, that the tests run nicely on the same systems.
My operating system is (include version):
openSUSE Leap 42.1
I installed Certbot with OS package manager:
python-acme-0.12.0-6.1.noarch
python-certbot-0.12.0-7.1.noarch
python-certbot-apache-0.12.0-7.1.noarch
certbot-0.12.0-7.1.noarch
I ran this command and it produced this output:

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
certbot should work
