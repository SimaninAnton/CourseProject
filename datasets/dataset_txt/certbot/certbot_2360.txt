I have received an expriation notification email for a domain that I had already renewed about a week ago:
Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 6 days (on 04 Mar 16 09:50 +0000). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your website will encounter errors.
I have verified the expiration date in the browser. The renewed cert was issued on 2016-02-17 12:27:00 CET and is valid through 2016-05-17 13:27:00 CEST.
