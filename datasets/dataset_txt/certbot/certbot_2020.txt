The following command in letsencrypt early version:
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone --agree-tos --email me@domain.com --renew-by-default --rsa-key-size 4096 --standalone-supported-challenges http-01 -d domain.com -d sub.domain.com
I've had an old script that expect it to create a folder in /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com. But now it creates in /etc/letsencrypt/live/sub.domain.com. Which broke my whole website.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/content.rosegarden.se/fullchain.pem. Your
   cert will expire on 2016-09-08. To obtain a new or tweaked version
   of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto again.
   To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot-auto renew"

I'm trying to make certbot to create the folder /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com instead of the sub domain /etc/letsencrypt/live/sub.domain.com. How do I accomplish that?
