Boulder recently merged code to allow for ACME draft-03 style account deactivation.
The process is extremely simple, to deactivate their account a user must POST a signed payload containing {"status":"deactivated"} to the /acme/reg/{id} endpoint. The server will respond with 200 and the contents of the deactivated registration if successful.
