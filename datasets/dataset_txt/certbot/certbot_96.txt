A log of this is
6_RHEL7 (1).log. We've seen it fail at this spot multiple times but it's not consistently reproducible.
If I'm reading yum's output right, it's not failing to download the packages, it's failing to install them. I believe our RHEL 7 AMI hasn't been updated in a very long time. Maybe simply updating it will solve the problem?
