gnureadline should either be a documented dependency or the test should pass without it.
Modifying the import like in letsencrypt/display/completer.py:
try:
    import readline
except ImportError:
    import letsencrypt.display.dummy_readline as readline
is not enough since test_import_error will still try to load the original readline.
