I got the following error on Mac OS10.11.2:
ImportError: dlopen(/Users/Rasmus/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/_cffi_backend.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/libffi.6.dylib
Referenced from: /Users/Rasmus/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/_cffi_backend.so
Reason: image not found
Solved by installing libffi with homebrew, brew install libffi
Should perhaps be merged in to the mac bootstrap
