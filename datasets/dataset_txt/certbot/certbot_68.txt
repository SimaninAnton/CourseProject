The pywin32 225 release a couple weeks ago fixed the difference we were seeing in the value for FILE_ALL_ACCESS described at mhammond/pywin32#1354.
I don't think this affected our production code, but the change breaks our unit tests when this version is used. To fix this, I think we should remove all special handling of this value and bump our minimum dependency to pywin32>=225.
