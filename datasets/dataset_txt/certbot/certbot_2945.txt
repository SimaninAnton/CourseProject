Hi all, I just got my server up an running with letsencrypt! Piece of cake!
I was surprised to see that certs are only valid for 90 days, but it makes sense that clients have to keep proving who they are. If I understand correctly, nginx and apache can be configured to automatically respond to challenges from letsencrypt via "authenticators?"
My question is, is there already a module for this for Node.js (I didn't find one easily, but sometimes people give npm modules weird names), and if not, what's the process like for interacting with let's encrypt to establish/update the cert in use?
I'm not sure that node.js's https module is meant to have the server's certs reloaded on the fly, but idk.
