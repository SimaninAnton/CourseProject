We've been talking about having a separate tool to do specialized things to existing certs (primarily as opposed to obtaining new ones or simply renewing existing ones). Many of these tasks are along the lines of "renewal but with significant changes in cert content", and may also involve editing the renewal database in weird ways. The tasks that might belong there include
splitting cert lineages (obtaining multiple successor certs in separate lineages with overlapping coverage)
merging cert lineages (obtaining a single successor cert with the union of the subjects of the original certs)
rekeying a cert (obtaining a single successor cert with a different subject public key)
adding or subtracting subject DNS names (obtaining a single successor cert with more or fewer or different subject names)
revoking a cert
exporting a cert from Let's Encrypt's database (for use on another machine, for example)
importing a cert into Let's Encrypt's database (that was originally obtained on another machine, or in a way that didn't result in enrolling it in the database)
attempting to securely delete key material
