My operating system is (include version):
Slackware 14.2
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
SlackBuild Script (https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/system/letsencrypt/)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
Failed to find executable apache2ctl in PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system. However, it can still get a certificate for you. Please run "certbot certonly" to do so. You'll need to manually configure your web server to use the resulting certificate.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
0.19.0 works fine, but when i tested 0.20.0, it couldn't find apache2ctl.
We use apachectl in Slackware. Is it possible to add apachectl in the check list ?
It's almost the same report as #4282
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
