I successfully created a multi domain SAN SSL with webroot authentication at https://community.centminmod.com/posts/20018/ for le8.http2ssl.xyz and le9.http2ssl.xyz domains.
However, the only resulting live directory created is for /etc/letsencrypt/live/le8.http2ssl.xyz. If folks are automating the process, they are likely to anchor a variable to domain name so I would be looking for both
/etc/letsencrypt/live/le8.http2ssl.xyz
/etc/letsencrypt/live/le9.http2ssl.xyz - however this is missing
Suggestion
The suggestion is to create a symlink for other SAN domain name folders so /etc/letsencrypt/live/le9.http2ssl.xyz points to /etc/letsencrypt/live/le8.http2ssl.xyz
So for automation, folks can still anchor the variable for domain name to respective domain's vhost files
i.e.
vhostname=le8.http2ssl.xyz
vhostname=le9.http2ssl.xyz
So can do stuff like
ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/${vhostname}/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/${vhostname}/privkey.pem;
