Per letsencrypt/boulder#482, the client integration test uses the boulder monolithic binary (start.sh). Instead it should use start.py, which runs the VA, SA, RA, CA, and WFE as separate processes and requires AMQP to talk between them. This is more consistent with the production environment and will help find bugs in the RPC code.
