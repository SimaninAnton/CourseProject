Currently for instance if you do certbot --help revoke you get:
usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert. 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        path to config file (default: /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
                        and ~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini)

revoke:
  Options for revocation of certs

  --cert-path CERT_PATH
                        Path to where cert is saved (with auth --csr),
                        installed from or revoked. (default: None)
  --key-path KEY_PATH   Path to private key for cert installation or
                        revocation (if account key is missing) (default: None)
The bottom of that output is good, but the top could be better. We'd list a usage string like:
certbot revoke --cert-path CERT_PATH [--key-path KEY_PATH]
And a summary that was relevant.
We'd probably want to do this with a lookup table of usage headers.
