My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
apt-get install certbot
(now running: 0.12.0-1+certbot~xenial+5)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www-cultrix/ -d cultrix.nl -d www.cultrix.nl --must-staple --rsa-key-size 4096 --staging
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: www.cultrix.nl
   Type:   connection
   Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for www.cultrix.nl

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
   your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
   firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
   client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
   that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
[not relevant - errors seems self-explanatory enough]
