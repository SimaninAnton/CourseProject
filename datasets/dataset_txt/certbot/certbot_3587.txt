I'd like to suggest that we move the debian directory to its own repository and that we only keep the contents of that directory in there.
This will remove the need to merge from master and allow us to keep more than one version of the packaging (e.g. one for jessie, one for sid, one for a particular ubuntu release, etc.) as needed. Also, it will keep all of the packaging-specific PRs and issues (which I mostly avoid filing to reduce the noise on the client issue tracker) into a separate place.
How about https://github.com/letsencrypt/debian?
