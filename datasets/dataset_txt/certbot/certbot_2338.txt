In cli.py at line 363 we say
https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/letsencrypt/cli.py#L363
"--expand (or, in some cases, --duplicate)".
These two options have opposite behaviors with respect to controlling the creation of new lineages. What are the "some cases" in which --duplicate would be appropriate to "expand and replace th[e] existing certificate with the new certificate"? Could we remove the parenthesis there? I think it's even leading people astray to try --duplicate when it's not useful to them at all.
