Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
_acme-challenge.domain.com with the following value:
-q8shkQajDXfUQGfUywK10EEATA74xO9bzSo0DPyny4
Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.
(This must be set up in addition to the previous challenges; do not remove,
replace, or undo the previous challenge tasks yet. Note that you might be
asked to create multiple distinct TXT records with the same name. This is
permitted by DNS standards.)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
The following errors were reported by the server:
Domain: domain.com
Type: unauthorized
