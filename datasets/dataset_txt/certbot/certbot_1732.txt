Given the systematic renaming of this client from letsencrypt to certbot some while ago, I was surprised to receive this output:
$ certbot-auto --version
letsencrypt 0.9.3
I.e. the software still refers to itself as letsencrypt instead of certbot.
In case it is not desired (which I think so), I am letting you know.
