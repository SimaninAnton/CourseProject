My operating system is (include version): Amazon AMI
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
ran this command sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --nginx
and it produced
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/letsencrypt:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because: it did not work like they said it would from this website https://certbot.eff.org/#centos6-nginx
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
No logs for me:
tail -500 /var/log/letsencrypt
tail: cannot open ‘/var/log/letsencrypt’ for reading: No such file or directory
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
