As part of getting distros to package more of our plugins, we've agreed to stop releasing all of our packages in lockstep. This means that instead of requiring that all of our packages have the same version number, people are able to mix and match versions. The benefit of this is distros (and us) don't have to repackage everything anytime we change a single package.
To do this, we need to:
Modify each setup.py to depend on the oldest version of its Certbot dependencies that is needed to work. Some digging needs to be done to figure out what this version is.
Set up tests in Travis to ensure the minimum versions required stays accurate. This can be a mix and match between the test-everything branch depending on what makes the most sense.
