This is a piece of #5775 that would be nice to have for 1.0. An important thing to test here is that MANIFEST.in is updated so the tests are still included in the built package and run with python setup.py test.
There is a lot of individual pieces of this such as acme, certbot-apache, certbot-nginx, and certbot-dns-* that should probably be split into separate PRs (and could even be worked on by separate people).
