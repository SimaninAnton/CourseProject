My operating system is (include version):
N/A
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Ran the client in developer mode from my local tree
I ran this command and it produced this output:
$ certbot --help dns-cloudflare
usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate. 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        path to config file (default: /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
                        and ~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini)

dns-cloudflare:
  Obtain certificates using a DNS TXT record (if you are using Cloudflare
  for DNS).

  --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds DNS_CLOUDFLARE_PROPAGATION_SECONDS
                        The number of seconds to wait for DNS to propagate
                        before asking the ACME server to verify the DNS
                        record. (default: 10)
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials DNS_CLOUDFLARE_CREDENTIALS
                        Cloudflare credentials INI file. (default: None)
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The help output does not include any information about the contents of the credentials INI file, such as what is included in the generated documentation or interactive prompts.
I would expect it to include at least the names of the keys which must be included in the INI file (i.e., dns_cloudflare_email and dns_cloudflare_api_key).
The lack of this information makes the plugin difficult to use, even by users who are familiar with it, without the aid of other documentation.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
