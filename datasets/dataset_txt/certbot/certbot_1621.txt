Certbot appears to be attempting to execute "" (empty string) on my local machine when trying to install and test. Notably, it works when installed from the fedora package, but not when installed from pip.
Environment:
Fully updated Fedora 24
Virtualenv w/Python 2.7
Installed from pip (pip install certbot)
When running certbot, I got the following error:
(venv) [root@levitra ~]# certbot
An unexpected error occurred:
Executable not found: can't find the executable for the dialog-like programPlease see the logfile 'certbot.log' for more details.
(venv) [root@levitra ~]# cat certbot.log
Traceback (most recent call last):

As I said, it appears to be attempting to execute or find a program called '' (empty string) locally.
