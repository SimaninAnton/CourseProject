My operating system is (include version):
CentOS release 6.8 (Final)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
[root@kizbit ~]# scl enable python27 "/root/certbot-auto renew"
/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:26: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python. A future version of cryptography will drop support for Python 2.6
  DeprecationWarning
It still uses Python 2.6 and still produces a warning. I also tried:
[root@kizbit ~]# scl enable python27 "python /root/certbot-auto renew"
  File "/root/certbot-auto", line 18
    if [ -z "$XDG_DATA_HOME" ]; then
                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
[root@kizbit ~]# scl enable python27 "python --version"
Python 2.7.8
WITH 2.6 IT WORKS BUT GIVES DEPRECATION:
[root@kizbit ~]# /root/certbot-auto renew
/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:26: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python. A future version of cryptography will drop support for Python 2.6
  DeprecationWarning
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected it to run without warnings.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
