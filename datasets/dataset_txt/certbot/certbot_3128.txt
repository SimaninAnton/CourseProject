i am runnin apache2 on debian and i cant get letsencrypt to install i keep getting the errror:
The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
the error was: PluginError('Unable to parse runtime variables',)
they dont recommend installing the missing lib(ConfigArgParse) with python but after getting this error i tried anyways and got it to work with my version of python (2.7.3)
Python 2.7.3 (default, Mar 13 2014, 11:03:55)
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2

import configargparse
exit()
