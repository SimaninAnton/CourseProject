Continuing the work of #3193, we should update the pinned versions of our packages for certbot-auto. As of writing this, they haven't been updated in ~6 months and may include patches we want to push to our users. When doing this, we need to be careful to avoid any unwanted deprecations/regressions in our dependencies.
