I tried creating a symbolic link to letsencrypt-auto in ~/.local/bin/, but get an error message when I run it:
Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/danboulet/.local/bin/py26reqs.txt'
Looks like the script doesnâ€™t follow symlinks when searching for other files within its own directory.
