The config generated by letsencrypt contains these stanzas:
# allow all
       Order allow,deny
       allow from all

# deny all
      Order allow,deny
      Deny from all
These are not valid when running Apache 2.4. Instead they need to be:
# allow all 
      Require all granted    

# deny all
      Require all denied
