My operating system is (include version):
CentOS 7
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager (yum)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
I followed the instructions here to add a new domain name to my certificate. To add my new subdomain ("b.example.com"), I ran:
sudo certbot certonly --cert-name a.example.com -d b.example.com
I was then prompted to pick between webroot and standalone:
How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
2: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): c
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expect Certbot to re-use the default method, like it does when certbot renew is run.
Not a huge issue since modifying existing certificates isn't done that often, but it would improve usability since I don't remember which option I had used when creating my certificate the first time several months ago.
