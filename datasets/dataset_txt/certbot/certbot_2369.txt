While attempting to run on Amazon Linux: Linux ip #1 SMP Sat Oct 24 01:31:37 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Git commit hash: 6950dbd0708d3ba16b717ad1097332fc37e33f15
I get the following error:
[ec2-user@ip letsencrypt]$ ./letsencrypt-auto

This was working as of Feb 8th... however when trying to checkout an old version to find where things broke, letsencrypt-auto keeps re-upgrading itself to the latest version!
