Hi,
Thanks for your initiative it looks amathing!
Just a quick question, I was wondering if it will be possible to get a certificate for a particular subdomain?
For example mysubdomain.mydnsprovider.org
(With different SSL key for different subdomains)
I.e Will it be possible to do
"lets-encrypt my.example.com"
Actually I am author of Own-Mailbox (see Own-Mailbox.com), I will offer free subdomain to users, they will all have a different SSL key, and I am looking for a way to let them have a free SSL certificate recognized by the browser.
Thanks in advence,
Keep up the great job!
Pierre.
