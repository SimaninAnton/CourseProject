Seems like a sensible solution to #2697 and similar without compromising security would be to allow discovery of the port via DNS SRV record. Letsencrypt could query a record like
_letsencrypt._tcp IN SRV 0 0 8080 10.10.10.10
on the domain and forward verification requests to the resulting address/port combination. This has the same benefits as DNS verification but without the drawback of requiring dynamic updates.
This would also mean users could easily centralise the management of their certificates if they wish, by referencing a central cert server.
