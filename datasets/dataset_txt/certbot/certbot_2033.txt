I have two hostnames with very similar configurations. Both are hosted on the same nameservers, both have a CNAME to a Heroku hostname. Which then, itself, resolves to a second CNAME before finally an A is found.
The first, www.toicon.com worked as expected.
The second, inside.theartificial.nl complains:
DNS problem: networking error looking up A
Is there something magic about www hostnames that make CNAME acceptable, or is my simple domain somehow misconfigured?
