I thought this would be a Python 3.6 Issue however it happens in 2.7 as well
My operating system is (include version):
Windows Server 2012 R2 Python 3.6
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
pip install certbot==0.13.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot certificates
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I would expect cetbot to list the certificates
I have fixed by commenting out a line in the util section
configargparse.ACTION_TYPES_THAT_DONT_NEED_A_VALUE.add(ShowWarning)
Before Fix (Python 3.6)
Before Fix (Python 2.7)
Fix (Both 3.6 and 2.7):
After Fix (Python 3.6)
After Fix (Python 2.7):
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
File "c:\certbot-test\lib\site-packages\certbot\util.py", line 440, in add_deprecated_argument
