If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
Debian stretch/sid
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto certificates --cert-name buypasstest1
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Invalid signature on OCSP response for /etc/letsencrypt/live/buypasstest1/cert.pem
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The OCSP response is correctly signed, not by the issuer itself but by a properly designated responder.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.
