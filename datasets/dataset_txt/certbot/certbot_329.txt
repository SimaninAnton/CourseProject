My operating system is (include version):
Docker - Scratch/Alpine
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
I have Docker Image certbot/certbot:latest.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot-auto certonly -d mydomain.com -n --preferred-challenges dns --manual-auth-hook /etc/scripts/manual-dns-auth.sh --agree-tos -m admin@mydomain.com --manual --manual-public-ip-logging-ok --server http://traefik.boulder.com:4001/directory
I received the certificates as expected:
fullchain.pem
chain.pem
cert.pem
privkey.pem
When i installed the same in an alpine/scratch image, and tried to make a call to the https service, the error i received was
TLS handshake error from 10.5.0.16:34980: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority
Need to know how can i make the certificate authority trusted by the server as well as client
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The certificates installed were not trusted by the server/client. Expected was that the certificate authority would be trusted or at least Root CA certificate would be available...
