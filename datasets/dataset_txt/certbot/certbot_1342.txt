In some scenarios it would be desirable not to save unencrypted private keys on disk, for instance when they reside on untrusted locations (like VPSes without disk encryption support), and securing communications may be a concern.
For now I'm using a script than encrypts the saved key and deletes the original one, but I think a native solution would be preferable, also to avoid saving (even temporarily) plain keys on disk.
I also understand that automation is one of the main goals of LE, but considering than many servers allow for the key's password to be entered on startup (Apache is for instance one of them), such an option may be implemented as an optional switch that have to be explicitly activated when needed.
