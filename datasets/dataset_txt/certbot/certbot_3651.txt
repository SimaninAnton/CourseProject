As currently structured this project has dependencies on both PyCrypto and M2Crypto. This doesn't seem ideal, especially as the latter is essentially a moribund project with no active path towards py3 compatibility. Is there a plan to move to just one?
Full disclosure: This came to my attention because I work on pyca/cryptography, which is the underlying dependency for pyOpenSSL and the future of PyCrypto. pyca/cryptography itself currently would not fit your needs as our X509 support is incomplete (as is our serialization of asymmetric keys), but we're working on it.
