Hi,
first, thanks for this awesome tool that helps the web moving to the right direction.
As many other users, I am stuck because of the certificate limit rate. On my website example.com users can generate their own platform myplatform.example.com
To activate https on the fly, I have to create a new certificate, which makes me reach the limit in no time.
I'm using this command :
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --agree-tos --email 'xxx@example.com' --webroot --webroot-path "/data/www-env/myplatform/public/" -d "myplatform.example.com" --debug
If I could add to an existing certificate the subdomain, it would be clearly a better option than this.
Any possibility to have this feature implemented? (Or a premium option for unlimited certificate issuance would also be a good solution).
Thanks for your amazing work,
Michael
