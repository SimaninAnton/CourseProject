hello,
I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 and I installed certbot (letsencrypt) using the following command:
$ pip install --user letsencrypt-apache
This installs letsencrypt, certbot, and all missing dependencies to my ~/.local directory. Anything I install via pip goes in ~/.local. This keeps my pip installs separate from my apt installs.
However, when I try to run it I get the following error:
$ letsencrypt --apache
An unexpected error occurred:
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt'
Please see the logfile 'certbot.log' for more details.
But this error only displays the first time I run it. Subsequent runs give the following error:
$ letsencrypt --apache
Access denied writing to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log. To run as non-root, set --logs-dir, --config-dir, --work-dir to writable paths.
Ok, fine, but where are --logs-dir, --config-dir, and --work-dir defined? Inside a config file would be my first guess, but where is the default config file? Also, I couldn't find any of the above --xxxx-dir options mentioned anywhere in the --help.
What am I missing?
Thanks in advance,
-Will
