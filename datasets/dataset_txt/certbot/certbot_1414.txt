It should not successfully return a certificate without its chain. We can do this by retrying acme.fetch_chain once, then telling the user to rerun with the path to where we saved the cert after fixing the network.
This is bad because if we only tell users about the cert, they won't know to also get the chain and concat the files to make the fullchain, and they'll accidentally use the cert file, which causes that weird failure mode in modern browsers.
