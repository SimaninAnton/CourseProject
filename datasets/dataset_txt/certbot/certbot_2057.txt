Hello,
Is it possible to create a certificate without common name? Or set a fee text as common name?
I have many domains listed as subject alternative names. If the common name has to be a domain, it looks very confusing to users, as the common name is often displayed first when the user checks the certificate details.
How can I keep the common name empty?
Best Regards,
Stefan
