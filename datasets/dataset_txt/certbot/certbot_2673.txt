Hello,
It seems that letsencrypt-auto update himself to the latest release of source files.
Is there a way to use letsencrypt-auto without automatic update to the latest version?
If not, it will be great to have an option like --release with values release name found on https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/releases and default auto.
Thanks,
Arnaud
