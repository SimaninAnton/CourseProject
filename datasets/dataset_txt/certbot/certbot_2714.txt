Hello there,
I have a domain name which, with tld is 66 characters long. It is 62 characters long excluding the .com
I have obtained certificates successfully for other domains, but trying to obtain a certificate for the long one fails with:
An unexpected error occurred:
Error: [('asn1 encoding routines', 'ASN1_mbstring_ncopy', 'string too long')]
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.
Please support longer domain names.
