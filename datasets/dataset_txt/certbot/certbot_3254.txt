This is a feature request not bug
When using the manual mode in scripts, it would be nice if it could be run as two separate invocation instead of pausing in the middle and asking the user to hit enter after the challenge field was installed.
I'm thinking of something like "authgen" does first half, and has a CLI to put the out put challenge in a given file, then you run the client a second time with something like "authcheck"
The current CLI is pretty hard to automate.
