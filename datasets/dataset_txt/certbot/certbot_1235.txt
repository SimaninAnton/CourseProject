We should reach out to our OS package maintainers and try to get them on a mailing list so we can easily send messages with them. Currently, only our Debian, Fedora/EPEL, and Ubuntu PPA package maintainers are on our certbot-dev mailing list. We can either ask others to join certbot-dev, make a certbot-packaging list, or a certbot-announce list.
