4d6a1ee introduced a change which causes the domain order passed to the client not to be preserved.
The previous implementation in get_authorizations would iterate over the original domain list, preserving the original order, whereas the new implementation uses authzr.values(), which does not follow the same sorting order.
As a side-effect, the Common Name field is not guaranteed to be the first domain passed via -d, causing issues for users who are relying on this after upgrading to 0.5.0.
