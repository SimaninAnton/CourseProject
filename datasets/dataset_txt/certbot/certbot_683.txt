I'm packaging certbot for Gentoo and noticed an anomaly between the different setup.py updates.
Compare
certbot/certbot-apache/setup.py
Line 12 in cc344bf
 'acme>=0.21.1', 
and
certbot/setup.py
Line 39 in cc344bf
 'acme>0.21.1', 
I'm not sure setup.py for certbot should have acme>0.21.1, but should probably be acme>=0.21.1 as is defined by the plugins.
