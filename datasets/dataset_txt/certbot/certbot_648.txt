My operating system is Arch Linux
I installed Certbot with OS package manager
Currently, there are several DNS authenticators available. One example is the Digital Ocean dns authenticator that supports authentication using the Digital Ocean API. Linode is another VPS host that also has an API that support DNS record manipulation.
An authenticator for Linode would be greatly appreciated!
