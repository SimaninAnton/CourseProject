Related to #5859, the boulder team recommended that we set up duplicates of our integration tests using boulder's test/config-next in the test-everything branch. This benefits both teams so we know when planned changes to boulder aren't compatible with Certbot but alerts us to this issue in a way that doesn't slow down development.
Ideally we should create duplicates like this for every one of our integration tests, but I think it's important to make sure we have at least one test like this with ACMEv1, ACMEv2, and for both ACME versions with our "oldest" tests.
