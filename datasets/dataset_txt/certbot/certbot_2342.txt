A unicode error is biting a lot of people who have the several-year-old pip 1.5.4. It's likely a bug in that version of pip and, slightly less likely, in an old version of setuptools. Since pip 8 is now out, let's replace peep with it (via embedding pipstrap), gain a more maintained installer, and dodge these bugs all in one fell swoop. Pipstrap installs a modern pip and setuptools, so we're covered either way.
