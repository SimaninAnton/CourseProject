I would like to request a certificate using a CSR for which I have minimal control over the generation. This CSR is generated without Subject Alternative Name and there is no way to force it. I don't have access to the private key to create a CSR myself either.
It would be great to have a way to specify SANs along with the CSR so that they are integrated in the certificate during the signing process.
