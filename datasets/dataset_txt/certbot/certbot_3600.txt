Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x64 seems to be having trouble pulling the display together correctly. But the application certainly hums along smoothly.
Ubuntu 14.10 x64 has no problems with displaying the dialog. This is mostly to prove I don't have a broken terminal somehow. (which could still be true, frankly.)
