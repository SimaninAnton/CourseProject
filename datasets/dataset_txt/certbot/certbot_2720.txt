IPv4 addresses are running out, so NATting is very common.
I have a server that listens only on port 443, port 80 is used by a different server.
When I try to use letsencrypt-auto it tries to verify the server via port 80 which obviously would not work.
There should be an option that the letsencrypt-auto tool not only tries
http:///.well-known/acme-challenge/
it should also try
https:///.well-known/acme-challenge/
It might be, that this is somehow possible with a parameter but I could not find it.
Keep in mind, that one might maybe upgrade his site from self-signed to a letsencrypt certificate but has only port 443 opened.
