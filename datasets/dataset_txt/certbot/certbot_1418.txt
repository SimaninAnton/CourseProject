What actually happened
Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?
1: staging.fendamenda.com.au
certbot didn't understand the sites which used <Virtualhost> ... </Virtualhost> although Apache accepted them fine. When capitalising the h and using <VirtualHost> ... <VirtualHost> it worked and picked up the other site configs.
I've posted an example virtualhost entry and basic info at http://www.kublermdk.com/2017/02/08/letsencrypt-certbot-virtualhost-vs-virtualhost/
