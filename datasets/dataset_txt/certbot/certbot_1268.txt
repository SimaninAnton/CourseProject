My operating system is (include version):
Gentoo profile 13.0
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
emerge app-crypt/certbot-9999 (= latest git master commit)
I ran this command and it produced this output:
First, I ran certbot with must-staple = True in cli.ini (by setting --must-staple` on the CLI).
After that, I wanted to remove the Must Staple feature, so I explicitely set the value to False. This is the result:
server ~ # certbot -vv renew --force-renewal --staging --cert-name example.com
usage:
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert.
certbot: error: must-staple is a flag but is being set to 'False'
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
I expected certbot to run, but now without the must-staple option set to true.
IMO it is strange that setting the variable to True is possible, but False generates an error.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
There's no log generated. The above is all certbot is outputting, even with -vv.
