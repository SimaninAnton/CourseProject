The Apache plugin has begun sporadically failing unit tests in Travis. I have only seen this occur during coverage tests. Here's 3 different logs of the problem: log1, log2, log3.
These problems need to be fixed as it slows down development, confuses new contributors, and may be caused by larger problems with the plugin.
