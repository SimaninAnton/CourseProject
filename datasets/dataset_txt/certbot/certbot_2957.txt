Why is sudo required when I run ./letsencrypt-auto --help --debug (OS X)?
As far as I can tell, all the dependencies are installed before this step.
The dependencies are installed using Homebrew, so everything is owned by the local user.
I only need want the --help output.
This is the last line before asking for the password:
Running with virtualenv: sudo /Users/ruben/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt --help --debug
The full output I get when running the command is:
./letsencrypt-auto --help --debug
grep: /etc/os-release: No such file or directory

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

OS X already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include
