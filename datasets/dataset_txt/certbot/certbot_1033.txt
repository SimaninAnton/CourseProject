As suggested by @schoen, it'd be useful if Certbot included the plugin it was using at the INFO logging level so it was printed to the terminal. This would often help with debugging problems when the user provides only Certbot's output and not it's logfile(s).
We should do this for all major subcommands including certonly, run, and renew.
