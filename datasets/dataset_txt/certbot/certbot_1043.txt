My operating system is: UBUNTU 16 LTS (xenial)
certbot --version = 0.14.2
I installed Certbot with:
Standard apt install instructions.
I ran this command and it produced this output:
... after apt update and general upgrade... used sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
Reading package lists... Done

python-certbot-nginx is already the newest version (0.14.2-1+certbot+16.041).
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  libssl1.0.2 linux-headers-4.4.0-78 linux-headers-4.4.0-78-generic linux-headers-4.4.0-79 linux-headers-4.4.0-79-generic
  linux-headers-4.4.0-81 linux-headers-4.4.0-81-generic linux-image-4.4.0-78-generic linux-image-4.4.0-79-generic
  linux-image-4.4.0-81-generic php7.0-cli php7.0-fpm php7.0-json php7.0-opcache php7.0-readline zlib1g-dev
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Need version 0.16! not 0.14.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
stay certbot --version = 0.14.2
