The addition as by is making incompatible python-acme 0.4.1 with any ubuntu/debian distribution that is still offering it as official package.
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/adding-random-entries-to-the-directory/33417
this include making impossible to use python-acme on ubuntu-trusty, ubuntu-xenial, debian-jessie, debian-stretch that are the long term support platforms fro Ubuntu and Debian.
This ticket is to propose to produce a patch to make python-acme compatible with 'adding-random-entries-to-the-directory' addition to lets'encrypt spec.
