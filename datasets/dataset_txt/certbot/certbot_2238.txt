I'm running this for the first time and am receiving errors when entering my gmail.com email address. For one of them containing a . it would just error out and suggest to use --register-unsafely-without-email. I tried with another gmail account without a . and it brought me to the TOS agreement page but then was given another error.
Logs give:
The provided email for a registration was invalid :: DNS problem: query timed out looking up MX for gmail.com

I am open to suggestions. Currently on a DigitalOcean server running Ubuntu 14.04 for nginx.
