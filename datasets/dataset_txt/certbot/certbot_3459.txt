There currently isn't any output that provides reasonable detail about the underlying process.
-v is the closest, but it suffers from informing the user about every single HTTPS connection and could use some general cleanup.
It would be nice to have a mode that was similar to the display seen in the Ncurses demo. https://youtu.be/Gas_sSB-5SU?t=51
