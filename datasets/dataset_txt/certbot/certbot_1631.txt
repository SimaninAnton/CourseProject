Hi everyone, I just installed certbot! Fantastic.
It works correctly with apache.
https: // myvps / website /
I have a question, if I want to use it for a node.js server is possible?
i.e. https: // myvpsdomain: 9001
I am not sure if i can do something like that, what do you think?
I tried to change the ports of the node server from 9001 to 80/443, of course disabling apache.
But maybe, my reasoning is wrong, the certification does not work without apache, right?
