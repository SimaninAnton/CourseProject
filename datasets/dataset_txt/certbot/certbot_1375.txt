My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.5 LTS
My web server is (include version):
nginx (but not relevant, I've been using the standalone here.
How did you install Certbot:
using pip3 install letsencrypt.
What command did you run and what output did it produce?
% certbot certonly --standalone -d example.org -d […]

Can you provide a Certbot error log showing the issue?
It is stored by default in /var/log/letsencrypt - feel free to redact domain names, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit

TypeError: must be str, not bytes
Workaround to make it work
in the /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/certbot/storage.py file I added the following function at module scope:
ensure_str = lambda s: s if isinstance(s, str) else s.decode('utf8')
and used it at the end to make sure str were being written to the files:
1062         else:
1063             with open(target["privkey"], "w") as f:
1064                 logger.debug("Writing new private key to %s.", target["privkey"])
1065                 f.write(ensure_str(new_privkey))
1066                                                                                                                                                                                                     1067         # Save everything else
1068         with open(target["cert"], "w") as f:
1069             logger.debug("Writing certificate to %s.", target["cert"])
1070             f.write(ensure_str(new_cert))
1071         with open(target["chain"], "w") as f:
1072             logger.debug("Writing chain to %s.", target["chain"])
1073             f.write(ensure_str(new_chain))
1074         with open(target["fullchain"], "w") as f:
1075             logger.debug("Writing full chain to %s.", target["fullchain"])
1076             f.write(ensure_str(new_cert) + ensure_str(new_chain))
That solution is pretty dirty, but it works.
