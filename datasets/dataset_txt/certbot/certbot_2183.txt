I created certificates for several of my domains and noticed that letsencrypt left behind an empty .well-known directory in my webroot. This happens because it uses os.makedirs to create {root_path}/URI_ROOT_PATH, with URI_ROOT_PATH being .well-known/acme-challenges. When it cleans up, it removes the single directory root_path/URI_ROOT_PATH, but it doesn't remove each level of the URI_ROOT_PATH it created.
I attempted a patch here which "steps up" each level of URI_ROOT_PATH and attempts to delete them: https://github.com/othatbrian/letsencrypt/commit/74dd1fc7d502d1a1de3881e7be0bd13df9b3c86f
but I haven't set up a test environment to attempt to test that particular fix.
