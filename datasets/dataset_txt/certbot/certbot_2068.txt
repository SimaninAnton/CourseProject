The certbot-auto (letsencrypt-auto) script leaves behind a temporary directory every time it runs. This looks like a regression as of release v0.5.0 (commit 4d4cfb4) which removes the trap "rm -rf '$TEMP_DIR'" EXIT statement.
Assuming removing the trap was intentional (it may not have been; I can't find an issue or commit that refers specifically to that change, and it also temporarily disappeared in the "bad" pip8 branch merge), here's where the problem is:
if [ "$NO_SELF_UPGRADE" != 1 ]; then
  echo "Checking for new version..."
  TEMP_DIR=$(TempDir)

  ...

  if ! REMOTE_VERSION=`"$LE_PYTHON" "$TEMP_DIR/fetch.py" --latest-version` ; then
    echo "WARNING: unable to check for updates."
  elif [ "$LE_AUTO_VERSION" != "$REMOTE_VERSION" ]; then

    ...

    # TODO: Clean up temp dir safely, even if it has quotes in its path.
    rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
  fi  # A newer version is available.

  >>>$TEMP_DIR cleanup should be here instead<<<
fi  # Self-upgrading is allowed.
