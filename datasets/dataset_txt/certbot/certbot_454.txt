Hi guys,
I was trying to install certbot and an error showed up.
My operating system is Centos 7:
I installed Certbot via comand line
I ran the following command lines:
$ yum -y install yum-utils
$ yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-extras rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional
$ sudo yum install python2-certbot-apache
Below is the error I received:
Error: Package: python2-certbot-apache-0.25.1-1.el7.noarch (epel)
Requires: mod_ssl
You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest
Your advise will be highly appreciated.
