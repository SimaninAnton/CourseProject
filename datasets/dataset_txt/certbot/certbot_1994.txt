Hey.
I tried accessing the website to get a quick snippet of commands to run. I looked at https://certbot.eff.org/.
When I tried to pick a OS nothing happened, I didn't see any list of snippets coming up. I checked the console and saw the error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null.
Thought I should let you know.
