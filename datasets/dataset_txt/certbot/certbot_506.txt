My operating system is (include version):
debian 8
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot
I ran this command and it produced this output:
./certbot-auto certonly --standalone --rsa-key-size 4096 -d mydomain.de
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
