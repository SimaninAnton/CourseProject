The current revision of the ACME spec only allows dvsni on 443; however, Nginx and Standalone (#479) allow user-specified ports for dvsni validation.
Apparently this is a contentious issue (letsencrypt/acme-spec#33). I would prefer to restrict dvsni to port 443 for launch unless there is a compelling reason not to.
