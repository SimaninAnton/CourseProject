If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version): SSH
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc): centos7.0
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo yum install git
sudo git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot /opt/letsencrypt
cd /opt/letsencrypt
./certbot-auto certonly –standalone –email 2897xxx@qq.com -d www.example.com -d example.com
with right email of Gmail, and right domain name.
But reply with the following
usage:
certbot-auto [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...
Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates. By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate.
certbot: error: unrecognized arguments: –standalone –email ******@gmail.com
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because: there is no reason that my email unrecognized, and then installing stop. I can't find out the reason and want to solve this problem.
Sincerely waiting for news on that, thanks a lot ahead of time.
