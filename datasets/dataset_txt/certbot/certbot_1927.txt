Hi fellow engineers,
I'm currently having an issue regarding renew certificate for proxy enabled domain, I use Cloudflare for all of my domains, the only way to do this is that I have to disable proxy on Cloudflare and run the command manually
I already scheduled cron for renewal every month, it defeat the purpose since I still need to turn of proxy on Cloudflare and run the command manually
Regards,
Nik Saiful
