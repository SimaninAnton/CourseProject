Checked out master w/ venv to try see how plugins are developed.
Following the instructions here for installing the example plugin, certbot plugins results in:
* certbot-example-plugins:example_authenticator
Description: Example Authenticator plugin
Interfaces: IAuthenticator, IPlugin
Entry point: example_authenticator = certbot_example_plugins:Authenticator

* certbot-example-plugins:example_installer
Description: Example Installer plugin
Interfaces: IInstaller, IPlugin
Entry point: example_installer = certbot_example_plugins:Installer
which means you have to use -a certbot-example-plugins:example_installer, --certbot-example-plugins:example_installer-confoption blah etc.
What I should be able to do is just use -a example_authenticator, right?
This effect also happens against my own plugin which I stick in a directory at the root of the repo.
I can't figure out why this is happening or how to tune setup.py to stop the prefixing from happening like with the plugins that ship with the repo.
Any hints?
Thanks!
