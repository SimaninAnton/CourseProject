Certbot renew command (using the nginx plugin)
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
produces this error:
nginx: [error] open() "/run/nginx.pid" failed
Resulting in spawning a rogue nginx process which needs to be killed manually and nginx needs to be started manually service nginx start
It looks like it runs the prehook from the configs in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal which stops nginx but still expects to read /run/nginx.pid
nginx version: nginx/1.14.0
ubuntu 16.04
certbot 0.26.1
