If acme doesn't have a nonce stored, it does a HEAD to the same resource it's about to POST to, to get a nonce. This works as long as the server responds with a nonce on that resource, but it is not required to according to the spec. A HEAD will (often) return an error, and the spec says:
...and SHOULD provide it in error responses as well.
Should the acme client relay on a SHOULD? According to the spec, clients should use the newNonce url to get fresh nonces.
