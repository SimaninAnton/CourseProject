When using letsencrypt-auto, the generated apache vhost file is created correctly but the location of the certs is not specified in the file :
i.e.
SSLCertificateFile insert_cert_file_path
SSLCertificateKeyFile insert_key_file_path
It looks like this is quite intentional in the code but im not sure why (https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/letsencrypt-apache/letsencrypt_apache/configurator.py#L579)
Furthermore just specifying the cert and key doesn't appear to be enough (I got browser security errors with this setup). Using the SSLCertificateChainFile directive fixes this :
SLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/cert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem
SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem
