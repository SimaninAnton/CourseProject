Maybe you should recommend a default installation path.
docs/using.rst only says
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
cd letsencrypt
But where should this be run?
IMHO the git repo should be placed in /usr/local/src/letsencrypt
cd /usr/local/src/   
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
cd letsencrypt
and then install to /usr/local/bin
virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python2 /usr/local/
cd /usr/local/bin/
./pip install -r /usr/local/src/letsencrypt/requirements.txt .
Using a default path would it make easier to provide an unattended upgrade tool

As said, that's just my 2 cents
