Debian removed jessie-updates from its mirrors which is causing tests on the AMI at
certbot/tests/letstest/targets.yaml
Line 36 in 3830c0f
 - ami: ami-116d857a 
to fail.
We could update our test scripts to fix up the apt config, but I think ideally we should just find a new Debian 8 AMI that has this problem resolved out of the box.
However we fix this, we should make sure the changes cause all tests we run as the part of the release process to pass on Debian 8 before merging.
