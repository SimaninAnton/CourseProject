sample certbot run here:
# certbot run --apache

Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: foobar.example.com        
[...]
that domain is not actually enabled in my apache configuration: it is not symlinked to the sites-enabled directory:
root@marcos:/etc/letsencrypt# grep -R foobar.example.com /etc/apache2
/etc/apache2/sites-available/ikisite-foobar.example.com:        ServerName foobar.example.com:80
therefore it should not be detected by the apache plugin.
this is similar to #2949, except that one was treated as a problem parsing files with commas, whereas there is the larger problems of disabled configs here.
