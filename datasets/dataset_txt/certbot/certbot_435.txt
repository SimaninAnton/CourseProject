The security issue fixed in this release doesn't affect us, but we should upgrade anyway. To do this, the cryptography hashes in letsencrypt-auto-source/pieces/dependency-requirements.txt should be updated and letsencrypt-auto rebuilt.
We will also need to silence the deprecation warnings they added about hmac.compare_digest. This should be done using the warnings module.
