In #1661 (comment) @mgedmin said:
Hmm. Dynamically-computed install_requires causes problems for users of pip >= 7.0, which has wheel caching enabled by default: pypa/pip#3025. Short version:
I pip install letsencrypt on Python 2.7, pip runs setup.py and builds a wheel (marked -py2-none-any.whl) and puts it in ~/.cache/pip/
I pip install letsencrypt on Python 2.6, pip discovers a valid wheel and installs it, using install_requires computed earlier for a different Python version."
