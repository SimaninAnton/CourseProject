My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-125-generic x86_64)
I run WordPress website on AWS with it
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Installed using the following commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache
It produced this output:
Starting web server apache2 AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified doma in name, using 127.0.0.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress th is message
(98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:8 0

no listening sockets available, shutting down
AH00015: Unable to open logs
Action 'start' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
See attached above
Any help guys would be massively appreciated as my website is down now :( Massive thanks in advance!
