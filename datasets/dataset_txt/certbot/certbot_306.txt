I've heard about two reports of the Apache plugin thinking it obtained and installed a certificate for Apache on CentOS 6, but when the user visits their domain, Apache's self signed certificate is served. This is a pretty serious problem and should be fixed.
The one report I've seen myself is at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/connection-not-secure-on-centos-6/80054. @schoen has seen more.
We're thinking this probably has something to do with vhost precedence rules, especially on CentOS 6 where if I remember correctly, NameVirtualHost is disabled by default.
We should definitely try and get a configuration that reproduces this problem as it will make debugging much easier.
