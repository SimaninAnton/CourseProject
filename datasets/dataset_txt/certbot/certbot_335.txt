Another side effect of rewriting most of our bash scripts into Python is we no longer get the output from shell commands run by the script. For example, we no longer see the output from pip. I hit this when the pip install step was failing for me but I couldn't see why because it was never output by the script.
I personally think we should change this and print the command output in all/most cases. I think this should be done whether the command was successful or not. This is unfortunately more complicated to do with Python's subprocess module than in a shell script, but it's certainly doable.
If we wanted to get fancy, we could print the output of commands while they're executing. This is kind of nice for long running commands such as using pip to install all of our packages and dependencies. With that said, I think just waiting for the command to exit before printing anything is easier to implement and is totally fine.
