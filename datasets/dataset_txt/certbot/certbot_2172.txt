The obvious way a CA can become corrupt is if they disclose the signing key to 3rd parties, in any way, shape or form.
So what exactly stops Let's Encrypt from such scenarios like:
disclosing the key to the feds
selling the key on darknet/.onion
The reason I ask is because this is a very tempting opportunity to get SSL certificates for gratis, but how can I be sure that if I don't pay for a product, am I and my traffic not the product itself?
