In my /var/log/letsencrypt/ I have over 235 log files (letsencrypt.log.xxx) - so many!
Not sure if letsencrypt does rotate them or if I should configure manual logrotation for them via a weekly crontab or so?
If so, what's the recommended recipe to rotate? Something like this?
/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log {
        su root root
        rotate 4
        missingok
        create 640 root root
        postrotate
                # should i restart some services here? nginx?
        endscript
}
Thanks for any clues. Using v0.11 here on Ubuntu 16.10
