I tried to create an certificat with domain contains german umlauts. Domain is: ent√§.de
I getting in the console this error:
An unexpected error occurred:
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe4' in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)
Please see the logfiles in /var/log/letsencrypt for more details.

Is there a way to fix this?
