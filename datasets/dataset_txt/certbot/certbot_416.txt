My edit solution at #6294 is wrong. the certbot_dns_rfc2136 authenticator is not working properly after all. When if successfully adds the TXT record it does not flush the record to the zone file/ this can be observed by doing a " rndc sync -clean " while waiting ion the TXT record to propagate. /when it goes to clean up the challenge the same occurs - it stops in the jnl file until a rndc sync -clean is done
This is programming issue I cannot configure around and it does not appear any setup will cure
