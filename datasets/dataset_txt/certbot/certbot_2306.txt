In new code intended to fix #2503, I use _set_by_cli as one criterion for deciding to save something in the renewal config file. I found that it sometimes returns True, resulting in saving items, even when I did not actually set those things from the CLI at all. The items in question that I observed so far were these:
apache_enmod = a2enmod
apache_server_root = /etc/apache2
apache_dismod = a2dismod
apache_handle_sites = True
apache_handle_modules = True
standalone_supported_challenges = "tls-sni-01,http-01"
apache_le_vhost_ext = -le-ssl.conf
apache_challenge_location = /etc/apache2
nginx_server_root = /etc/nginx
nginx_ctl = nginx
apache_vhost_root = /etc/apache2/sites-available
There could be others, but these were ones I saw so far.
