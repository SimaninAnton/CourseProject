Steps to reproduce:
Install Apache and Nginx. Run Nginx and leave Apache stopped.
Run letsencrypt --text --agree-eula --agree-tos -d lastbart.at -a apache auth
Actual result:
Failed authorization procedure. lastbart.at (dvsni): connection :: The server could not connect to the client for DV :: Failed to connect to host for DVSNI challenge
Expected result:
Client gives an error saying that Apache doesn't have access to port 443 or isn't listening on port 443.
One can also reproduce with only Apache installed by editing ports.conf so that it doesn't include port 443.
