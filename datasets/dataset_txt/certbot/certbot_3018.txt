I ran the Let's Encrypt script on my Mac and got an error that has me a bit worried about continuing.
$ ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server \
â†’       https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
WARNING: Mac OS X support is very experimental at present...
if you would like to work on improving it, please ensure you have backups
and then run this script again with the --debug flag!
What does "backups" mean in this context? Should I back up my entire hard drive, and proceed knowing that the script could mess up my entire computer?
