Following the wiki I was not able to complete the process
After configuring the Manual Provider with the last successful command:
New-ACMEProviderConfig -DnsProvider Manual -Alias manualDnsProvider
the command Edit-ACMEProviderConfig -List
returned:
Id : xxx
Alias : manualDnsProvider
Label :
Memo :
DnsProvider : Manual
WebServerProvider :
Now I got stuck, because every attempt for the command : "Complete-ACMEChallenge" failed with:
Complete-ACMEChallenge : The given key was not present in the dictionary.
How to continue ?
