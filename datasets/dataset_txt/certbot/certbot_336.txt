When trying to use tools/venv3.py on Windows, I got an error that the virtualenv module isn't available. I installed Python using the standard Windows installer available at https://python.org.
I wonder if we shouldn't just use the venv module in tools/venv3.py which is available in the standard library.
If we did this, we'd also have to change the arguments we provide when running virtualenv/venv because venv doesn't accept --no-site-packages or --setuptools, but venv provides the same behavior as virtualenv does with these flags by default. (In fact, those flags are noops in new versions of virtualenv and those flags are only provided for compatibility with ancient versions of virtualenv.)
@adferrand, what do you think? Same as #6508, if you agree, I'd appreciate a PR with this change, however, I can also write it up myself if you think it's a good idea.
