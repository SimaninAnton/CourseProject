The program nginx (process ID 12345) is already listening on TCP port 80. This will prevent us from binding to that port. Please stop the nginx program temporarily and then try again.
From a usability standpoint I think it would be better to display this warning earlier in the process when running letsencrypt-auto, as I have to re-enter my domain names and go through all the steps. Maybe a kind of list or auto-suggestion feature for domains that I have already used would be nice.
