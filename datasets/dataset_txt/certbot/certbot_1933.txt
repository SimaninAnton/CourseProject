When I try to run a dry run of my certificate renewal process, I understand that since apache2 is listening on port 80, I have to stop it. However, when I do stop it, as soon as certbot "installs" the first certificate, apache2 is started automatically. So the first certificate finishes with a success, and then the subsequent certificates fail because apache is listening on port 80. Rather annoying actually as no matter how many times I stop apache2, certbot (for some odd reason) re-enables it after checking the first cert. Any ideas of what is going on? I am running Ubuntu 14.04 trusty, and naturally my webserver is Apache.
Thanks in advance
