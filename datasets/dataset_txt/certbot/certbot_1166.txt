My operating system is (include version):
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
Ubuntu package 0.12.0-1+certbot~trusty+5
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot renew outputs this warning:
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/OpenSSL/rand.py:58: UserWarning: implicit cast from 'char *' to a different pointer type: will be forbidden in the future (check that the types are as you expect; use an explicit ffi.cast() if they are correct)
  result_code = _lib.RAND_bytes(result_buffer, num_bytes)
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The command seems to correctly renew the certificates but it is a bit annoying because cron sends me an email each time.
As mentionned in #4299, I think this might be fixed by updating the python-openssl provided in the Cerbot PPA.
