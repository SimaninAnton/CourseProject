From @bmw on #5777:
we need to set up a py27-postfix-oldest environment in tox.ini which can be based on the py27-apache-oldest environment and then add this environment to .travis.yml. After that change lands, we'll have to update .travis.yml on the test-everything branch to avoid merge conflicts.
