@bmw and I discussed this offline, the gist of which was:
There should be an easy way for someone to set recommended SMTP configurations for a sending-only server, including the starttls-policy enhancement.
This is a little bit odd for deploy_cert to do since a sender doesn't need a certificate. Solely using starttls-policy to create a Postfix-compatible tls_policy_maps file isn't completely sufficient, either, since we'd like to help configure users' TLS setting correctly as well.
An added piece of complexity is that since this enhancement wouldn't be associated with a certificate, we want to allow the enhance verb to optionally not be associated with a cert, which would need some discussion around a UI change to allow for this without confusing users.
