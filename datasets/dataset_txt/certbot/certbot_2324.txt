hi,
Im running letsencrypt-auto on Debian 8 server with Apache 2.4. We are hosting over a hundred domains and the experience with the domain selection is kinda frustrating:
the domains are show in a very small window, enabling to see only the next 5/6 domains at once
the domains are not ordered alphabetically but in some weird garbled order (maybe by .conf creaton time ?) This makes the navigation very cumbersome.
It would be definitely better if the domains shown would be the domains that are enabled in apache - eg. symlinks in the "sites-enabled" directory as compared to the files in the "sites-available" directory as it is now.
i understand Lets Encrypt wants to push for more web encryption, but maybe a better default for first run would be to have all the domains unchecked, rather then checked. Especially if its a first time user, and hosts many domains, he might spend some considerable time unchecking all he doesnt want to encrypt. Maybe a solution would be a option to "check / uncheck all".
thank you for you consideration and great work !
