As the title says, I would like to issue a certificate for an IP address rather than a domain name. As far as I know, that is generally possible. Not with Letsencrypt it seems. I use ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone and enter the IP address. It tells me that it is not an FQDN and if I want to re-enter it or not. If I press "no", it will exit immediately with the message "Please specify --domains, or --installer that will help in domain names autodiscovery".
