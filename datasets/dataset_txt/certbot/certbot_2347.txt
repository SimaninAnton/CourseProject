using letsencrypt-auto renew --force-renew gave me the following error:
2016-03-01 07:34:57,850:WARNING:letsencrypt.cli:Attempting to renew cert from 
/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/[...].conf produced an unexpected error: You've asked to renew/replace a
seemingly valid certificate with a test certificate (domains: [...]). We will not do that unless you use
the --break-my-certs flag!. Skipping.
renewing the "old way",
/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto certonly --webroot -w [...] -d [...] --force-renewal --non-interactive
worked fine. [edit: formatting]
