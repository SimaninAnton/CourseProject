As suggested here, we should make a certbot-large image for people who want additional utilities available for use with hooks. Thoughts:
It should build off our current Dockerfile
We should stick to common tools we expect people will need and use, but should err on the side of including extra stuff size given the name of the image. At the very least, we need curl (see #4552).
