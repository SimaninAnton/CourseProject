There have a number of times where integration testing has failed for either boulder or the client because dependency or environment changes only taking place in one of the two repos. Recent examples include boulder's use of MariaDB and goose or the client needing the the custom hostname le.wtf.
Ideally, we should create a set of shared scripts and configuration files and make all such changes there to ensure the changes are made in both repos.
