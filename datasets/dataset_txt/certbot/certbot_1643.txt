Our current Dockerfile was largely written roughly 6 months before Let's Encrypt entered beta and it was a convenient way to test the project on different systems. It's in need of an update. I propose we update our Dockerfile to do the following:
Continue installing from our repo rather than OS packages
Remove unneeded OS dependencies after installing Certbot (such as gcc?)
Clean pip cache after installing certbot (or don't use it all)
Don't install the Apache or Nginx plugins
The resulting image should be roughly the size if we simply installed the certbot OS package. If this isn't possible for some reason, we may have to choose a different approach.
