From http://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/:
Write tooling to install and run mypy against your codebase, so that everyone using the project can run the type checker the same way. Two features are important in how you run mypy:
Support for determining which files should be checked (a whitelist/exclude list is useful!).
Specifying the correct flags for your project at this time. For a Python 2 project, I recommend starting with mypy --py2 --silent-imports --fast-parser -i <paths>. You should be able to do this using a mypy.ini file.
