My /etc/apache2 config is ephemeral. I puppetize anything I need to be there. And my vhosts are located in a /web/apache.d folder that is part of an EBS volume I keep when I destroy and recreate the rest of the server.
For anyone that has a similar setup or any other config that keeps their vhost config separate. It would be worthwhile to have options to explicitly specify the path to the vhost file and maybe the le-vhost file as well.
