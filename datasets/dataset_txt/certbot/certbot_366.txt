Basically, as I read from the rfc only one challenge needs to be answered () therefore I respond to the http challenge.
My problem here is that when I do answer_challenge and then finalize_order there is some sort of race condition going on the the certificate request happens first before the requests from letsencrypt hit my server. The rfc mentions that there might be a delay and that me as the client I need to poll.
So I try to use poll_and_finalize but then it fails because it looks on all the authorizations https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/0.27.x/acme/acme/client.py#L680.
My question is, is there a function I can use in order to poll for a single authorization?
