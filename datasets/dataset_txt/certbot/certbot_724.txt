There is a problem with certbot website's documentation. The links are pointing to root's directory (i.e. certbot.eff.org/using.html instead of certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html and therefore the links are broken. Additionally the documentation menu itself displays without CSS applied which I suppose is not intentional either.
I'm not sure whether the people responsible for website even look here so if anyone knows a better place for this bug report I would be very happy to redirect the question.
My operating system is (include version):
MacOS 10.13.3
Chrome Version 64.0.3282.167 (Official Build) (64-bit)
Safari Version 11.0.3 (13604.5.6)
Here is the log of Chrome's dev tools:
Refused to apply style from 'https://certbot.eff.org/_static/css/theme.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.
