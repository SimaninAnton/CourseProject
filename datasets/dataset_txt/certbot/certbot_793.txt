My operating system is (include version):
debian jessie
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS Package manager
$ certbot --version
certbot 0.10.2
The Problem
In my /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini, I had this line which I expected to set the default explicit.
renew-by-default = False
I expected certbot to renew certificates only when they are close to expire.
Instead
Instead, certbot renew always renews a the certificates.
