During development it can be useful to submit a JWS-signed POST (with nonce) to an arbitrary URL containing an arbitrary payload. This option wouldn't really be suitable for general use, but it would be nice to have a "raw" command (or a separate tool) that would use the registered account key to sign a payload and submit it to a provided URL. That would make testing things like letsencrypt/boulder#1846 easier.
