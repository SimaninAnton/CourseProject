I am a mirror for some distribs and for the ntp pool. That means that I have various "loadbalancing domains" that may sometimes go to my server and sometimes not (pool.ntp.org, mirror.archlinuxarm.org, â€¦).
The problem is that when I have to reselect the websites, I always have to cherry-pick the websites I don't want HTTPs activated on (or else the renewal will fail).
A flag such as #CERTBOT_DONT_ASK_HTTPS in the corresponding apache vhost files would be great. It would inform the certbot renewal thingy not to ask me for an HTTPS certificate for this domain.
Thanks,
Cheers
