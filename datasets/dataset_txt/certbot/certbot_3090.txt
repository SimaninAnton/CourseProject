This is another good issue pointed out by @centminmod. How is --email actually used? If you're automating running letsencrypt, should the flag be included every time? Does it need to be the same e-mail address each time? What happens if it's different?
The current behavior is --email is only used if you're creating a new account with the ACME server, otherwise the flag is ignored. Is this the behavior we want? Could we filter/choose your account based on the e-mail address if you have multiple ACME accounts? Even if we do not want to change its behavior, the purpose of this flag should be better documented.
