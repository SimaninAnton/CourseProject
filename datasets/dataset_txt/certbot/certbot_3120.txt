Install letsencrypt and start it on FreeBSD with:
./letsencrypt-auto --agree-dev-preview --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory auth
It killed my complete mailsetup as it starts to install packages using pkg on FreeBSD and does not use the already installed packages.
It uninstalled postfix and installed sendmail, this can be seen as absolutely critical, this needs really to be fixed, as the complete mailsetup on this system is now destroyed and I have to reinstall all manually now.
Suggestion: If you start to install software on the computer with root privileges, ask the user before.
Here the user should get a prompt and endless time to read what he is doing!
I do not even have an idea how letsencrypt can do this, as I was logged in as normal user.
