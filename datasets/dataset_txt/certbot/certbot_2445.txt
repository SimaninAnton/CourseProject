After the recent fixes to save_successor to make it update renewal config files, we now lose renewer options (not renewalparams) such as renew_before_expiry.
We weren't very worried about this because the use of these options isn't documented or encouraged anywhere; probably everyone using them is directly involved with the development of the project, or so we hope. It would be good for the code that updates the renewal config files to not lose these parameters, though!
