gcc: error: /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1: No such file or directory
This is what I get when running the auto install on Fedora 23.
It looks like it's missing a dependency, I determined this by running the pip command separately.
It can be solved by simply running yum install redhat-rpm-config
