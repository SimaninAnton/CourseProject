Unit testing of cli.py's responses to various types of misconfigured plugins is quite an intricate task, because the plugins are not present when unit tests are run, and because mocking out the relevant bits of disco and plugins while keeping the tests meaningful is a very elaborate process.
Instead, we should use integration tests where the plugins are actually available, and we can mock up things like broken Apache and Nginx configurations.
