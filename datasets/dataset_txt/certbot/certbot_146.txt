It's written in Python and it not being installed regularly bites me. I often install it in my venv so I have a newer version available than that provided by the OS without making global changes to my system, but when I recreate the venv, I often forget.
I'm not sure what other devs setups look like, but making this change would make mine easier.
What do you think @adferrand?
