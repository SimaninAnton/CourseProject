Hello,
I am testing the client against another ca server (local boulder instance using docker), and I get the error message "Unable to register an account with ACME server" right after choosing the authenticator. However, the client does not communicate with the ca server (or any other server) while running.
Using it with the default server works. The vm, which im running the client in, can communicate with the ca server aswell as the internet.
