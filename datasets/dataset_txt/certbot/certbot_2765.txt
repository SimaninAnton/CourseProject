The current git-repository (and thus the distribution) contains the complete test environment, including testing-tools, docker- and vagrant-files, examples, the complete documentation.
This is contrary to the security best-practice of installing only the minimal requires software on production systems.
It may even contradict ISO 27002 which recommends separating test and production environment.
