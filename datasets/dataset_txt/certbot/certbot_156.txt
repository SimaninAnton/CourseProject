The questions I have that I'd like exact answers for are:
What architectures does snapd support?
What are the CPU and memory requirements/overhead of running the snapd daemon?
What are the CPU and memory requirements/overhead of running snap which is needed to install packages?
What is the disk space required for snapd?
What is the disk space required for the "core snap" that the Certbot snap depends on? (Alternatively, we could answer what is disk space taken of installing the Certbot snap on a new machine without snapd previously installed.)
