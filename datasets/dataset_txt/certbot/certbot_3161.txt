I have a Mac running OS X 10.10.5 with Homebrew installed already. I attempted install via git clone and the ./letsencrypt-auto with the following results:
$ ./letsencrypt-auto
Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
WARNING: Mac support is very experimental at present...
Warning: augeas-1.4.0 already installed
Warning: dialog-1.2-20150528 already installed

./letsencrypt-auto: line 69: virtualenv: command not found
This was on master at the time, SHA 8e7c8ad. The bootstrap/mac.sh script uses hash virtualenv to test for the existence of the virtualenv package, which returns:
$ hash virtualenv
-bash: hash: virtualenv: not found
But then attempts an install via pip that returns:
$ pip install virtualenv
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): virtualenv in /Users/matt/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages

I upgraded virtualenv as the command suggested (sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv) and then started getting:
$ ./letsencrypt-auto
Bootstrapping dependencies for Mac OS X...
WARNING: Mac support is very experimental at present...
Warning: augeas-1.4.0 already installed

I assume this is somehow related to Python path issues (System vs Homebrew installations). As a non-Python developer attempt to use this tool for my non-Python project I'm not sure how to proceed. I also figured this were one of the kinks that would need to be ironed out before general release, hence filing the issue.
I'll move on to running it one Docker, but on the Mac that means via boot2docker and virtualization so that's hardly a wide audience solution.
