I was adding cert for another domain on my Apache server, where I have another domain. I inputed only new domain in the process. The the old generated config was deleted and thus the server was "misconfigured" and let's encrypt wasn't able to do anything. I had to delete symlink from site-enabled and run letsencrypt-auto once more, but with inputing both domains.
