If you're having trouble using Certbot and aren't sure you've found a bug or
request for a new feature, please first try asking for help at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/. There is a much larger community there of
people familiar with the project who will be able to more quickly answer your
questions.
My operating system is (include version):
CentOS release 6.10 (Final)
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
certbot-auto
I ran this command and it produced this output:
certbot-auto --no-self-upgrade
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
Invalid OCSP response for /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../cert.pem: param thisUpdate is in the future..
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit.

This has happened on two computers in two very different infrastructure systems
Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:
