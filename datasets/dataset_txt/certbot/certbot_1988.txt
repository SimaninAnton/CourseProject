I'm trying to add SSL to my CouchDB database as described here. When using certbot to try to register a certificate for that domain, I got the following error:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: db.pythonista.cloud
   Type:   unauthorized
   Detail: Invalid response from
   http://db.pythonista.cloud/.well-known/acme-challenge/X_F_dkc5wQCl38ZA2HLOdfIC2olLFBhUEP8UihTxdIU:
   "{"error":"illegal_database_name","reason":"Name: '.well-known'.
   Only lowercase characters (a-z), digits (0-9), and any of the ch"

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
because this subdomain hosts CouchDB, which looks for a database with this (illegal) name. How should I proceed?
