I've been following the guide from:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/tutorial-for-os-x-local-certificates-and-shared-hosting/6859/2
and I believe I am doing the steps correctly, but I end up with this type of response with a self-verify failure. I do own the example web domain. When I checked the directory in the SSH the key does exist in there. Anyone have any ideas why it might not work? Or anyone experience a similar response?
