I have installed certbot some time ago. But this time i decided to do a git pull to update the repository in my Ubuntu 16.04 machine, then i rebooted the machine. Then the machine wont start again, its stuck in Booting from hard disk message..
PS: i have auto renew enabled via cronjob. Maybe this is contributed at some point in the issue.
