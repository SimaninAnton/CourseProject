I couldn't find an existing issue for this, but I know we've had trouble here in the past and there was a report of the problem at https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/redirected-ports-break-certbot-apache/33385. We should make sure we handle this properly if a user sets --tls-sni-01-port to a different value.
