My operating system is (include version):
Debian jessie
I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc):
OS package manager
I ran this command and it produced this output:
sudo certbot renew
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/server***.ddns.net.conf
Cert not yet due for renewal
The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/server***.ddns.net/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because:
The issue is that my server went down because of a hard drive failure, luckily, I had a backup from January and restored that backup into a new drive. Now, the server on the failed hard drive already ran certbot renew and everything went well but the one on January had not. Is there a way to get the newest certificates for my restored backup?
Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available):
