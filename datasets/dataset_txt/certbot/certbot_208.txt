As per https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/march-13-2019-end-of-life-for-all-tls-sni-01-validation-support/74209
, TLS-SNI-01 validation is deprecated.
Many users were using this method if their server was not listening on port 80

Yes, using the TLS-SNI-01 challenge. At the moment, Certbot only implements this challenge for Apache. If youâ€™re using the webroot mode, your web server must listen on port 80.
Oops.
When I go through these instructions
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-stop-using-tls-sni-01-with-certbot/83210
It assumes HTTP-01 method.
