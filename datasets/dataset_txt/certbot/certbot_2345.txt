I couldn't get letsencrypt-auto to configure apache automatically, so I first did a certonly via a standalone http server.
After that, if I run letsencrypt-auto and choose:
Attempt to reinstall existing certificate
I get the following error:
                         │ Error in checking parameter list: AH00526: Syntax error on line 24   │
                          │ of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/api-apachevhost-le-ssl.conf:           │
                          │ SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/apache2/insert_cert_file_path' does   │
                          │ not exist or is empty                                                │
And:
Apache is unable to check whether or not the module is loaded because Apache is misconfigured.
