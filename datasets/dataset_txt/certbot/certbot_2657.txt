I've tried using the discovery of domains with letsencrypt and it works great! One small bug in my opinion which forces me to go through all my sites is that the generated certificate is the same for all domains and thus when one connects to https://a.example.org they get to know that https://supersecret.example.org also exists.
Is there an options to get separate certificates for each domain found in the apache config ? If not, could we get one ?
Grouping ServerName and ServerAlias could be a good thing in this use case.
