Hi,
I installed letsencrypt but it fails to run properly
% letsencrypt 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/letsencrypt", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3074, in <module>

    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))

    raise DistributionNotFound(req, requirers)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'acme' distribution was not found and is required by letsencrypt
Any thoughts?
