Currently, the --csr flag breaks under many circumstances because it implies a whole bunch of variations on how certs are stored. None of that seems logically necessary. --csr can work perfectly well with storage.py (it should probably imply --domains <contents of CSR>, etc) and we can have another flag (perhaps --no-lineages or --dump-cert or something) that causes the store-certs-in-the-current-directory-without-lineages behaviour.
