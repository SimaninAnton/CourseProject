i set a tcpserver. it keeps long connection with clinets. the clients may send message to the server and the server may send to the clients. the server call read_until for the client's messages, it gets nothing and keep waiting. now there is something need to be send to the client. how to stop the read_until call and send first?
message = yield stream.read_until( b'\n' ) #there is no message
yield stream.write( 'something' ) #how to step here?
