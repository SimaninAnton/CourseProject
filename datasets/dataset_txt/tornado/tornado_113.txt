For my tornado websockets server, I would like to make sure my on_message() is waiting until open() has finished (open has some tasks takes takes a bit time).
I assume the right way to do it by by using tornado locks (condition variable). However, there is no 'await' in python 2.7. What's the equivalent in python2? Or should I use yield gen.sleep(5) over a loop with some if inside?
