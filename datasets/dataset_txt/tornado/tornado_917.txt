Calling fetch() on a closed AsyncHTTPClient raises a confusing error message (AttributeError on NoneType). This is made doubly confusing by the magic instance-sharing (in which case the close probably happened on what looks like a completely different instance). This should raise a more explicit error and the docs should be updated to explicitly discourage the use of AsyncHTTPClient.close.
