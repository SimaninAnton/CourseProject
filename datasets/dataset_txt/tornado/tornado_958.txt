Is there a way to remove the leading slash generated by static_url? I looked through the source and ended up setting "static_url_prefix" to "static/" instead of the default "/static/".e
However, seems like the URL prefix of "static/" doesn't end up matching any handlers, so a 404 gets returned.
I'm running into a problem where if I run separate apps under different sub-directory URL, then the leading slash returned from static_url() results in the URLs not actually being relative.
For example, I have an app running under http://localhost/app, then the URL returned by static_url() will be "/static/images/logo.png" when it should be "static/images/logo.png".
