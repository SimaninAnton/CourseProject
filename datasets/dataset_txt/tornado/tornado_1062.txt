Context:
Try to run two instances of helloworld.py example
Symptom:
Linux/OS X (expected): second instance raises Address already in use.
Windows: second instance runs happily, but receives no requests until the first instance shuts down.
Cause:
Setting SO_REUSEADDR seems to result in different behavior between Windows and other platforms.
I don't know if it makes sense to simply skip setting REUSEADDR on Windows or what, but it would be nice if tornado's behavior was consistent.
