Can't seem to find in the docs or in the code the right way to implement a simple tornado websocket proxy, that just creates a very simple server, and:
Once a connection is opened (open), connect to the other server
Once a message is received (on_message), forward the message to the other server
I just need a way to do some create_connection with the ability to pass on_message callback.
