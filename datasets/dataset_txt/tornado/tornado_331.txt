RequestHandler.finish may call flush(), which returns a Future, but this Future is simply discarded. The main reason for that Future is flow control in streaming responses, which is no longer relevant by the time we are closing the connection, but it also contains errors if the stream is closed while the response is streamed. This error will be logged as a stack trace if left uncaught, so some applications may wish to await their calls to finish() to be able to catch it.
This logic also extends to render(), which calls finish().
