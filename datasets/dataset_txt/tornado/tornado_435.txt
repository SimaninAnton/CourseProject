Inside https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/stable/docs/guide/templates.rst, after the line
"If you saved this template as "template.html" and put it in the same directory as your Python file, you could render this template with:"
There should be a little note to explain that the variable are not handled in a classic way when using
render
Usually you intend to do variablename = othervariablename , in other words, othervariablename value goes inside variablename
When you use render of tornado.web, the operation is reversed
othervariablename = variablename, in otherwords, variablename push his value to othervariablename and only after that you can use othervariablename in your html file.
Give the two variable the same name does not allow to understand this particular mechanism when you learn tornado until a painful learning from failure process
