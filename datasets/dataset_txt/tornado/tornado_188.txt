From the queue.Queue.get docstring
If 'timeout' is a non-negative number, it blocks at most 'timeout' seconds and raises the Empty exception if no item was available within that time.
From the tornado.queues.Queue.get docstring
timeout may be a number denoting a time (on the same scale as tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.time, normally time.time), or a datetime.timedelta object for a deadline relative to the current time.
I found this confusing. I wanted to verify that it was intentional.
