I'm trying to call options.parse_config_file() and then options.parse_command_line(). I define log_to_stderr=True in the config file. Both of these functions will call the enable_pretty_logging function so that they will add two handlers into the logger. I think that's a bug even though I can configure the logger manually. It should check if there is another StreamHandler in the logger.handlers list before it adds a new one.
If I don't define the log_to_stderr=True, parse_config_file will create a file handler and parse_command_line will not create a stream handler since the logger.handlers is not empty. I don't want to call parse_command_line before parse_config_file because I want to override the config file in command line.
