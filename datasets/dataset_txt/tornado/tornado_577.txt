i'm using a slight modification of the facebook example code. I've started getting a lot of these:
[W 151111 19:52:46 auth:113] Error response HTTP 503: No server is available for the request fetching
[W 151111 19:52:46 auth:113] Error response HTTP 503: No server is available for the request fetching https://graph.facebook.com/XXXXXX
Funny thing is, the first try always fails (when using tornado's async http client), but the second one goes around.
I've replaced that bit of code with urllib.urlopen("http://graph.facebook.com/XXXX").read() and it works perfectly.
Now, i'm sure there's likely something wrong on the facebook side, as i've open a ticket over there as well, but maybe we could make all of these requests on an external api in auth.py at least 2-3 times retryable?
