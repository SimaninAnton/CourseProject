In my Tornado app in some situation some clients disconnect from server but they can't send close event to the server. I currently use ping to find out if client is disconnected.
now I want to set SO_RCVTIMEO in tornado instead of using ping pong method.
something like this :
sock.setsockopt(socket.SO_RCVTIMEO)
Is it possible to set SO_RCVTIMEO in Tornado for close clients from server after specific time out ?
