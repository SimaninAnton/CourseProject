tornado/test/gen_test.py and its copies uses string exceptions which have been removed from python 2.6:
http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6.html (see deprecations and removals)
grep "raise \"" tornado/test/gen_test.py -n
171:                raise "did not get expected exception"
182:                raise "did not get expected exception"
196:            raise "did not get expected exception"
they should be replaced by Exception("string")
