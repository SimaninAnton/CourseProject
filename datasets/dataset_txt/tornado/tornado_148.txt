I would like to write dynamically genereated Images into a tornado reply. Issue 1922 was similiar and has beenclosed with a hint to stackoverflow. Unfortunatetly such questens (even with bounty) have not been answered
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51785365/genrerated-image-not-in-tornado-reply
A working example can be found here with BaseHTTPServer
https://github.com/vkuehn/simple_mjpeg_streamer_http_server/blob/master/mjpg_http_streamer_server/mjpg_streamer_http_server.py
I used version e.g. Python 3.6.5, Tornado 5.0.2
as I don't like to mix a tornado solution, hint to documentation etc. is greatly appreciated !
