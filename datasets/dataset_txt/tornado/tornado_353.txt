Some windows users are reporting "No supported color terminal library" errors at startup (the reports so far are by jupyter users; I don't know whether there's something about jupyter that is linked to this error or if that's just a large source of tornado-on-windows users). It looks like this can occur if colorama is installed but colorama.init has not been called.
