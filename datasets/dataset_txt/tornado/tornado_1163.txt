As mentioned on python-tornado mailinglist here and on the django-users mailinglist here, it seems Tornado isn't properly unquoting the PATH_INFO before building the environ passed to the application.
This breaks URLs like http://example.com/browse/new%20york/ when running Django as a WSGI application on Tornado.
