There's some require_setting logic that keeps me issuing a pull request.
I'm hoping to simply override a proposed method named get_cookie_secret that by default returns the cookie_secret application setting.
An upstream driven cookie secret would be very useful for several internal projects I'm working on where there are already established authorization cookies that can help create per session cookie secrets.
