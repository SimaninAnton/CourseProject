Since this commit http://github.com/facebook/tornado/commit/aa836cdf3952d52efc68201872b3a0053aca33ad
there is always mistaken css style constructions appears if I've defined css_files(), but haven't defined embedded_css():

<style type="text/css">
.......
</style>
That's because you're filling css_embed with inclusion path.
   if css_files:
        ...
        css_embed = ''.join('<link href="' + escape.xhtml_escape(p) + '" '
                            'type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>'
                            for p in paths)
        ...
    if css_embed:
        css_embed = '<style type="text/css">\n' + '\n'.join(css_embed) + \
            '\n</style>'
I think you'll find the same problem with embedded_javascript() and javascript_files()
