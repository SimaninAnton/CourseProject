some of the translated language strings in locale.py seem to be corrupt.
for example Japanese is listed as "name": u"\xe6\xe6\xe8" when it should be "name": u"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e" or '\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e' in utf-8
I think this problem is limited to the translated strings for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (all 3), but I'm not qualified enough to verify all the others.
