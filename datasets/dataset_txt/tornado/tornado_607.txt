I'm trying to use a global dict to store user information, including permission. When a user logs in, the auth view query user information and save it into the global dict with user name as its key, and set a username cookie.
The problem is that when I start my app in multi processes mode, some logged in user request can not find its information in the global dict. It seems that only the process receiving the request will query and store the user information.
A way to solve my problem is to use a cache service such as redis or memcached to store cache data.
The websocket chat demo also use a class static variable to store connections. Does it have the same problem?
