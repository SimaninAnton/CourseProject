I am trying to install Tornado 5.0.1, getting this error -
pip install tornado
Collecting tornado
Using cached tornado-5.0.1.tar.gz
Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/tmp/pip-build-t2xMkH/tornado/setup.py", line 146, in
raise ImportError("Tornado requires an up-to-date SSL module. This means "
ImportError: Tornado requires an up-to-date SSL module. This means Python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+ (although some distributions have backported the necessary changes to older versions).
Upgraded python version from 2.7.5 to 2.7.13
Upgraded openssl version from 1.0.1e 2013 to 1.0.2o 2018
Still getting the same error.
The part of code in setup.py from where this error is raised, when i put that in a separate python script and run it, control is not even entering that block.
Previously had tornado 4.5 but needed an upgrade in order to use multiprocessing.
Any help regarding this is deeply appreciated.
