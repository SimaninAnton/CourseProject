First off, thanks for all of your work on tornado! I've been using it as the core of a raspberry pi webcam server, and I use tornado.auth.GoogleMixin + a white list to handle authentication.
As of May 19, Google closed registration to new OpenID 2.0 clients. (link and semi-relevant stackoverflow). I believe this affects new programs that use tornado.auth.GoogleMixin, as well as all of the OAuth examples that use it. At the very least, the documentation needs an update. This:
No application registration is necessary to use Google for authentication or to access Google resources on behalf of a user.
is no longer true for new clients.
