HTTPErrors are logged less verbosely than other errors. Some applications may wish to define their own error classes and handle them specially in write_error, and these exceptions should be treated more like HTTPError than a general uncaught exception. There should be some sort of hook to determine whether an exception needs the full stack trace to be logged.
