Hi, I’m surveying Python’s TLS implementations and saw that your client code uses DEFAULT:!SSLv2 for ciphers.
That’s pretty bad because that also enables export ciphers et al. howsmyssl’s take on it can be found here.
I’m also pretty sure you don’t disable TLS compression and the false stems from my OpenSSL disabling it for everyone.
Due to #764, this can’t be fixed by API users.
For reference, urlib3 went this way: urllib3/urllib3@2088570
