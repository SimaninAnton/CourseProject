Hi,
Kind of new to web developing and tornado here (using version 4.5.3 and web hosting is done by nginx). I was just freaked out by a peculiar error. First, just let me have a little bit explanation on my situation. I'm in a area where extremely strict internet censorship is applied, which blocks some websites that I need for my work. So I bought a commercial vpn to get access to those sites. When I'm not on vpn, tornado works fine with 'localhost'. But, when vpn is on, Debian 9.2 (or 9.3?) doesn't allow me to deploy:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/xxxx/.PyCharmCE2017.3/config/scratches/tornatorial.py", line 45, in <module>
http_server.listen(8888, address='localhost')
File "/home/xxxx/PycharmProjects/xxxxx/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/tcpserver.py", line 142, in listen
sockets = bind_sockets(port, address=address)
File "/home/xxxx/PycharmProjects/xxxx/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/netutil.py", line 197, in bind_sockets
sock.bind(sockaddr)
OSError: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address
I thought I would have to turn on and off vpn back and forth to keep work on, which really sucks. But I didn't give up and finally found out that when I'm not using the 'address' argument in 'http_server.listen', it strangely works out!? Basically I just did the following change:
from:
http_server.listen(8888, address='localhost')
to:
http_server.listen(8888)
The issue is already fixed. I'm just so interested in what the hell was happening there and I was so freaked out! Can someone help me out. I appreciate it.
Thank you in advance!
