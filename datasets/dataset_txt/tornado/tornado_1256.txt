Any plans to switch the Facebook Mixin in auth.py over to their new way of authenticating users? Looks like the mixin currently uses the deprecated Facebook Connect method. While we're at it, it would be awesome if the facebook login url could be easily overridden for Facebook's "m" and "touch" subdomains for mobile devicesâ€”subclassing a few dozen lines of code to simply change a few characters in the login url seems a bit silly.
