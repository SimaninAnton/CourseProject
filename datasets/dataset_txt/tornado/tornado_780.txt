It seems like it would be useful to have something like this in tornado, for the times when you want to asynchronously sleep.
def async_sleep(seconds):
    future = concurrent.Future()
    ioloop.IOLoop.current().call_later(seconds, lambda: future.set_result(None))
    return future
This would then let you do something like so:
yield async_sleep(0.5)
If there's already a one-liner that does that, I haven't found it yet.
