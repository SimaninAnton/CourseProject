Hello,
I have one handler method decorated with @gen.coroutine:
class MyHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):

    @gen.coroutine
    def post(self):
        ...
When I execute performance test on this API, my service is able to execute 3 or 4 requests per second maximum.
If I simply change @gen.coroutine to @gen.engine and I execute exactly the same performance test, the service is able to handle around 50 requests per second.
What is the reason for this performance difference between the two decorators ? Is my @gen.engine usage wrong ?
Thanks!
