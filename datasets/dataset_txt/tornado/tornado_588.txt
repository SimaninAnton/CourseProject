The default behavior of the CurlAsyncHTTPClient is similar to curl -L 'https://apps.dresden.de/ords/f?p=1110' when I set follow_redirects to True and max_redirects to 50. which leads to the following error HTTP 599: Maximum (50) redirects followed
What I would like to do is enable the Client to behave the same way as curl -c cookiejar -L 'https://apps.dresden.de/ords/f?p=1110' but I can't seem to find a work around this using the HTTPRequest API.
