It would be convenient to reduce CPU use when sending large memoryviews of data. I've brought this up a couple of times
#1685
#1691
And it has been raised by @bryevdv for websockets
#2102
Previously I've closed my issues saying that this wasn't yet a bottleneck for my applications (dask). However now several users are using Dask on HPC systems with fast multi-GB interconnects and this has now become a bottleneck. I'd like to revisit the issue.
Are there any objections or known challenges to handling memoryviews all the way from user input to system call? (other than developer time of course) I'm able to spend some cycles on this problem, but I'd like to verify that it's feasible and check in with core devs to see if there is anything that I should be aware of before starting.
