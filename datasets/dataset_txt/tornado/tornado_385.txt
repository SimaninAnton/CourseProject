Tornado does not currently follow HTTP 308 redirects, even if the HTTPRequest follow_redirects parameter is True.
More info about HTTP 308 redirects can be found here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308
The New York Times is using HTTP 308 redirects to redirect some requests from HTTP to HTTPS, you will see a 308 redirect if you attempt to fetch this page:

The fix is to check for a 308 status code in _HTTPConnection._should_follow_redirect.
