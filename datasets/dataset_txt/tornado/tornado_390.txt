Some http server response without status message, like "HTTP/1.1 200",
in the following line, "parse_response_start_line" expects an space after the status code, as the docstring says "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".
https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/httputil.py#L849
But the regular expression is written as "(HTTP/1.[0-9]) ([0-9]+) ([^\r]*)", which can match "HTTP/1.1 200 " but not "HTTP/1.1 200", and HTTPInputError("Error parsing response start line") is raised.
Make the space optional with ? gives the expected result.
