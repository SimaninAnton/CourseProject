I've been trying to get my previously passing tests to pass under tornado 5.0.1
I removed all uses of IOLoop (#2302) and also fixed an issue with define(#2146). I can't seem to figure out what would cause
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Pool.release.<locals>._release_impl' was never awaited
I'll attempt to recreate an offending test here unless there is a common issue that would cause the above (which I'm hoping).
