The _signature method of tornado.auth.FacebookMixin uses the application secret when signing the requests. This causes all the authenticated requests to the Facebook API fail since the requests should be signed using the session secret. I guess Facebook has changed their API at some point. http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Authorization_and_Authentication_for_Desktop_Applications
