I'm trying to call both http_server.start(0) and tornado.platform.twisted.install(). The http_server.start(0) requires that IOLoop instance must not be initialized before it, while tornado.platform.twisted.install() will make the IOLoop instance be initialized. But the install function need to be called before any twisted code. That places me in a dilemma.
