I build a image base on Python3.6.5，and install tornado 4.5.3. My server receive http request with post and call other http service with IOLoop add_callback
I use Apache Benchmark (ab）test with 2000 requests, 100 users. Most of the request are not returned immediately and timeout, and server looks like blocked.
But run the server on the machine not in docker container, Or update tornado to version 5.x run in container that's fine.
