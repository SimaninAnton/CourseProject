There's only one method in the speedups module that performs some masking arithmetics.
It shouldn't be that hard to provide a CFFI module that does exactly the same (with cleaner code).
Do you guys think we should convert the C extension into CFFI or just add a pypyspeedups module with the same functionality?
Will PyPy benfit from calculating the masking arithmetics in C?
