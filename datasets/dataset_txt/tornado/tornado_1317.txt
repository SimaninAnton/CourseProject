Is there a way to hook up middleware into tornado. Process every incoming request and then route it to the handler.
I am trying to handle urls with trailing slashes -> ex: /login/ & /login
(r"/login/?", LoginHandler),
Using a regex solves the problem but have a slight doubt that it kills some performance. With middleware we can do something like url.rstrip('/')
