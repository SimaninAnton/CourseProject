At the start of my application this gets called:
AsyncHTTPClient.configure(CurlAsyncHTTPClient, max_clients=1000, defaults=defaults)
The defaults can change while the app is still running. I was not able to re configure AsyncHTTPClient without restarting the app.
Is there a way to do this?
I am currently calling this line below as a work around:
delattr(AsyncHTTPClient, '_async_client_dict_' + AsyncHTTPClient.__name__)
Thanks!
