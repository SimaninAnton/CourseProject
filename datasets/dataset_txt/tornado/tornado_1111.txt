I'm getting a large payload via. AsyncHTTPClient and have been very surprised at how slow everything's going (only about 15mb). It takes about 2 minutes for my response callback to be called.
Whipping out cProfile, it looks like almost all the time is being spent in _merge_prefix. Switching this back to cStringIO (commit 6ac2c58 for anyone interested), takes my execution time down to about 4 seconds (and there aren't any hotspots in cProfile).
I'd be happy to submit a patch to fix this. Any suggestions on the right way to do it?
