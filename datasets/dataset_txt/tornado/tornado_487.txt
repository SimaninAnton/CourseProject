I am having a situation. Where can i cache a pandas dataframe or python dict in a particular RequestHandler. I want to avoid the file read and conversion for every hit to the URL. First time when the URL is triggered read the csv file and store into cache. Currently for every hit i am going the file read and conversion operation.
