To call add_timeout function, you need to call time.time sys function, that's heavy, when has a lot of time-based events, It is a heavy burden for cpu.
https://github.com/mayflaver/tornado/blob/master/tornado/ioloop.py#L759 I think we can store the timestamp in every ioloop, when call add_timeout, we can use it.
