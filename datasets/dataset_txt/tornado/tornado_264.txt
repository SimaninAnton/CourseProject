Doing await queue.get() on a empty asyncio.Queue never resolves even though something is put in the queue later.
This only happens when using asyncio.Queue with Tornado's event loop and using await queue.get() when queue is empty.
This doesn't happen when using asyncio's event loop or when using tornado.queues.Queue.
I'm using Python 3.6.3 and Tornado 4.5.2
