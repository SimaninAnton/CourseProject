Hi there,
One of our user is using a proxy that sends a 301 for a redirection.
Unfortunately by default curl will change a POST method to a GET when following such a redirection.
It is possible to change that behavior by setting CURLOPT_POSTREDIR to 3.

Would it be possible to let the possibility to override that parameter ?
Thanks.
