You’re shipping Mozilla’s trust database with tornado so you can verify certificates. That’s awesome but it burdens you with keeping it up to date (and it isn’t very fresh at the moment either).
I would like to suggest to depend on certifi instead that’s also used by requests. That takes off the burden to keep yours up to date and people won’t have Mozilla’s trust DBs of various freshness all over site-packages.
