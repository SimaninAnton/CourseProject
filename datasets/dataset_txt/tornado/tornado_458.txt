getaddrinfo will return IPv6 addresses when the system doesn't support it, and Tornado will then fail to connect to the IPv6 address with this error (I get a report for my project here):
OSError: [Errno 97] Address family not supported by protocol
I see in #593 AI_ADDRCONFIG was removed from bind_sockets, and in #823 Tornado just ignores the unsupported protocol. But this is about connect, not bind. What do you think, to use AI_ADDRCONFIG or just ignore the error? There's currently no way to pass the flags to resolvers though.
