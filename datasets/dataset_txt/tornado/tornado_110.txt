Im trying some weeks now to connect to a websocket that has bad ssl cert and i cant figure out how to connect with tornado.websocket.websocket_connect() without verifying the cert. Any help?
i have tried this with no luck:
request= tornado.httpclient.HTTPRequest(url=self.url, validate_cert=False)
w = yield tornado.websocket.websocket_connect(url=request, connect_timeout=5)
