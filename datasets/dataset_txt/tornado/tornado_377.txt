This code:
self.set_status(http.client.BAD_REQUEST)
, when being executed in a query made by curl, produces this HTTP status line:
HTTP/1.1 HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND Not Found
This is caused by enum.Enum's working as ints in most contexts (such as being used as list indices) but not when being cast to str.
Version 4.2.1
