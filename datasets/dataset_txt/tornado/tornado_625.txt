I am building my rest api using Tornado 4.2.1 with Python 3.4.
If I try to send a delete request (the same with put) the request arrives to the server and it performs its duty, but the rest client (I am using the Firefox rest client) never receives the response.
I have tried the following codes:
    def delete(self, company_id):
        company_model = CompanyModel()
        company_model.delete(company_id)
        self.set_status(NO_CONTENT)
    def delete(self, company_id):
        company_model = CompanyModel()
        company_model.delete(company_id)
        self.set_status(NO_CONTENT)
        return
    def delete(self, company_id):
        company_model = CompanyModel()
        company_model.delete(company_id)
        self.set_status(NO_CONTENT)
        self.finish()
In order to make it works I have implemented the following:
    def delete(self, company_id):
        company_model = CompanyModel()
        company_model.delete(company_id)
        self.set_status(ACCEPTED)
        self.write(json.dumps(dict()))
