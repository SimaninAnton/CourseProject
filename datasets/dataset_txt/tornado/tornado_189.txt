When use multi processes in tornado, the child processes inherit the socket fd from father process, so the child processes also listen the same ip-port, and they can receive data from the inherited socket.
reuse_port param of socket means child processes can bind the same port of the father process binded. This use also make child processed and father process can bind the same port to improve the speed of the server.
so when use multi process in tornado, what is the difference between reuse_port=True and reuse_port=False? It seems that there is no need to use reuse_port=True, because the child processes inherit the socket fd and they can receive data from the same port socket
Thanks !!
