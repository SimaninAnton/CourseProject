I have read the source code of the tornado these days, the version is 4.4.2.
I just found one question that I can't figure out:
I start 24 processes for testing, my system is using epoll, and add a print in the code
https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/branch4.4/tornado/netutil.py#L260
In my suppose, the print will be called 24 times if I send whatever request to it, but actually, the time is less than it.I changed the number of process about 10, the result is right. And I found that the problem is that the code https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/branch4.4/tornado/ioloop.py#L862 is not called in 24 times.
So why?
Or just give me a keyword that I can search for.
Thanks in advance.
