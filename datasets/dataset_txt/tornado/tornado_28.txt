Hi,
When I use set_secure_cookie in tornado, the cookie is returned by the server but the client does not save the cookie in ios and therefore authentication fails. It is the problem with cordova-ios and wkwebview.
So while I cannot solve the above problem, is there any other ways to authenticate? I do not want to store the cookies in local storage manually.
