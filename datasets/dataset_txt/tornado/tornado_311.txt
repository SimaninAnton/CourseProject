Hello all!
When tornado logs an exception it writes out the repr of the HTTPServerRequest to the application log. The repr includes all of the headers in the request including Authorization and Cookie headers. Writing user secrets to logs is probably not a good idea. What's the right way to solve this at the framework level?
Don't include any headers in the repr of HTTPServerRequest.
Filter out sensitive headers from the repr.
Don't log the repr of HTTPServerRequest at all in log_exception(). Without the headers, it just restates the content of RequestHandler._request_summary().
Do nothing, it's not a big deal and/or it's a back-compat issue.
Something else?
I can submit a patch, but I'm curious how the community feels about this.
Cheers,
Fitz
