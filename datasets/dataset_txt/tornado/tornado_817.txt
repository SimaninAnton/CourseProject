I have a websocket server implementation using Tornado. It seems to work fine for my use-case. The only problem that I have recently started seeing is that after the last message that I get from my client, exactly after one minute of that, the websocket connection closes and the on_close handler that I have implemented gets fired.
On the client (browser), I get 1006 i.e. abnormal termination.
I thought that its either a bug in my server code or the client code as the connection seemed to be breaking after exactly one minute which is too accurate to be abnormal. So I thought I might have added a timeout.
I am not sure what might be happening. Being new to Tornado also doesn't help much with ways to debug the probable issue.
