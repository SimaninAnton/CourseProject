The synchronous HTTPClient leaks memory for each request made since upgrading to Tornado 5.0.1.
from tornado import httpclient

while True:
    try:
        http_client = httpclient.HTTPClient()
        response = http_client.fetch("http://localhost")
    except Exception:
        pass
    finally:
        http_client.close()
Running this script for 3 minutes in docker (python:3.6-stretch):
tornado==4.5.3: 18.52MiB / 1.952GiB
tornado==5.0.1: 350.28MiB / 1.952GiB
Note, I cannot seem to reproduce the issue on macOS.
