I'm using (a lot) logging through tornado.log. Each time I implement a little bit more complex handler, I'm adding some tornado.log.gen_log.debug("I'm doing some stuff"); to keep trace of what I'm doing and obviously to help maintenance and debugging.
However, since tornado has a great asynchronous pattern, I have logs mixed across simultaneous requests. It makes debugging impossible !
The easiest solution would be to add reference of HTTP request concerned by the log line. The question is then: how to do it ?
