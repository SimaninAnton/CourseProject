Hi,
Is it possible to get an ordered dict for a post request?
class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def post(self):
        request_dict = self.request.arguments
the request_dict here is a dict type, but it is possible for me to get as an ordered dict?
the end point I am sending this form data requires some elements appear on the top. Is there a way to just get the whole dict back with the same order when i submit?
Cheers,
