Setting the cookie works perfectly until I try and set the domain. Here is what I'm doing:
self.set_cookie('emailaddress', email_address, expires_days=expire_d, domain='mydomain.com')
If I remove the domain part or set it to None it works fine, but than I'm not able to use the cookie across subdomains.
