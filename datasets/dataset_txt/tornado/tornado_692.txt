In PHP it is possible to have form elements be named in a way that allows for associative arrays (basically dicts) when processed on the server.
I did a little digging and noticed that the parse_qs function is tiny which makes it easy to hack against and I came up with this: https://gist.github.com/emehrkay/484cf1dc814f8c8a2e1e
It basically allows you to pass in something like:
   "name[first]=mark&name[lastx][hi]=male&key=val&list[]=1&list[]=2"

    #and get
    print parse_qs(s2) #{'list[]': ['1', '2'], 'name': {'lastx': {'hi': 'male'}, 'first': 'mark'}, 'key': ['val']}
What do you think? Useful?
