I'd like to be able to use python 3.5's async/await syntax as much as possible. However, when I implement a WebSocketHandler and use async/await in the on_message handler, tornado gives me the following error:
/home/jaapz/Programming/mijnbaopt-websocket/.env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/websocket.py:417: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'on_message' was never awaited
But when I use tornado.gen.coroutine as a decorator on the on_message method and use the yield from syntax inside it, everything works as expected.
The async/await syntax does work on the prepare method of the WebSocketHandler, so it would be nice if it'd also work on on_message.
