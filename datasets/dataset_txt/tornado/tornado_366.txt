Hoping you can provide me some pointers.
I have a fairly simple HTTPServer but when the server closes the connection I never see the socket object dealloc'd/GC'd. I've instrumented the socket.py code to show when the objects go through init and exit and for these particular objects I never see the exit called.
Could this be because it was only a half close on the other side is holding the socket open? Is there anything I can do in the IOStream or TCPServer code?
Thanks in advance
