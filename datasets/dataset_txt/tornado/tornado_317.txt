Currently i can't find way to divide DNS errors from another, when getting exceptions from CaresResolver
I just get Exception("C-Ares returned error 11: Could not contact DNS servers while resolving example.com"). In newer versions of tornado i see Exception is replaced with IOError. But anyway, this does not help in general.
Can you advice right way to handle it? Currently i can just parse error message to detect such errors.
Perhaps it is possible to replace this exception with inherited class to provide ability to handle C-Ares exceptions?
