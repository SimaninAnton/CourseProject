Whenever you have the XSRF feature turned on and POST to a url that is not handled within your code. (404). The "tornado.web.ErrorHandler" raises the error that the XSRF token is missing.
Worse yet, if you GET to a url that is not handled within your code. (404) The token is created.
The code that handles XSRF is in "tornado.web.RequestHandler" and "tornado.web.ErrorHandler" inherits from "tornado.web.RequestHandler". I suggest that the "xsrf_token" and "check_xsrf_cookie" methods are overridden to ignore creating the XSRF and ignore checking for the XSRF token.
If you want me to code this up and submit and pull request let me know.
