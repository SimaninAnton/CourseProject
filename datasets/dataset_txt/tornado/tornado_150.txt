The example TCP server shown in the IOLoop documentation doesn't work correctly with Python 3.7 (and probably earlier versions).
This is because the handle_connection function is declared async, however is never awaited or otherwise scheduled, therefore doesn't actually run when a connection is established.
Upon running the snippet and connecting with nc 127.0.0.1 8888, the following warning is output:
ioloop_example.py:23: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'handle_connection' was never awaited
