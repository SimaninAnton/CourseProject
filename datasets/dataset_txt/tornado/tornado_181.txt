Hi, looking for help if any on this.. herokuapp was working fine with my python program (that uses tornado) up untill today. Now, on pushing the latest version, I got this error:
remote: -----> Python app detected

remote:  !     We recommend upgrading by specifying the latest version (python-3.6.5).

I tried down-grading the tornado version to 5.0 but even that gave the same error. The app is running fine on my local system, but I'm not able to deploy it on my heroku site.
