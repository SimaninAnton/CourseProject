The last example Asynchronous and non-Blocking I/O on using yield would cause a SyntaxError because you can't have a yield and a non-empty return in python 2.7
from tornado import gen

@gen.coroutine
def fetch_coroutine(url):
    http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
    response = yield http_client.fetch(url)
    return response.body  # <-- SyntaxError
