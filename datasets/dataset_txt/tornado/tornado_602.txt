I'm getting the following error with Tornado:
No handlers could be found for logger "tornado.application"
I've read through the docs, and it appears that I need to define this:
access_log = logging.getLogger("tornado.access")
app_log = logging.getLogger("tornado.application")
gen_log = logging.getLogger("tornado.general")
but then what? What do I do with these things? The error isn't going away.
also note that this is the first line of my main() function:
tornado.options.parse_command_line()
I've also explicitly added this:
logging.basicConfig()
Also, I've noticed that all my 200 level requests are being routed to stderr, instead of stdout, how do I redirect that to stdout. I only want the 500-level errors to go to stderr.
Thanks!
