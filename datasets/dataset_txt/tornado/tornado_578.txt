Hi there,
I suffer a situation that some server will return header_data without reason like:
HTTP/1.1 200
Server .....
....
and that will cause function parse_response_start_line in httputil.py raise HTTPInputError
Is it possible to change the regular expression from
match = re.match("(HTTP/1.[01]) ([0-9]+) ([^\r]*)", line)
to
match = re.match("(HTTP/1.[01]) ([0-9]+)\s*([^\r]*)", line) 
that could make such case passed successfully.
Thanks!
