in web.py on 347 there is
self._new_cookies.append(new_cookie)
I have a cookie with a 'flash' key, then I'm trying to overwrite it, but in result I have 2 cookies with same key and the browser set the last one:
flash=; expires=Tue, 25 Jan 2011 08:36:57 GMT; Path=/
flash="eyJtZXNzYWdlIjogW10sICJlcnJvciI6IFtdfQ==|1327480617|8011a5339bcf4a55b93e7aca03589fd7f229410c"; expires=Thu, 26 Jan 2012 08:36:57 GMT; Path=/
I my opinion it should be overwritten, but not appended
