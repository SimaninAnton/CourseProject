This affects the Simple HTTPAsyncClient; the curl client does not seem to suffer:
If an IO error (e.g. dns lookup failed) occurred in a fetch, then any exception thrown in the callback reaches the ioloop's handle_callback_exception.
If an HTTP resposne is received (200 or error e.g. 404 or whatever; anything as long as the io succeeded) then any errors thrown in the callback (e.g. response.rethrow(), or even assert or other exception) will just be printed to the log as 'uncaught'. The ioloop's handle_callback_exception is not invoked.
If you schedule a callback to be called - ioloop.add_callback - from the fetch callback, and at a later point that callback, on its own slice of the looper, throws an exception, then that too is not caught by ioloop's handle_callback_exception.
