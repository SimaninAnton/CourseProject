I am using jupyter 4.4.0, ipython 5.3.0 with python 2.7.12 on ubuntu 16.04. I recently installed jupyter using pip. But as soon as I open a notebook, the kernel dies with the following error.
RuntimeError: IOLoop is already running

I have tried cleaning up jupyter from pip list and reinstalling. But this doesn't work. I also referred to #1796, doesn't solve my purpose. Any leads on this?
