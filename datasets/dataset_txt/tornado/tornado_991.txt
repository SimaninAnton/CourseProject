I'm using a fork of Bret Taylor's 'socialcookbook' (https://github.com/finiteloop/socialcookbook) which uses "import tornado.database" - and it's worked perfectly until yesterday (the 3.01 build?) and now I'm getting an ImportError: no module named database when I compile on Heroku.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
