We have a mixin class in Jupyter which primarily adds periodic pinging to a websocket handler. This is useful when websockets are used behind proxies, as some proxy servers will kill the connection if it's unused for a set amount of time - 60 seconds in nginx (see #1070).
This seems like a generally applicable bit of functionality for websockets. Are you interested in including it in tornado? I imagine that this would be disabled by default, but could be enabled by a setting websocket_ping_interval. I am happy to work on this if you think it's in scope for tornado.
