Looking at the official guide/async, the async example shows the method:
def asynchronous_fetch(url, callback):
I wonder if the argument callback is correct since this would imply that calling the method would need to provide that callback.
I am just starting out with Tornado so I admit that I have no clue about it, but looking at another example on StackOverflow which uses that same example, it makes way more sense to me for the async method to have this signature:
def asynchronous_fetch(url):
StackOverflow example
If it is a small mistake, I'd suggest to fix it soon since this trips newbs big time when they try to wrap their head around the async concept in Tornado (speaking from experience :) )
