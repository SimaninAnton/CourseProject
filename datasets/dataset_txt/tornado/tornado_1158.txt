Currently, Firefox 6 and up are the only browsers that implement the latest standard of WebSockets. The new draft standard is somewhat backwards incompatible with the "current" draft standard, so Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly are all broken with the WebsocketHandler. Soon, Chrome and Opera will adopt the new standard.
There aren't a whole lot of huge changes, so it should be pretty simple to simply abstract out the protocol to use whatever the browser requests.
If nobody has started work on this, I can take a stab at it.
