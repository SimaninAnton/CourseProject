Today we will raise a exception if we hava a stream greater then max_buffer_size, here some @schlama thougths.
Bottle.py - https://github.com/defnull/bottle/blob/d89d676a6510541e679fac1ac1e8a5745eb87f76/bottle.py#L1050
Flask.py - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/fileuploads/#improving-uploads
so, the idea is to use TempFile if stream is big.
