This problem is also related to the changes 2to3 introduces adapting _stack_context_handle_exception.
Line raise type, value, traceback becomes raise type(value).with_traceback(traceback). However, certain exceptions, such as UnicodeDecodeError can't be constructed with a single argument. In Python 3, the correct syntax would be raise type(*value.args).with_traceback(traceback). However, I've failed to come up with a Python 2 equivalent that 2to3 would automatically translate correctly. In fact, something like raise type, *value.args, traceback isn't even valid.
