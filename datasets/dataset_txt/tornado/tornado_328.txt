I found myself needing and using the following utility function in Dask
def in_ioloop():
    """ Are we running within the current IOLoop? """
    return IOLoop.current()._running and IOLoop.current()._thread_ident == threading.get_ident()
However in the future I would prefer to avoid depending on private API. This leads to two questions:
Is this the right way to check if our code is currently running within a Tornado event loop?
Is it reasonable for something like this enter the public Tornado API?
