Today, I find out that all 10 tornado process on my server were all blocked, and can not serve any HTTP request.
First, I use strace -p pid to see what happened on it.

No any system call.
So, I use pyrasite to see its function call stack.
It seems that the tornado process is stay in _GzipMessageDelegate.data_received() and can not break out forever.
What happen ? Is it a known problem ?
Environment:
CentOS release 6.7 (Final) x86_64
Python 2.6.6
Tornado 4.2.1
GzipDecompressor class rely on zlib module, which rely on zlibmodule.so
