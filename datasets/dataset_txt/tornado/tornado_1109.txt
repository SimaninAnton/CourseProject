Websocket messages used to be text, but are now always binary Blobs. This has broken the bundled chat demo, which assumes that event.data is json-parseable text, which it is no longer. Other apps (IPython Notebook) work the same way, and are broken with current tornado, as would, any application that expects text in a websocket message.
I don't know enough about websockets to say whether the current or previous behavior is correct, but obviously either the example or the code needs some change to get the text out of the blob.
