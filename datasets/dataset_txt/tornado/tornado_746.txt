This stack trace line is from Tornado 3.2.1 (but continuing into the latest code in lines 317-328):

AssertionError: Body must not be empty for "PUT" request
The HTTP specification doesn't require content for these requests (although it discusses the content). The fact of calling a PUT or POST may be all that is required to change the system's state.
There's discussion here:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2010JulSep/0273.html
Some example use cases:
PUT: I want to tag an artifact named on the URL with the tag also provided on the URL
POST: I want to check the session named on the URL to see if it's still valid (and by doing so extend its validity if it is still valid).
