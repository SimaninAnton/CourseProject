ubuntu has an unofficial pycurl python3 port which causes a failure in the curl testsuite of tornado 2.4.1.
in this port Curl().setopt takes a unicode string instead of bytes as utf() returns
this leads to these failures:
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tornado/curl_httpclient.py", line 273, in _curl_setup_request
    curl.setopt(pycurl.URL, utf8(request.url))
TypeError: invalid arguments to setopt


  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tornado/curl_httpclient.py", line 293, in _curl_setup_request
    [utf8("%s: %s" % i) for i in request.headers.get_all()])
TypeError: list items must be string objects
as the patch is unofficial and not yet accepted upstream (see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3188495&group_id=28236&atid=392779) there is probably not much you should do
I just filed this issue so you know about it and maybe have an opinion on ubuntu's patch.
