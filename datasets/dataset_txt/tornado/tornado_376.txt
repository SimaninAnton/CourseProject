Is there a mechanism to log an error or even raise an exception when a future is not waited for?
For instance, if I accidentally left out a yield like
@coroutine
def c():
     tornado.gen.sleep(10) # missing yield
     yield 1
I considered adding another check in tornado.concurrent that acted towards a result similarly to when an exception is not consumed. However I quickly noticed that there are times in the http request where a coroutine is not yielded (e.g. web.py#L2123).
