Many years' worth of documentation explains that folks can do
from tornado.platform.twisted import install
reactor = install()
I can see that in 004de9c#diff-77b5a8a33248ef0bcafbc1bb71e9f013 Twisted integration was removed, since we can all depend on the stdlib loop APIs. This is great, but it also breaks a bunch of Jupyter notebooks, tutorials, etc.
Could you be convinced to replace all those sprawling APIs with something like this:
def install():
    from twisted.internet.asyncioreactor import install
    install()
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    reactor.startRunning()
    return reactor
possibly with a warnings.warn explaining that users could just call these APIs directly, if that's the desired end-state?
