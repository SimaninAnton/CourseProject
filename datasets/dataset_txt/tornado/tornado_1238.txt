An app I'm developing with tornado occasionally quits its main loop unexpectedly:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "pbs3.py", line 129, in 
    run_server(opts.port, opts.configPath, opts.debug)
  File "pbs3.py", line 115, in run_server
    ioloop.start()
  File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/tornado-1.1-py2.6.egg/tornado/ioloop.py", line 234, in start
    if (getattr(e, 'errno') == errno.EINTR or
AttributeError: 'exceptions.KeyError' object has no attribute 'errno'
I know this traceback is pretty useless. It seems the try/except in start() should be catching all possible exceptions to prevent the main loop from quitting, but is missing something.
