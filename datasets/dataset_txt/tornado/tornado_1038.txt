Hello,
I want to apply a function to the template source before is parsed by the Tornado Template engine.
Like Jinja2 Preprocessor method http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#low-level-api
Can I do something like this without touching the template loader?
If not, should be good add this option the templates (preprocess = [method1,method2,..])
Thanks!
