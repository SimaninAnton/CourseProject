I was running into issues with a JSON Api I was building for cross domain requests coming from Firefox/Safari that were sending an HTTP OPTIONS pre-flight request before sending the http get. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
My Fix http://github.com/araddon/tornado/commit/d91deae5f22e6d0cd3b86d5b960729ae004bd394
I was able to get Firefox/Safari to work correctly by implementing an "options" method on my handler similar to get/post but actually just returning nothing.
