I'm sure I'm missing something here since it seems like such a basic issue, but here's what I'm running into. In short, the body of a request is coming across just fine, but for some reason RequestHandler's built-in get_arguments seems to be non-functional. Code is below:
class CreateUserHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def post(self):
        print self.request.headers.get("Content-Type")
        print self.request.body
        print self.request.body_arguments
        print self.get_body_argument("email")
This then prints the following:
application/json;charset=UTF-8
{"email":"slater@indico.io","password":"password"}
{}
WARNING:tornado.general:400 POST /user/create/ (::1): Missing argument email
WARNING:tornado.access:400 POST /user/create/ (::1) 1.66ms
How is it possible that the body comes along fine, but body_arguments can't be found? I added the Content-Type header since I see that's relied on pretty heavily when processing body args, but I wasn't able to find the spot in the codebase where this might be happening.
