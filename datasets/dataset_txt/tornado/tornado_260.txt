I came across a small problem when attempting to authenticate through an OAuth server that required a scope param to be supplied while obtaining an authorization code. Currently, a scope argument will have its characters interleaved with spaces due to this line in auth.py:
args['scope'] = ' '.join(scope)
currently at line 600 (found in OAuth2Mixin.authorize_redirect). I locally altered my tornado version to remove the spaces and my login succeeded.
