I've noticed that parse_command_line() has a side effect of changing the log level even if no command arguments are given. This caused me to miss the autoreload info messages when I decided not to include the parse_command_line() function because I didn't think I needed it.
Wondering if this side effect was intentional, and if it is possible to remove.
Example:
import logging

from tornado.options import parse_command_line

logging.info('before parse_command_line')
parse_command_line()
logging.info('after parse_command_line')
