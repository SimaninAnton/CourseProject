I'm trying to intercept/add some behavior in the Jupyter Hub DockerSpawner by introducing a "derived" class, more specifically the start method. Unfortunately most methods are @gen.coroutine and overriding this with a similarly defined function (including the decorator) cause a bunch of errors.
Can someone perhaps point me in a possible solution here, bearing in mind that I would still need to be able to call the original method(s)?
