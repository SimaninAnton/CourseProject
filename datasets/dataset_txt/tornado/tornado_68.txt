Looks like tornado == 6.0.2 has some breaking changes from 5.X.X when used with Jupyter Notebook's nbconvert package. See this related issue for more info: jupyter/nbconvert#978
If this is a conscious breaking change on a major version release, feel free to close this issue. Just looking for clarification, thanks!
