HTTPError is a subclass on Exception, however, a message argument is ignored. Therefore a top-level exception handling block should always include a special clause for HTTPError.
Here is an example:
   try:
      ...
  except Exception, e:
     # will throw AttributeError when the actual exception type is HTTPError
     logging.debug("Exception message: %s", e.message)
