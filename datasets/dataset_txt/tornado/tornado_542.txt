How about splitting tornado's code into folders? For instance, we could rename web.py to __init__.py and put it inside a /web folder. After that, we are able to move handler classes to a file web/handlers.py and import it on init file.
Some files in tornado seems like a "god modules". I think they know too much. If we move code this way, we won't have troubles with legacy code, once we'll be able to set __all__ variable.
Also, tests must pass without any changes.
