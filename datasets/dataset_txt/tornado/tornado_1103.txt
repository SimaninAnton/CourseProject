I have a 3rd party api that requires me to send a basic-auth user name but a blank password. However, Tornado's CurlAsyncHTTPClient does not set the basic auth headers when the password is an empty string. Using the SimpleAsyncHTTPClient works as expected.
It is the difference between checking if the parameters are None vs. simply checking if they evaluate to False. The curl client checks if they evaluate to False, whereas the simple client checks if the username is None.
