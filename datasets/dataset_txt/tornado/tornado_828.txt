Alternative API to add delayed callback
IMO the decision back in #329 was bad. A method should not serve multiple purposes based on the type of an argument. Plus, it is really inconvenient to write loop.add_timeout(datetime.timedelta(seconds=x), callback).
My proposal is to introduce a method equivalent to PEP-3156's call_later. Maybe something like add_delayed_callback(seconds, callback) (preferably shorter, but I didn't come up with a better name matching Tornado's API style). Additionally, passing timedelta objects to add_timeout should be marked as deprecated.
Support for _args and *_kwargs
It is strange that add_callback supports passing _args and *_kwargs while add_timeout not. So I would recommend adding support for them to the add_timeout method (and possibly to the new one from above).
I can contribute if any of these proposals get accepted.
