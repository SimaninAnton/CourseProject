I don't know if this is a bug or expected behavior, but I think I'm running into a situation where I want to close a stream, and then immediately reconnect. The problem is that when I call close on it, it doesn't cancel cancel read callbacks and so I end up getting AssertionError: Already reading. Is this something that can be fixed in tornado, or do I need to figure out a workaround. Any ideas?
