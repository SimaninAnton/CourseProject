here is my code:
@gen.coroutine
 def post(self):
        url = 'https://api.github.com/users/AUS3RIS'
        res = yield AsyncHTTPClient().fetch(url, raise_error=False)
and the error is TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'raise_error'. But this told me that raise_error exist. My tornado version is 3.2 or 4.0.
