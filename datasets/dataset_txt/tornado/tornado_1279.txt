Code to test this behavior is at http://gist.github.com/390142.
Basically, tornado.websocket will not parse messages past the first one. This is a major bug. I looked through the source and couldn't isolate the issue, so I'm hoping someone else can.
Tested in Webkit, version 4.0.5 (6531.22.7, r58691) and Chrome 5.0.375.29 beta.
I forked Tornado and verified a fix. Here's the commit that brings websocket.py back to life: dlo/tornado@9ea5f8a277db96557ae7867375c7db4d8c5f633a
