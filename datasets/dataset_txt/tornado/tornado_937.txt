Apostrophes are valid attribute delimiters in (X)HTML, so the escape/xhtml_escape routine should escape them (preferably as &#39; rather than &apos; due to the HTML 4 bug).
Backticks have also been supported as attribute delimiters by some browsers, despite being non-standard, so they might merit escaping too.
