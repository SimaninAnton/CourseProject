When I call handler.settings.debug in tornado template, It will throw an error duo to handler.settings is python Dict. It can not access to its attribute like handler.settings.debug
Actually, tornado itself has util.ObjectDict() or we can use collection.OrderedDict

I post this issue here. and let us talk about it. If everyone like to access this, I will make PR ASAP.
