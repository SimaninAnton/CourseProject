I am using tornado-celery for web's callback, and it depends on tornado.IOLoop.add_callback.
As I know IOLoop.add_timeout comes with a specific interval, and how about IOLoop.add_callback? does it have a fixed interval set by Tornado? or IOLoop.add_callback comes with no interval and is based on IO events?
I just can't find detailed information from Tornado documentation.
I just want to set a fixed interval of IOLoop.add_callback.
