In checkin 7b846ea the code for httpclient.HttpResponse.body was changed to throw a ValueError when the body is empty.
But since the message body is optional throwing an ValueError seems not right because it is not an error. Can it be reverted back to the 5 behavior of just returning a None when the body is empty.
