I'm looking for the appropriate place to do some set up before the first websocket message is handled. I was considering using WebSocketHandler.open, but it isn't clear to me whether (a) this can be a coroutine, and if so (b) would it be guaranteed to complete before the first call to on_message.
Looking at the code suggests to me that the answer may be "no", but I'm not familiar enough with the code to know for sure.
(If this is the wrong place to post such questions, please let me know - I wasn't able to find an official mailing list or anything like that.)
