tornado.netutil.bind_sockets attempts to use the same port on IPv4 and IPv6 if port=None.
It does this by first letting the kernel assign a port for one protocol, and then explicitly requesting the same port for the other protocol. However, I think the port space for IPv4 and IPv6 is independent, so there is no reason to assume that the same port is necessarily available for the other protocol. The second bind can (and occasionally does) fail with EADDRINUSE.
What's the rationale for using the same port?
The behavior was added in this commit: 151eef7
