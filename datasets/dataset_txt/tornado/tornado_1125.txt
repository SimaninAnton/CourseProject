I recently ran into a bug with the Python standard library where a standard library was sending RFC non-compliant HTTP requests: http://bugs.python.org/issue13132
Despite being RFC non-compliant, the requests actually work in the following web servers:
Apache2
Nginx
Twisted
I was attempting to write a lightweight cheese shop server using Tornado but this is currently blocking me since the request can't be parsed.
Despite not being compliant with the RFC, I think that web servers should do their best to serve any requests, just as web browsers do their best to serve malformed responses and markup. I propose that Tornado should handle the following separator cases for headers:
\r\n
\n\n
\n
