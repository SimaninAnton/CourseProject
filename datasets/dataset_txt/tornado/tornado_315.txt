Testing with js, if I use an ajax call with "GET," it receives what it should. If I change it to "POST" an error is thrown on both client and server side.
The server side error is as follows WARNING:tornado.access:405 OPTIONS / (127.0.0.1) 2.12ms
I have tried running the ajax call both from file://index.html and localhost:8000/index.html with the same result in both cases.
