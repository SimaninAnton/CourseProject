According to the specs http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1:
HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST include the "close" connection option in every message.
So the way I read this: if configuring HTTPServer with no_keep_alive, it doesn't support persistent connections by definition and must set the "Connection: close" header.
