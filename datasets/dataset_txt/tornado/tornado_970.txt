It should be possible to pass more SSL options through HTTPRequest (specific example: ssl_version, for servers that only accept a specific version instead of the ssl3/tls1 hybrid handshake we use). Ideally this would be the same ssl_options/SSLContext option as seen in the server-side configuration.
