In python 3.4, due to the lack of http.util.responses W3C sanctioned name for code 422 (Unprocessable Entity), tornado/web.py at line 1522 converts the exception into a 500, if reason is not specified.
If reason is specified, a 422 is raised, but the reason is actually never used, which is kind of unexpected.
I would expect the code to raise a 422 regardless if the W3C sanctioned name is found.
