hi,
i'm debugging a very strange issue in our tornado using application, and what i'm finding on a small number of user's machines, is that after tornado is imported, the execution of the program stops. (i.e. subsequent imports don't take place).
i've asked users to run the application with the -vvv flags, and have received this log:
https://gist.github.com/jonathon-love/06eaf7433f7ee84b9d569f852bf0225e
(if you scroll to the bottom of the log, i have a comment describing things with line numbers).
we had this issue with earlier versions of tornado, and so we tried updating to the 5.0 series, but have found the same issue (with multiple users).
our application performs the following imports:
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.netutil
import tornado.httpserver

from tornado.web import RequestHandler
from tornado.web import StaticFileHandler
from tornado.web import stream_request_body
from tornado.concurrent import Future
from tornado import gen

# this is never imported ... the execution seems to stop here ...
from .clientconnection import ClientConnection
is this something tornado related? or something else?
with thanks
