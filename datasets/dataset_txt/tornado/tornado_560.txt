In start() method within class PollIOLoop, line 826, file ioloop.py
 for callback in callbacks:
     self._run_callback(callback)
 for timeout in due_timeouts:
     if timeout.callback is not None:
         self._run_callback(timeout.callback)
In the above code snippet, we could find the time events are handled after callbacks. If so, the time events would be delayed in a random way. Processing time events earlier is less dangerous than delaying them in practice.
