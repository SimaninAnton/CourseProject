I have a code where I have to pass a callback (kw)argument which is used by the wrapped function for some other purpose. It would be nice to have a way to tell the coroutine wrapper not to "eat" it.
Looking through the code, I see there is a replace_callback boolean in the coroutine function, but there is no way to set it when using it as decorator. And even if there was, it is not propagated to the wrapper anyway.
For now I have worked around it by calling _make_coroutine_wrapper directly with replace_callback=False, but it feels a bit clumsy.
