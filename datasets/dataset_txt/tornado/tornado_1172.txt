Are there any plans on including POP3 and IMAP (and possibly different protocols) clients in tornado?
I'm currently working on asynchronous implementations of both (with former almost finished).
Now I'm wondering if should I add them into my repository and issue a pull request or just start a new project all by myself?
Currently, they don't match HTTP asynchronous client convention (they're not divided into simple and full-blown one, there's no connection "caching").
They're almost compatible with Python's built-in poplib and imaplib.
This is an overview of POP3 client: https://gist.github.com/971309
