Currently, the OpenID realm is hard-coded to begin with "http://" which does not work for SSL-based sites. I have created a patch (which now should be devoid of my other junk) to fix this:
http://github.com/funtoo/tornado/commit/94c25d5f617822c5d953940840b751c2cdba34ef
This allows SSL-enabled sites to work correctly, so that the OpenID spec is followed, which specified that the return_to path must consist of the realm plus additional subpaths.
