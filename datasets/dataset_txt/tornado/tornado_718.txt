We attempting to build a File storage and file serving service using tornado.
Our solution thus far has been passing around streams to more or less "smartly" proxy the file to and from our cloud storage backend to and from the end user.
We began seeing performance issues and did some profiling with plop.
It seems that a lot of time is spent in SSL related function. However when we mixed in AIOHTTP we saw a performance increase.
The relevant code is here
And the issue boils down to could Tornado's performance be limited by the SSL implementation or is there some other caveat that's being overlooked here?
