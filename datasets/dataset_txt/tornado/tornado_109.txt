I have a function that is a network call (blocking), that I want to 'fire and forget' and run on a different thread . (No Futures / co-routines / etc.)
From one of my functions I run the instruction:
tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().run_in_executor(None, long_blocking_call)
However, if there are exceptions in the long_blocking_call, they are never shown. Why? How to solve it?
I don't need the calling function to wait (yield) to the anything returned by the run_in_executor result, because I don't want to block any code after the run_in_executor line.
I use python 2.7, tornado 5.1.1
