A simple example http://host:port/v1.0/path/223-342-324-234/
user will write in URLSpec partner like /v1.0/path/(\d{3}-){3}\d{3} with regex group.
But in tornado, the Application call method will recongnize a sub group like /(xxx)/(xxx) as params args then pass it to post/get/.....If a user did define params list in method, it will casue error.
I don't think this method is correct. If one user give this regex /(\dab)+(\dcd)+/, RequestHandler will parse it to two params.
So, guys, shall we change another way to got the args or drop it?
