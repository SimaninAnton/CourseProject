I have a set of templates that are being used for multiple purposes. For example:
<!-- template.html -->
<div id="title"> {{ handler.locale.translate("title") }}</div>
# en_US.csv
title, "Apple"

# de_DE.csv
title, "Apfel"
This is all good until I want to use the very same template for another page and use these instead:
# en_US.csv
title, "Cherry"

# de_DE.csv
title, "Kirsche"
In this situation I either:
have to use a separate key (e.g. apple_title, Apple) for the title which will make CSV bigger and I also have to duplicate the template and change handler.locale.translate("apple_title") accordingly.
or I can have a separate set of locale directories and based on some criteria, update the locale dictionary entirely. Something like:
locale
    apple
        en_US.csv
        de_DE.csv
    cherry
        en_US.csv
        de_DE.csv
But I don't know how to go with this approach. How can I tell locale to load from another directory? Or maybe even better, load from default directory and then override some specific values from nested directory. Do you have any suggestion? Is there a better way of doing this?
