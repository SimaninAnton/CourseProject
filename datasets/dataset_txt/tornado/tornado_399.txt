Hi,
I'm getting this error when playing with tornando queues module.
Error at: "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tornado/queues.py", line 179
It seems this error was fixed already into python 3.4.4 but it was not applied into Tornado. Issue has been discussed at:
python/asyncio#268
And the fix is posted here:
gvanrossum/asyncio@76d9d17
Any idea when or if the tornado queue module will be upgrade?
I'm running tornado 4.3 however I see there is no change into 4.4.2 version.
Thanks,
Leo
