i try to test my web appliaction on tornado . i use the code like below
this is within a asynchttptestcase Class
response = self.fetch('/group', headers=self.headers, method="DELETE", body=json.dumps(mockdata))
            b = json.loads(response.body.decode())
but it can't get to my delete method , and i saw the doc ,it seem to not supporting http delete method ? can u guys add this feature?
