I use original websocket in javascript, which is OK to add a subprotocol; And I use tornado httpserver to handle websocket subprotocols, which is also perfect; Now I'm trying to crate a python websocket client, but I figure out that it seems impossible to change the subprotocol using websocket_connect(). So do you plan to add sudprotocol as an argument in the future? Or I should use another way to create a websocket client which supports subprotocol in python?
