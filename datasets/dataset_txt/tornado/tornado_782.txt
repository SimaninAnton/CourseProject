The Tornado's same-origin policy seems to cause issues with localhost, namely due to the numerous ways of specifying the localhost name. This is specifically an issue with the emacs websockets library.
For context, see pull request ahyatt/emacs-websocket#35.
How can a developer using the emacs websockets library know what hostname to use to connect to the Tornado server, "localhost" versus "127.0.0.1", versus a different system hostname? The origin is the same.
I'd suggest relaxing the checks for localhost. If you are using some standard localhost naming convention that I may not be aware of, I'm happy to change my code to suit.
