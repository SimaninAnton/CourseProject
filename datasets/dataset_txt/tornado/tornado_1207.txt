Hey guys - thanks for the awesome project!
HTTPRequest.protocol is not correctly set when using the HTTPServer with ssl_options. Connections made over SSL are reported to use HTTP.
The problem seems to be that HTTPRequest.__init__ isn't passed any protocol information from HTTPConnection (which should know that the connection was made over SSL).
