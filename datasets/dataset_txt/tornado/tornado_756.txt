In my application i have do send via websocket a huge amount of data. Something like 10000 dictionaries per second. Each dictionary i JSONed as a string of ~ 180 chars.
I tried:
WebSocketHandler.write_message() for each dictionary
one WebSocketHandler.write_message() call with a serialized list of 10,100, 1000 dictionaries.
It's always the same result.
Client dies because a low level protocol error (1002) without other explanation.
I noticed sometimes Client can't decode frame because it find a character (x) on byte x. I mean: char (181) in position 181 or char(42) in position 42 and so on.
I can figure out something on tornado.websocket code confuses on frame position with frame length.
