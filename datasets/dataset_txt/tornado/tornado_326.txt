Hello,
I want to host tornado application from my computer so that other computers which is connected to my network can access.
Here is my code.
http_server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(application)
http_server.listen(8888, address='xx.xx.xx.xx')
tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
I could not able to access through IP address. Its working only with localhost.
console : tornado.access:404 GET /favicon.ico (xx.xx.xx.xx) 8.00ms
Is there something am missing in this config.?
