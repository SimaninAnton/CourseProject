On windows, and when connecting with IE, you get errors like these:
  WARNING:root:Read error on 652: [Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly   closed by the remote host
  WARNING:root:error on read
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\tornado\iostream.py", line 361, in _handle_read
       if self._read_to_buffer() == 0:
    File "C:\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\tornado\iostream.py", line 428, in _read_to_buffer
      chunk = self._read_from_socket()
    File "C:\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\tornado\iostream.py", line 409, in _read_from_socket
      chunk = self.socket.recv(self.read_chunk_size)
  error: [Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
It looks like the error number maps to WSAECONNRESET: "An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host."
The error messages clutter up the error log, no other effects.
Pull request on its way.
