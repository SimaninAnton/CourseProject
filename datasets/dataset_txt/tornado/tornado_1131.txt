Was occasionally seeing multiple callback invocations in a single PeriodicCallback interval.
The problem is with the _schedule_next() function. On a fast machine, the current_time can be equal to the _next_timeout!
The fix in PeriodicCallback._schedule_next() is to change:
     while self._next_timeout < current_time:
to:
     while self._next_timeout <= current_time:
