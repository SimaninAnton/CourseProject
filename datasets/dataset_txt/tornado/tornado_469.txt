I've looked at http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/tcpclient.html and it doesn't seem enough to actually start using TCPClient.
Is there some example available somewhere?
I mean, I run:
t = TCPClient()
t.connect('localhost', 1111)
tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
I see that connection is established and localhost:1111 sends data to t. Now, where do I put the async code which will be triggered when this data is received? I'm pretty-sure sure such a basic thing have been addressed already but I still have problem locating it at http://www.tornadoweb.org
