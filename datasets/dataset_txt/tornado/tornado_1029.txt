When setting the xsrf_cookies to True, tornado does not set _xsrf cookie, but keep checking the _xsrf field in request. Of cause the _xsrf field is empty since there aren't any cookies there. So i keep getting 403 errors. Does anybody encounter such problems? I'm using tornado 2.4 and python 2.7.3.
PS: I thought it might be someting wrong on tornado's cookie function. But when I disabled the xsrf function and reboot my app, the cookie function works fine, and I tried again with xsrf on, the problem came back, but will disappear if I manually call the xsrf_token function. So I don't think my cookie's not working. So the only reason I can imagine is the xsrf_token is not properly called when the app starts. Does anyone get this wierd problem? I don't find any reports or solutions on Google.
