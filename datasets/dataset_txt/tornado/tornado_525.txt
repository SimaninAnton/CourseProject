I have been battling an issue with tornado and my websocket ending up into the frozen iostream codepath, and infinitely looping. I have been attempting to upgrade to tornado to 4.3 but I keep running into problems. I successfully upgraded to 4.0.2 and my problem did not resolve.
The issue I am having with 4.3 is the singledispatch requirement. When I try to install singledispatch directly, it complains about not having a module named setuptools. When I try to install python-singledispatch, I end up with a strange response:
ts7800:~# apt-get install python-singledispatch

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  python-singledispatch: Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.5-5~) but it is not installable
                         Depends: python-six but it is not going to be installed
                         Depends: python:any (< 2.8) but it is not installable
E: Broken packages
But python is 2.7.9, so within the range:
ts7800:~# python --version
Python 2.7.9
Does anyone have any suggestions of how to resolve this?
