HTTP1Connection._parse_headers assumes that headers are in latin1 encoding
tornado/tornado/http1connection.py
Line 493 in 93ae079
 data = native_str(data.decode('latin1')).lstrip("\r\n") 

This is compliant with both RFC 2616 and PEP 3333, but there still exists an issue with cookies, which are saved in system encoding by some browsers (IE8, for example) and are not escaped. In our project we experienced this issue and introduced a fallback mechanism.
Werkzeug has also introduced a workaround: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/blob/c16acc75429bf33734b27ad2efdc6ff0774077c8/werkzeug/http.py#L846, which seems harmless enough
@bdarnell, what is your opinion?
