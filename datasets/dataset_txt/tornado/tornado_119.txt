hi,
i'm basically having this issue: https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/faq.html#why-isn-t-this-example-with-time-sleep-running-in-parallel with websockets.
inside on_message() i go await asyncio.sleep(5), but for those 5 seconds no more websocket messages are received.
is this by design? (i appreciate websockets aren't send-respond, so the case for await inside on_message() isn't as strong)
sorry if i'm overlooking something obvious (i did ponder if it was a quirk of the websocket client queueing requests up, but i don't think that can be the case)
with thanks
