Since the recent reorganization of the release binaries/tarballs for tornado have been published, the tornado 2.2 tree (as are releases that are not the most recent for a particular version) is broken due to 404. The download URLs need to be updated in the simple index file to reflect the new path https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/archive'.
For example, for the 2.2 release:
http://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-2.2.tar.gz
This should instead point to:
https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/archive/v2.2.0.tar.gz
All of the following links in the https://pypi.python.org/simple/tornado/ need to be updated:
1.1 download_url
1.2.1 download_url
1.2 download_url
2.0 download_url
2.1.1 download_url
2.1 download_url
2.2.1 download_url
2.2 download_url
2.3 download_url
2.4.1 download_url
2.4 download_url
