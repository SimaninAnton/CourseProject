We had a .csv file that was saved in UTF-8 BOM. Tornado then does not load the first line for translation. We could fix this issue by saving the file as UTF-8 without BOM.
According to this thread on stackoverflow the issue might be here:
f = open(full_path, "r", encoding="utf-8")
which should check if there is a BOM or not. Unfortunately python does not to do this by its own :/
