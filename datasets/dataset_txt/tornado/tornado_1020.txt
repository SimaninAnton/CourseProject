I found the options.parse_command_line method always throws tornado.options.Error: Option 'host' requires a value. This was when I was passing a "-myoption=option" like argument to my program, and I found that the sys.argv automatically partitioned the option argment. so the equal variable in Tornado's source code will always be None. This happened on my computer running both python 2.7.3 and python 3.3 and on windows platform, while my Tornado version is 2.4.1. Linux platform not tested.
