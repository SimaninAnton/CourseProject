This really confused me for like 10 minutes! The doc at docs/guide/security.rst currently says:
By default, Tornado's secure cookies expire after 30 days. To change this, use the expires_days keyword argument to set_secure_cookie and the max_age_days argument to set_secure_cookie
When I think it should say:
By default, Tornado's secure cookies expire after 30 days. To change this, use the expires_days keyword argument to set_secure_cookie and the max_age_days argument to get_secure_cookie
Note the bolded word for the difference.
max_age_days is a parameter of get_secure_cookie() and not set_secure_cookie().
