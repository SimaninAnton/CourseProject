I have some request like GET localhost:8888/test?token=Adsf77fljg+fdajl086POfs, I use get_query_argument function to get the value and I got 'Adsf77fljg fdajl086POfs' .
I found some code like name = nv[0].replace('+', ' ') in tornado, it seems that tornado force replace '+' with ' ' in query parameter.
I want to know why tornado do this and how can I get the value without replacing.
