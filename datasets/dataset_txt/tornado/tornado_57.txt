I know tornado.web.RequestHandler can do chunked responses by calling self.flush(). I am using tornados templates and am building a very large html file using self.render() to render the template to html. Is it possible for tornado to render the template and deliver a chunked response while it is rendering?
Looking at the source code it doesn't seem to be possible because tornado first renders the whole template. Can anybody confirm that this is not currently possible? How difficult would it be for me to implement something like this?
