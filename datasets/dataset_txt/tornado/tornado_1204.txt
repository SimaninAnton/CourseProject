Requesting a WebSocket connection with url ws://localhost:8895?foo=bar results in error message (chromium):
Error during WebSocket handshake: location mismatch: ws://localhost:8895/?foo=bar != ws://localhost:8895/
The handshake URI seems to be using self.request.path which does not including the GET parameters.
Should self.request.uri be used instead?
