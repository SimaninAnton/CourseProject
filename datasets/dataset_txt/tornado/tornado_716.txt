Websocket servers need a way to limit the size of messages they will accept. The max_body_size limit applies to individual message fragments, but there is no limit on the number or size of fragments that make up a message. The websocket compression support (that is new in 4.1) will also need to be made aware of size limits, like the gzip support for http bodies in 4.0.
Flow control is also an issue; we should allow on_message to return a Future similarly to data_received.
