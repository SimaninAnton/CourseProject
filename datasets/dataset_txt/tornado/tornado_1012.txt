if the TastCase inherits tornado.testing.LogTrapTestCase and runing under nose, test will fail because:
File "/Developer/python/beginner_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado/testing.py", line 355, in run
assert isinstance(handler, logging.StreamHandler)
AssertionError
According to tornado document, "This class assumes that only one log handler is configured and that it is a StreamHandler. This is true for both logging.basicConfig and the “pretty logging” configured by tornado.options."
I think they have familiar effect, using each one is ok. So it's a conflict. Fix it or document it:)
