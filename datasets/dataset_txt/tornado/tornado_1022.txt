Uncaught exception, closing connection.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/lib/python2.6/site-packages/tornado/iostream.py", line 311, in wrapper
    callback(*args)

    remote_ip = self.address[0]
IndexError: string index out of range
This exception occurs sometimes while listening on a unix socket.
I think it was introduced @e5d5d3241f81fa7ad5052079ba9cf6b2daf7c25b, could it be that when the client connection has been already closed the socket.family attribute is missing and getattr fallbacks to socket.AF_INET as default value?
