I see these warnings in my tornado logs when a client is attempt to send some data over a websocket to the server using a CA authorized certificate.
Here is the full error:
WARNING iostream.py:659: error on read: [SSL: DECRYPTION_FAILED_OR_BAD_RECORD_MAC] decryption failed or bad record mac (_ssl.c:1754)
When this happens my connection is dropped immediately.
I am running Ubuntu 16.04 on AWS with kernel:
Linux ip-[MASKED] 4.4.0-1022-aws #31-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 27 11:27:55 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
OpenSSL version:
OpenSSL 1.0.2g 1 Mar 2016
Should I be concerned?
