Documentation states:
'''
The callback is called every callback_time milliseconds.
'''
To that should be added something like this:
'''
Unless a particular execution of the callback takes more than callback_time milliseconds, in which case, the sucessive executions will follow immediately until it is back on schedule.
'''
