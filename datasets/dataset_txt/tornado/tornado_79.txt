Hi! Excuse me, if this has been discussed. Search isn't finding anything similar.
Any particular reason, why it's not allowed to do this kind of stuff when using RedirectHandler out of the box?
url(
        pattern=r'/?(?P<lang>ru|en)?/public/(?P<id>\d+)/',
        handler=handlers.Item,
        name='item',
    ),
    url(
        r'/?(?P<lang>ru|en)?/public/(?P<id>\d+)', 
RedirectHandler,
        dict(url='/{lang}/public/{id}/'),
    ),
