The commit f6f7f83 introduced a new implementation of IOStream.
In select (possibly kqueue as well?) a read event is generated when a socket is closed with zero bytes on the socket. In the old implementation of IOStream this was caught by the following code:
Lines 193-195 of iostream.py:
    if not chunk:
        self.close()
        return
In the new implementation the socket is never closed under these conditions thus the read event will keep firing off on the socket.
