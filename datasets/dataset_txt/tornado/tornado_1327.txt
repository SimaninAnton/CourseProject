The prototype for a start_response method is as follows:
def start_response(status,response_headers,exc_info=None):
See here: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#the-start-response-callable.
The version in Tornado does not take the exc_info parameter meaning it is not possible to run a number of middlewares under it. It's an easy one to fix though :)
