I don't have any more specific details (at the moment) but i recently found that after upgrading to torando 1.2.1 (from a really old version) that RequestHandler.on_connection_close() was no longer being called at the end of a request.
I've temporarily moved to chaining my code from self.finish() as a workaround.
