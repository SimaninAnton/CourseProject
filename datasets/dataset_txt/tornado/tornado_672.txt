This threw me off until going through the tornado source code. Given the query parameter foo=bar%20:
self.get_argument("foo", None) will evaluate to "bar" (i.e. no trailing whitespace.)
self.get_arguments("foo", None) will evaluate to "bar " (i.e. with a trailing whitespace.)
This is because the second argument in get_argument is the default value, whereas in get_arguments it's whether to strip whitespace.
What if we gave get_argument and get_arguments the same interface, to prevent others from making the same mistake? i.e. get_arguments would have a default value argument.
I'd be happy to make a PR if yes, but I realize this would be very backwards-incompatible.
