A companion to #2234, this issue is a place to track or suggest issues/PRs that aren't yet fixed/merged in master but should be included in the 5.0 release.
(The fact that this is empty doesn't mean that I'm planning to take master as it is for 5.0. I haven't done a pass over the queue yet to see what makes my list. I'm just opening this up to suggestions before I finish that)
