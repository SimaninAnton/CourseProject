I ran into this issue when testing using multiple processes and threads. We sandbox our test processes using multiprocessing and were getting this cryptic error.
I found a blog post @toumorokoshi wrote going over his own experiences with this issue: http://y.tsutsumi.io/keyerror-in-self_handlers-a-journey-deep-into-tornados-internals.html
At the very least it would be nice to have some documentation suggesting that you run IOLoop.clear_instance() and IOLoop.clear_current() after a fork()
