When attempting to make a copy (through a deepcopy of a container), the following exception is raised:
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'status_code'
Perhaps a simple copy and deepcopy implementation would be appropriate? If so, let me know and I can give a pull request a stab. If it's not appropriate, I can try to find a workaround.
