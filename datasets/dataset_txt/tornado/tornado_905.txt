I'm upgrading my app from Tornado 2.4.1 to 3.1. Everything's pretty smooth, with one caveat (and I didn't see this listed in the release notes anywhere):
In web.call, it looks like @bdarnell changed the default behavior of escape.url_unescape to pass plus=False along (see 917fe80). I understand that this is technically correct behavior according to spec. But it broke some of my tests, which means this is a backwards-incompatible change. Obviously I was relying on incorrect behavior, but I wanted to raise attention to this.
I can change my app without too much trouble. That being said, if @bdarnell wants to retain old behavior from Tornado < 3.1, then a fix may be required here. What do you think, Ben?
