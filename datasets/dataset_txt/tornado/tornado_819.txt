Many methods of WebSocketHandler are disallowed; now that applications can cleanly intercept the pre-websocket phase of the request in prepare(), we should allow these methods at that time (and then they would become disallowed once the websocket handshake has begun). This would allow applications to return HTTP error responses (e.g. for authentication failures).
