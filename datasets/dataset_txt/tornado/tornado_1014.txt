THe docstring to stop() says "Stop the loop after the current event loop iteration is complete." But PollIOLoop.stop() aborts the eventloop mid flight before any polling happens. This makes it impossible to do the following to have the loop do a single iteration as no IO is done:
loop.add_timeout(0, loop.stop)
loop.start()
I submitted this for pyzmq which copied the eventloop and was asked to submit it here:.
zeromq/pyzmq#297
If this is not the right solution, how can I run a single iteration of the loop?
