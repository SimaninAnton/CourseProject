Reported by Stefan Scholl on the mailing list:
I've just seen that tornado.escape.xhtml_escape (used as "escape" in
the templates) only escapes "&", "<", and ">". It uses escape from
xml.sax.saxutils.
Used in an attribute, ' and " should be escaped, too.
But don't convert ' to ', because this is XML only and can be a
problem with HTML and visitors using Internet Explorer. ' should be
converted to '.
