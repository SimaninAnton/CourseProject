I run Chrome dev channel, which has updated its websocket version, breaking compatibility with tornado websockets.

Which suggests Sec-WebSocket-Version is now 13, but Wikipedia suggests Chromium is using something called hybi 17, which may or may not be the same.
I imagine you guys are more familiar with what these things actually mean than I am.
