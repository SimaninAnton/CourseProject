As noted in a recent thread on the tornado list [0], the reloading of templates without a server restart is sometimes a requirement. While the "debug" setting provides reloading, it doesn't suit the needs of clients who request the ability to modify templates in the long term. The "reload_modified_templates" setting, seen in my branch [1], allows for this at a slight loss of speed. As I noted in the thread, "Running "ab -n 100000 -c 25 http://10.0.1.x/" from a separate machine resulted in 2465.15 rps without my patch and 2343.14 rps with."
