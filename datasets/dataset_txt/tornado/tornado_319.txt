Hello there. I'm opening this issue because I'm currently trying to keep the html file's indentation with no success. It's not a bug, it's not even a problem. The reason to keep the indentation is quite simple I'm embedding python code inside html thanks to Brython library, and since Python needs indentation i am receiving "IndentationError: expected an indented block".
The workaround can be quite simple as defining a new argument such as i.e. self.render('index.html', identation=True).
Can someone give me some tip, or help to allow me to use Brython/Python ?
