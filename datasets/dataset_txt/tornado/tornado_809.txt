When an incorrect HTTP request is performed, tornado makes no reply (log + return in code). I suggest returning an 400 error code.
For example, when working behind an nginx proxy-server, it causes a 502 error code to the end-user and a record in nginx's error log, which is incorrect (should be 400 and a warning).
