so my code looks something like this:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
    http_server.listen(8000)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
Sometimes I leave another django or tornado app running already on port 8000 which I soon discover when I try to actually access the site.
It would be nice if http_server or the instance().start() could raise an error if the port is already taken.
