The demos/chatdemo/chatdemo.py from commit 5c7d6d3 works.
After that, it doesn't work on my environment (fedora 20, python 2.7.5 or 3.3.2) but gives this message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "chatdemo.py", line 119, in <module>
    class AuthLoginHandler(BaseHandler, tornado.auth.GoogleMixin):
  File "chatdemo.py", line 120, in AuthLoginHandler
    @gen.coroutine
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'coroutine'
(Line numbers are from master branch (c9af9a7 is the latest touch to chatdemo.py). On 974c229, what shows as line 120 in the stack above is 121.)
