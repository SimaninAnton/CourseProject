If my RequestHandler attempts to write JSON object that the json serializer can't handle, an exception is thrown.
Normally, an argument "default" can be passed over to the json serializer, that would be able to handle these sort of object (ie: datetime objects), however, there's no way to pass this argument when using the write method from an overridden RequestHandler.
While I can json-serialize my own objects, and set the Content-Type header myself, part of the functionality of tornado is lost by doing so, and I end up with slightly duplicate code.
There are, a few relatively simple solutions that can fix this, however, IMO, being able to pass a default function as a setting to tornado is the cleanest of them all; it slightly enhances tornado, and simplifies these sort of (rather common) scenarios.
