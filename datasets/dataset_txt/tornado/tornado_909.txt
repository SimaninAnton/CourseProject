Imagine we're enumerating millions of records and we need to schedule processing for each of them via futures.
Rather than accumulating futures and therefore waiting unless enumuration ends (which itself uses futures) it should be possible to add future to the loop inplace.
Right now, the dirty hack is to call IOLoop().current().add_future(future, _empty_future_callback). where empty future callback does nothing. add_future should allow (and default to) None callback.
