If multiple cores are used, PeriodicCallback seems to get excecuted on each and every core.
So on my 8 core server _ mycronfunc_ was called eight times, though it's supposed to run only once (on any core).
server = HTTPServer(app)
server.bind(9999)
server.start(0)  # Forks multiple sub-processes 0 = use all cores
interval_ms = 30 * 1000
PeriodicCallback(mycronfunc, interval_ms).start()
IOLoop.instance().start()
