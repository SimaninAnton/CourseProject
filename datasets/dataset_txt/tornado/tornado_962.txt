Would a patch adding support for the request header Range: bytes=â€¦ and the response header Accept-Ranges: bytes to the web.StaticFileHandler be considered?
I'm working on a project which uses the StaticFileHandler to serve audio that is used with the HTML5 <audio> tag, which only supports seeking when the Accept-Ranges: bytes header is included.
