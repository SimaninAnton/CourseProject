The fix to #836 is inadequate.
As in my suggested patch, the "callback" variable needs to be cleared in addition to "callbacks". In Python, loop iteration variables like "callback" continue to hold the value of the last iteration even after the loop ends, so even after this fix the most recently executed callback will still be prevented from being garbage collected until another callback is received.
