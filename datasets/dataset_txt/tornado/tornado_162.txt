I know it's not really huge bug and I know it's not a critical issue.
But it bothers me anyway.
In file demos/websocket/static/chat.js line 36 should be changed from:
form.find("input[type=text]").val("").select();
to:
$("#message").val("").select();
in order to really clear input and set focus on it.
