I am experiencing the closing of a websocket when an exception occurs in a handler. This happens in two cases:
The handler is called by WebSocketHandler.on_message.
The handler is invoked via ioloop.call_later.
As far as I remember, the behavior on an exception in a handler was to report the error, without any further action such as closing the websocket. I find the case where the websocket is closed after an exception in a handler invoked via call_later particularly surprising.
Context (a hacky workaround): flexxui/flexx#163
Let me know if you want me to try to create a simple example that demonstrates this issue.
