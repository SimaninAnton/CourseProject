Recently, we discovered one of our site's third-party tools was injecting invalid cookies. This broke all form submissions for affected users, because of the xsrf cookie. They shouldn't be injecting invalid cookies, of course, but I imagine this must be a not-uncommon issue, since bugs do happen.
Is there a fix for this at the framework-level that would make sense? If so, I'm happy to attempt a PR.
One solution, for example, could be to reset all cookies if they fail to parse. That won't help the current request, of course, but at least future requests would have a clean slate to work with. It would've solved our problems at least, since the tool was only injecting invalid cookies sporadically.
