our project is using python as serverside, and import tornado for connection manager.
as we found and reported, when totally 1000+ clients connected on server, it may trigger issue:
lots of websocket connections are closed at the same time. clients all offline....
clients detect it and re-connection... and re-offline ....
it lasts for about 10-15 minutes, then recovered..
i've no idea how this triggered?
and it becomes more frequently after we use https and wss.
any suggestions?
many thanks!!!!!
