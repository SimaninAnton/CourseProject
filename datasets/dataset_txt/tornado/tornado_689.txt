I recent try the django-rest-framework, some of its features is really awsome for making restful-api-application.
as example, the seriliazers as a form-validate, a serials of renderers to change the output during to the requests header or request path suffix.
and what I like most is the viewset. use list/retrieve/update/create/delete for resource method, but not get/post/put/delete. I even not need to define two requestHandler for one resource.
does there any plan about this? I really recommend.
