Why is there set_close_exec function in bind_sockets()?
In multi-process http server in tornado, the exec does not be called after os.fork(), so it is no need to call set_close_exec to close the fd opened in parent process after child processes start. And the sockets are be used in child process to handle request.
So what is the reason to call set_close_exec() after socket.socket()?
Thanks !!
