Futures from the concurrent.futures package are not awaitable. Until that package is updated, an adapter function is needed. convert_yielded is usually recommended as the adapter for this scenario, but as a special optimization, it passes concurrent futures through unmodified. Perhaps this optimization should be removed, and concurrent futures should be wrapped just like asyncio futures.
As an interim solution, tornado.platform.asyncio.to_tornado_future works in this case even though it was only intended to accept asyncio futures.
