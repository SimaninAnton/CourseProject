At the moment Tornado forbids writing JSON lists due to a potential cross-site vulnerability explained in an article from 2008.
Note, however, that vulnerability is now 8 years old (first records I find on it are from 2006), and in the 2008 article it only affected Firefox <= 2.0 (not even IE6!), which ended security support the same year.
Does it make sense for us to maintain this kind of limitation because of an ancient vulnerability in browsers that has been fixed 6 years ago?
