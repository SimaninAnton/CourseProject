Short:
text/event-stream should be added to the set of applicable content-types in:
tornado.web.GZipContentEncoding.CONTENT_TYPES
Long:
Currently, tornado does not allow gzip-compression for Server-Sent Events.
The standardized (http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) protocol is based on plain text and uses the MIME type text/event-stream. Since it is implemented using plain text and often json, those HTTP streams would benefit from compression.
But gzip compression in tornado is only applied to a set of white-listed text-like MIME types. And the text/event-stream type is missing.
