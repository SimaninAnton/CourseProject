This is more like a question, I am sorry if this isn't the right place to address it.
Is there any way to get the asyncio.as_completed behavior but for Tornado coroutines?
What I am trying to do is the following: let's assume I have some coroutines that make some network calls to various endpoints and there is no way to know in what order they will finish and I don't want to wait for each call to complete before initiating the next call.
The current solution would be by yielding for each coroutine in some order.
for running_coro in [make_network_call(url) for url in urls]:
    result = yield running_coro
    # do something with the result
I would like to do something like this
for completed_coro in as_completed([make_network_call(url) for url in urls]):
    result = yield completed_coro
    # do something with the result
Thank you in advance!
