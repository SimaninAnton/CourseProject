I'd like to set SO_REUSEPORT on a binded socket to have more fair load balancing in case of a multiple process setup. Right now I have to copy bind_sockets implementation and add couple of strigns. What if we add an optional parametr (tuple of socket options) to bind_socket to set the options after socket.socket(...)?
