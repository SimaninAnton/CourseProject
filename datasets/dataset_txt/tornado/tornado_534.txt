Dear,
I used a packae using Tornado for I/O.
https://dato.com/learn/gallery/notebooks/intro-regression.html
However, afer running function , the output Tornado seems closed...
File "\Anaconda2\envs\dato-env\lib\site-packages\zmq\eventloop\zmqstream.py", line 492, in _check_closed
raise IOError("Stream is closed")
IOError: Stream is closed
ERROR:tornado.application:Exception in callback <functools.partial object at 0x0000000025716E58>
Traceback (most recent call last):
How can I enable back the stream in the script and see the output in IPython ?
Thanks
