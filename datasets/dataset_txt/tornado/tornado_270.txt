When the loop is closed, add_callback returns quietly in PollIOLoop but raises RuntimeError in AsyncIOLoop. I don't have an opinion on what the best behavior is (I do find the RuntimeError mildly irritating, especially as you can't easily inspect the loop to know whether it is closed already -- perhaps add a is_closed() method? :-)), but IMHO it would be better if the two were consistent with each other.
