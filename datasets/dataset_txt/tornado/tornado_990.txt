When using RequestHandler.set_cookie to set an expiring cookie, Tornado formats that expires datetime value the way it is used in HTTP. It must be formatted the way Netscape did it, with hyphens between day, month and year, not spaces.
Instead of 
'Set-Cookie': 'foo=bar; expires=Sat, 14 Jul 2012 08:33:00 GMT; Path=/'
it must be
'Set-Cookie': 'foo=bar; expires=Sat, 14-Jul-2012 08:33:00 GMT; Path=/'
Expires never became a standard and should get replaced by Max-Age, although it is still widely used.
