If I upload a file with a semicolon (;) ["my;file.pdf"], Tornado
crashes
File "tornado\wsgi.py", line 172, in _parse_mime_body
name, name_value = name_part.strip().split("=", 1)
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
Semicolon in filename is most of the time nerver well handled in
python (don't know why it is not fixed... or maybe I don't know how it
works) and we "often' get : "my" instead of "my;file.pdf".
