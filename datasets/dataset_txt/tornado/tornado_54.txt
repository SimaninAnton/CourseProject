Hi Everyone,
I'm fairly new to Tornado and I'm sorting through issues to contribute to and thought it would be helpful to have the labels "feature_request" and "beginner_friendly" added to the available labels for the issues.
Granted this isn't 'critical' by any means but could help newbies like me find things they're interested in contributing to.
