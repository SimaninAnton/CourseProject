I would like to know your thoughts on adding a new feature to allow expressions in templates fail silently.
Many times we get a 500 error in production because an expression ({{ some expression }}) in a template raises an exception caused by data that change dynamically. In most cases we could render the template with an empty string where the expression raised but don't want to mess up the template with many if/try statements.
The idea is to be able to render a page in production to the client even if some data is not like expected, instead of giving a 500 error.
It also would be interesting to enable/disable this functionality based on the environment: production/development/debug.
