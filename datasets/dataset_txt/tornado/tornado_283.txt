I have a tornado websocket server handling about 80 websocket connections. It seems tornado is not properly handling stale/closed connections. After a while lots of connections end up in tcp CLOSE_WAIT state.
This eventually seems to lead to lots of TCP listen overflows, and the server being completely frozen. Although I'm not completely sure if the TCP overflows and hanging server are related to the CLOSE_WAIT, it does seem to be the case.
Any idea on what might be causing the issue, and how it might be resolved?
