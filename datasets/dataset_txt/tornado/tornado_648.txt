Hi,
While attempting to use the tornado.escape.xhtml_unescape function to decode data encoded externally I noticed that the function would fail to decode if the encoded string contained a numeric character specified in hex. I.e. unescaping '&#32;' works OK, but '&#x20;' doesn't.
I have a fix for this in escape.py and could generate a pull request if you would like to take a look.
Thanks,
Steve Zweep
