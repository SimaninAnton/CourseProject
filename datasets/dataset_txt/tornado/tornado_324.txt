Typical symptom is the following:
tornado.application - ERROR - Exception in callback None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/antoine/miniconda3/envs/dask27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado/ioloop.py", line 886, in start
    fd_obj, handler_func = self._handlers[fd]
This happens whenever a IO handler calls IOStream.close(), while another event is pending on that IOStream's socket. IOStream.close() removes and closes the socket immediately and, when the queued event is processed by the IOLoop, it can't find the relevant handler in its internal table.
