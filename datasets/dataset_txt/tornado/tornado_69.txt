It looks like when I do a pip install tornado for python 2.7, the code added to site-packages/ looks like it is python 3.5 and not compatible with 2.7. Not sure if there is another reason going on, but rolling back to an older tornado version fixes the issue, so I think either the wrong code was pushed to pypi or something snuck in that isn't python2.7 compatible with the 2.7 repository.
