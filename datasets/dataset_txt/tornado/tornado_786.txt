I'm sure that I'm missing something here, but I don't understand why the exceptions in a coroutine are getting swallowed, and I keep getting bit by this.
Gist of sample program that demonstrates an exception being swallowed (see exception_gets_lost() ) : https://gist.github.com/virtuald/96882b5d3724c70fe3a1
I feel like this is a bug -- but I also feel like I may be missing something. At the very least, it's very unexpected behavior, and I feel like the 'unhandled exception handler' in ioloop should be logging it, but it doesn't. What am I missing here?
