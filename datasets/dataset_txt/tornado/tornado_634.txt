I'm trying to make a https request like this using AsyncHTTPClient:
request = HTTPRequest('https://some_ip_address/2',
        headers={'Host': 'xxx.appspot.com'},
        ssl_options=ssl_context)
It failed with an ssl.CertificateError saying that the hostnames don't match. This is because the ssl connection assumes that the hostname to match is some_ip_address. If the server_hostname parameter of IOStream.start_tls() is also set to xxx.appspot.com then it works fine. However, this parameter is not exposed and I can find no way to work around it. So, should this parameter be added to the interface or am I missing something?
