I have a python server running on my raspberry pi 3 B+ model.
It's running fine and everything works in html when I connect to it through my local ip with the correct port and shows button presses etc...
This is the server code:

I want to connect to the python server with a C# client. (it will connect from the Unity game engine but not sure if this even matters).
Options I've checked:
NET +4.5 websockets (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.websockets.websocket?view=netframework-4.6)
https://github.com/jirihybek/unity-websocket-webgl
I think the most basic and straightforward way would be using the .NET websockets built into it right? Unity uses it too so might be easier?
I really hope someone can help! I'm sure there's more people out there trying to connect to Tornado with a C# client but information is incredibly sparse about this subject.
