Hi,
I'm getting a weird KeyError exception and I don't know exactly why is produced. This was produced when sending a POST request to a HTTP server, using the method http_fetch from HTTPClient.
Check https://github.com/mogelbrod/TweetRank/blob/master/crawler/RankerNotifier.py to see how the requests are sent.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado/curl_httpclient.py", line >95, in _handle_socket
self.io_loop.remove_handler(fd)

events = self._active.pop(fd)
KeyError: 6
Why is this Exception raised? What should I do to solve this problem?
Thank you very much!
