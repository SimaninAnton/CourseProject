With Python 2.7.8 and Tornado 4.0.1 on Linux, I get the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "notifyd.py", line 224, in <module>
    notifyd.run()
  File "notifyd.py", line 203, in run

    sockets = bind_sockets(port, address=address)

    return uname()[0]

    processor = _syscmd_uname('-p','')

    rc = f.close()
IOError: [Errno 10] No child processes
Looking at the commit logs, I can trace the cause of this regression to this commit:
a6e83a6
Reverting this commit fixes the problem... but that doesn't solve the original problem the commit tried to fix.
Note, Python 3.4 does not have this problem.
