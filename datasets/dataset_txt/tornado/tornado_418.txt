Let's suppose I want to add a custom parameter to a websockethandler like this:
class WebSocket(tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler):
    def initialize(self, appserver, **kwargs):
        self.appserver = appserver
        super().initialize(**kwargs)
The handler is added to the server with this handler argument:
        (r"/websocket", WebSocket, dict(appserver=self.appserver))
The problem is that super().initialize(**kwargs) call fails because tornado.web.RequestHandler.initialize does not have keyword arguments (formally). Although its documentations says specifically that "A dictionary passed as the third argument of a url spec will be supplied as keyword arguments to initialize()."
Summary: cannot use multiple inheritance with RequestHandler.initialize()
Suggested fix: add *args and **kwargs to RequestHandler.initialize()
