My question is related to the issue #325.
I am sending a POST request to my server as follows :
import urllib
url = 'http://localhost:8888/'
params = urllib.urlencode({'uid':uid,'to':['rd','sg']})
response = urllib.urlopen(url,params)
the_page = response.read()
Note that I am trying to pass a list of strings via 'to' argument.
On my server side, I am trying to read back the list of strings as follows :
class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
def post(self,resource=None):
uid = self.get_argument('uid') #this is fine
    #the below call returns an unicode string ["['rd', 'sg']"]
    to_list = self.get_argument['to'] 
I could not get the original list from "to_list" [i tried pickling, json dumping etc].
Basically, every POST argument is converted into a list and if the client passes a list of objects as one of the parameters, I am not able to retrieve the original list back on the server side.
Quick suggestion will help me! Thanks.
