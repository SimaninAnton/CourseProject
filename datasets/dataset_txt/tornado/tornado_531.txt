self.redirect ("/a/b") this is the client to jump, that is, the URL bar shows the jump after the URL
How to carry out the server segment to jump it similar to servlet Java (redirect, forward) inside the forward, the server side after the jump, the client address bar does not need to change, show or jump before the URL
