tokens = await IOLoop.current().run_on_executor(None, self._get_alltokens)
AttributeError: 'AsyncIOMainLoop' object has no attribute 'run_on_executor'
Python: Python 3.6.8
Tornado: 6.0.3
I am not sure what I am doing wrong, I've gone over multiple examples and the syntax seems to be the same. Any help regarding this is greatly appreciated.
