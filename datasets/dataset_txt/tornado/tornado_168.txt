Am getting ResourceWarning errors on tornado, especially when using websockets
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tornado/gen.py:1154: ResourceWarning: unclosed <socket.socket fd=120, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, laddr=('0.0.0.0', 0)> self.future, inner)
This interferes with debugging actual errors as the socket is sending data to client side in a loop, so every time it does a socket.write_message(), a resource warning is emitted, so its kinda hard to notice any bugs as the terminal is filled with ResourceWarning emissions
I tried disabling this warnings using the warning module to no avail, also I tried to disable from the commandline as
python3 -W ignore server.py
still doesnt work....
Kindly Help,
Thanks.
