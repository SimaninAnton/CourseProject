The release notes are not clear which versions are vulnerable for the cookie parser security fix.
quote: (older versions of Tornado would reject the entire header for a single invalid cookie)
Does that infer that only previous 4.4 releases were vulnerable? What about 4.2 and 4.3 releases, are any of those vulnerable? older...?
As a package maintainer, but not a tornado coder, I need to know the extent of the vulnerability. If I need to fastrack stabilization of the 4.4.2 release and remove which older versions, etc...
