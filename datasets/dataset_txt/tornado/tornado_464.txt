Using tornado to work against a remote API to grab a bunch of API calls. Every 40-100 URLs I get a spool of these, and I'd love to just re-add them to my backlog and continue forward.

My questions are, now can I avoid this, and is there a way to recover from this and re-run those URLs through?
Here's an example of the code I'm using. :)
