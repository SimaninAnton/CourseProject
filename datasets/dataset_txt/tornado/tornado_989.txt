Hi, i try to run the blog demo, but got some srange output from _ function.
{{ _('<a href="%(url)s">Sign in</a> to compose/edit') % {"url": "/auth/login?next=" + url_escape(request.uri)} }}
After the translate, the a tag and other entities were escaped.Is this a bug, or it is the duty for the developer use js to render it correctly?
