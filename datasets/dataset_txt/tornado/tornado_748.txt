In a handler decorated with stream_request_body, raising an HTTPError interrupts the connection to the client rather than returning the expected error response. For example:
@web.stream_request_body
class MyHandler(web.RequestHandler):
    def put(self):
        raise web.HTTPError(400)
I would like the client to receive an error response with a code of 400, but instead it gets a broken pipe error. Is this expected? Is there a way to return a normal HTTP error in this case?
