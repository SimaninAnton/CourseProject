The website says:
you need to have PycURL (version 7.18.2 or higher)
however, the README file says:
sudo easy_install setuptools pycurl==7.16.2.1 simplejson
running 7.16.2 with tornado 1.1 causes an endless loop error b/c pycurl.SOCKET_TIMEOUT does not exist. tornado falls into an endless loop.
Using the package on the site, and not in the readme resolves this
sudo easy_install -U setuptools pycurl==7.18.2
