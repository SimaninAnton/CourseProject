Hi,
I'm having a question regarding passing an additional query parameter along with 'next' during login in order to load the page based on the user logging in.
For ex:
If a user 'A' is getting into an application and page1.html is loaded for him, then he is navigating to page2.html, suppose if the session is expired, he will be redirected to login page and after logging in, he will be redirected to page2.html using next parameter.
Now, after session expiry, if user 'B' is trying to logging in, he is being redirected to page2.html directly because of the 'next' parameter.
So, is there any option available to pass an additional query parameter along with 'next' parameter in login url ?
