Running the Facebook Demo gives "Invalid App ID: 9e2ada1b462142c4dfcc8e894ea1e37c". Attempted from Chrome and Firefox by accessing http://localhost:8888/ as directed by the README.
Update: It is just the facebook_api_key and facebook_secret values which are invalid. I created a new facebook app and put my keys in the demo code and it works correctly.
