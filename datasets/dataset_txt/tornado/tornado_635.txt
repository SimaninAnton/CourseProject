I was testing some OAuth related code that sets a login cookie and redirects to the root of the application. I believe that _HTTPConnection.finish should be copying the Set-Cookie header from the redirect response (e.g., self.headers) into new_request. I will put together a pull request for this some time tonight. If I am missing something, let me know.
Oh... and keep up the good work ;)
