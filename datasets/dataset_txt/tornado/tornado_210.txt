about httpclient.HTTPClient()
I can't execute http_client = httpclient.HTTPClient() in tornado==5.0
running this will throw Exception this：
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Users/zhonghao/anaconda3/envs/tornado_test/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 85, in del
self.close()
File "/Users/zhonghao/anaconda3/envs/tornado_test/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 89, in close
if not self._closed:
AttributeError: 'HTTPClient' object has no attribute '_closed'
but in tornado==4.5.2
it works fine, this issue on macOS，can you tell me why？
