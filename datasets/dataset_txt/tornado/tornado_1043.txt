On my synology with Python 2.7 tornado fails to startup. There's no epoll support in the kernel of the synology.
I did a quick hack in ioloop and changed
if hasattr(select, "epoll"):
# Python 2.6+ on Linux
_poll = select.epoll
elif hasattr(select, "kqueue"):
into
if hasattr(select, "kqueue"):
maybe you can come up with a more elegant/ permanent fix.
