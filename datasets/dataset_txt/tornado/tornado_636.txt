Invalid HTTP responses are causing the following exception to get thrown and not caught:
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/curl_httpclient.py", line 467, in _curl_header_callback
    headers.parse_line(header_line)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/httputil.py", line 189, in parse_line
    name, value = line.split(":", 1)
As far as I can tell when this happens the response callback never gets called.
