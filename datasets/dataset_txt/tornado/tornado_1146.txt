Using javascript templates is tricky because it often requires you to use similar syntax to Tornado templates. While you can use the {{! and {{% syntax, this is often pretty cumbersome for large chunks of javascript templates. I propose we have a verbatim/raw/cdata keyword that would output my template code unchanged.
