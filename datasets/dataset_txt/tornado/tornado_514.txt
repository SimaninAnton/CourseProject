I know this has been asked before here but I think the answer was too concise. The question is mainly how to use a custom StaticFileHandler. The response was:
This is a bit tricky; you need to subclass StaticFileHandler and override its write_error method, then install that class with static_handler_class Application setting.
Following the instructions, I have this (based on this other example):
class MyFileHandler(tornado.web.StaticFileHandler):
    def write_error(self, status_code, **kwargs):
        if status_code == 404:
            self.redirect('http://example.com') # Fetching a default resource
and in my Application class:
handlers = [
        (r'/', IndexHandler),
        (r'/static/(.*)', MyFileHandler, {'path': 'path/to/my/resources'}),
]
Surprisingly, this works. But I didn't "install that class with static_handler_class". There is not much information available about static_handler_class. Would you be able to provide more details?
Thank you
