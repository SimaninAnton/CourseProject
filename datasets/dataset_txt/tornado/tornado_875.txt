Not sure if it's a bug or a feature, but currently StaticFileHandler disallows dynamic routing to favicon.ico and robots.txt.
It registers handlers for "/(favicon\.ico)" and r"/(robots\.txt)" in init method, so an application with StaticFileHandler enabled cannot override those URLs with custom handlers without subclassing StaticFileHandler.
It's a question of design: should a handler for static files by default take exclusive responsibility for these exceptional URLs, or should it make it optional/configurable?
