What I would like to be able to do is implement some function that is able to do some operation regardless of what thread it's on.
if IOLoop.has_ioloop():
    # do some async thing here
else:
   IOLoop.instance().add_callback( async_thing_here )
The semantics of IOLoop.current() don't meet this, because it will always return something if an IOLoop has been initialized somewhere.
