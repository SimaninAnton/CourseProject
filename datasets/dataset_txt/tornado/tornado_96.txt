Hi All, I am trying to install tornado 5.1.1 on Redhat Linux x86/64.
Python3 was manually compiled and installed without issues along with many other packages.
Tornado depends of SSL module, which was written for (?) Python2.
I fixed manually one issue in SSL, but still:
pip3 install jupyter --no-index --find-links=file:///${HOME}/work/py36whl/
Looking in links: file:///${HOME}/work/py36whl/
Collecting jupyter
Collecting notebook (from jupyter)
Collecting ipywidgets (from jupyter)
Collecting qtconsole (from jupyter)
Collecting jupyter-console (from jupyter)
Collecting nbconvert (from jupyter)
Collecting ipykernel (from jupyter)
Collecting prometheus-client (from notebook->jupyter)
Collecting Send2Trash (from notebook->jupyter)
Collecting nbformat (from notebook->jupyter)
Collecting traitlets>=4.2.1 (from notebook->jupyter)
Collecting tornado>=4 (from notebook->jupyter)
Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/tmp/pip-install-y8kh14v4/tornado/setup.py", line 18, in
import ssl
File "....../lib/python3.6/ssl.py", line 101, in
import _ssl # if we can't import it, let the error propagate
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ssl'
----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-install-y8kh14v4/tornado/
Is it possible to avoid outdated SSL module?
