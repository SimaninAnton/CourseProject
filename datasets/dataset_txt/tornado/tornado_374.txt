I am using tornado 4.1 above gives error. Traceback:
Future <tornado.concurrent.Future object at 0x104e7d2e8> exception was never retrieved: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 215, in wrapper
result = func(*args, **kwargs)
TypeError: _execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'transforms
What could be the possible reason behind it ?
