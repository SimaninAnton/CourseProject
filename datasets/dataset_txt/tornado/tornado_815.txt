In response to #189 the commit 84c5ddb was made. But it didn't completely solve the issue.
Previously both past and future cookies were compared against the magic number 31 (days). In the above commit the max_age parameter was added and used only for the past cookie check.
It should also be used when checking future cookie expiration. Or another parameter is needed.
