I want to know to which IP address is the hostname resolved to in Tornado when using AsyncHTTPClient using python.
ip_address = await tornado.netutil.Resolver.resolve(hostname)
print("IP ADDRESS Resolver: {}".format(ip_address))
I need to know the IP address of the server machine to which the hostname is resolved to.
Please guide and correct me where I'm wrong...
