I can't creat multi-proceccing service with tornado in which my request handler loads shared library (so lib)ã€‚problem show infomation as following and keep staying there.
WARNING:tornado.general:child 1 (pid 38338) killed by signal 11, restarting
I have tried in two ways, but both come with the problem as described before.
sockets = tornado.netutil.bind_sockets(8890)
tornado.process.fork_processes(0)
server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(app)
server.add_sockets(sockets)
tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
and the second
app = tornado.web.Application(handlers=[
(r"/nlu", NluHandler),
], autoreload=False, debug=False)
http_server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(app)
http_server.bind(8890)
http_server.start(2)
tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
