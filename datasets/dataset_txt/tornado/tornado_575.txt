Not an issue, but Request to Improve
While I love Python and Tornado, specifically for its coroutine decorator based coding style, which lets me write clean and readable code, I mostly have to fallback to other framework in later phases.
Why - because my projects just does not depend on Tornado, but other programs like Database, Caching etc.
For example, NodeJS, has mature and many vendor supported libraries, Tornado lacks in this. Take Redis, Cassandra etc. Redis library works fine, as expected on Nodejs, tornado-redis just has a lots of problems, gave me a headache with a basic issue and is not actively maintained. Cassandra has few examples of async query, none native to Tornado.
What can we do, to improve the developers ecosystem around Tornado, so they can actively contribute and introduce new libraries.
Other way I can see, is to support AsyncIO loops (which now is in Tornado), and then their libraries can be used without any issues in Tornado.
