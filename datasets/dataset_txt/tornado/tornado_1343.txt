Hi,
I believe that I encounter a bug when try to create an instanace of httpserver.HTTPRequest.
In the constructor of httpserver.HTTPRequest, I think this line
self.host = host or headers.get("Host") or "127.0.0.1"
should probably mean
self.host = host or self.headers.get("Host") or "127.0.0.1"
Otherwise, creating an HTTPReqeust instance without giving headers will die here.
Thanks,
Victor
