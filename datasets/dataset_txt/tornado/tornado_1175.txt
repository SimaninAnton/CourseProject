It would be nice if Tornado allowed to disable CSRF protection for the duration of a single request. Currently it can only be achieved by overriding the RequestHandler._execute().
It can be achieved by allowing subclasses of the RequestHandler to override xsrf_protection(), which in turn, by default, would return the value of xsrf_cookies setting.
class RequestHandler(object):
    def xsrf_protection(self):
        return self.application.settings.get("xsrf_cookies")
...
And in the _execute method:
if self.request.method not in ("GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS") and self.xsrf_protection():
    self.check_xsrf_cookie()
What do you think?
