I noticed in the demonstrations of IOStream a blocking sock.connect() call is used before the socket is made non-blocking and added to the IOLoop: http://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/iostream.py#L46
It would be fairly simply to add non-blocking connect_ex support, and _handle_connect to the IOStream. I've done this in my own code. Is this a planned feature?
