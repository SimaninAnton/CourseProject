It appears that RequestHandler.send_error calls self.clear() explicitly which removes all previously added HTTP headers. This causes issues when someone wants to issue a 503 with the optional "Retry-After" header as it simply strips out the header.
I'm not aware of any particular need for clear() to be called so would it be possible to just remove this call?
