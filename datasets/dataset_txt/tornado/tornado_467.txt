The chat and websocket demo apps use the jquery live() method, which was removed in jquery 1.9. The demos still work if used as-is because they load jquery 1.3 (which was the current version when the chat demo was first written), but they're now less useful as examples. Both demos should be updated to work with up-to-date dependencies.
