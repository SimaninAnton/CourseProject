Hello,
I was recently using the @AddSlash decorator, and I noticed that it is implemented using self.redirect, which does a 302 Found redirect. I think it would be better to use a 301 Moved Permanently redirect, as the presence of the decorator indicates that the canonical location should be the one with the trailing slash. @removeslash should probably be the same.
Thoughts?
