If I create a tornado Subprocess and wait for it to exit, I get this error:
ERROR:tornado.application:Future exception was never retrieved: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\tornado\gen.py", line 230, in wrapper

File "C:\test.py",
yield proc.wait_for_exit()

signal.SIGCHLD,
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'SIGCHLD'
So I guess Windows does not have SIGCHLD. Does this mean wait_for_exit is not supported on Windows?
