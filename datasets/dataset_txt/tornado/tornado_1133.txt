Hi!
I just came across some code that used get_secure_cookie("foo", None). Now that include_name has appeared as a third parameter:
def get_secure_cookie(self, name, include_name=True, value=None)
the meaning of this has changed from passing None as value to passing None to include_name, rendering it false and thus causing all new set_secure_cookies to not be accepted. Maybe it would be a good idea to exchange the order?
I don't quite understand the purpose of include_name anyway, it seems to me if you pass include_name=False, old cookies may still work but all new cookies will then fail. That seems a bit useless. Maybe I'm not reading the code properly.
