I want to collect data from query_arguments or body_arguments and validate them. But I have some doubts about RequestHandler .
When the data is invalid how to ignore get/post/etc method ( finish the request early ) and just return error message ?
How to give the valid data as the args to get/post/etc method
In the prepare method json.loads(self.request.body) can‘t run because the type of self.request.body is bytes not str . And I think this a bug in python3.
