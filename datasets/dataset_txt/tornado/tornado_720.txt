Hi, Tornado has a xheaders setting that is great for requests passed over by nginx. But there are others that do such reverse proxying too, e.g. CloudFlare uses both X-Forwarded-For (which will be the last but one behind nginx) and Cf-Connecting-IP (which Tornado does not handle, and it's necessary to check the request is from CloudFlare). I think it'll be great if Tornado provides a way to customize this.
