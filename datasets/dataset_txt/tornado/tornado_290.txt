Currently the only option to have working proxy support is to use the CurlAsyncHTTPClient together with the proxy_host and proxy_port args. Unfortunately the way this is implemented is flawed which results in not working HTTPs Proxy support (using HTTP Connect). The curl library wants the option HTTPPROXYTUNNEL in that case.
The easiest way to fix this would be to simply remove this line as curl will then use the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy and will set the HTTPPROXYTUNNEL option if needed. As stated in #754 using the well known environment variables is the standard way to configure proxies and they should imho be honored by tornado as well.
