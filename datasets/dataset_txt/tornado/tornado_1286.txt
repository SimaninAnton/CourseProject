I have found two issues since I last cloned Tornado repository on Monday:
According to PEP 333 start_response(status, headers) function must return
a write(body_data) callable.
When WSGI app pass to start_response two Set-Cookie headers only last one
is send in response.
First issue is still there. Second one was already fixed.
To fix both of this issues I wrote HTTPWSGIServer class which might be used
instead of original HTTPServer. My code relies on webob.Request/Response objects.
If you are interested in it let me know.

PS. Is it possible to attach file to issue in Github?
