Hi,
This is a issue opened by Chris Lamb (https://alioth-lists.debian.net/pipermail/python-modules-team/2018-December/051712.html)
The line
copyright = "2009-%s, The Tornado Authors" % time.strftime("%Y")
on docs/conf.py will no be reproducible. So, in Debian packaging a patch was created to use SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable. This way we avoid the mentioned problem.
The patch is here
You can read more about SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH here. Please, consider support it.
