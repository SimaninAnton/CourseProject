I want to use Sourcegraph code search and code review with tornado. A project maintainer needs to enable it to set up a webhook so the code is up-to-date there.
Could you please enable tornado on @sourcegraph by going to https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tornadoweb/tornado and clicking on Settings? (It should only take 15 seconds.)
Thank you!
