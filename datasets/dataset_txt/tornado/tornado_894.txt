I am currently working on whiteboard app. I am implemented app using Websocket using Tornado framework. The app working on IE10, because it supports WS protocol. But I need to give the support for IE9. But IE9 didn't support WS protocol. So for support IE9 am using Flash socket policy(https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js).
But I got this error as shown below,
[WebSocket] cannot connect to Web Socket server at ws://localhost/realtime/ (SecurityError: Error #2048)
make sure the server is running and Flash socket policy file is correctly placed
Is there any builtin flash socket policy server ? Please help me. Thanks.
