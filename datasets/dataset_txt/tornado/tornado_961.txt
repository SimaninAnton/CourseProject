This gist https://gist.github.com/aglyzov/5585806 illustrates a bug (?) in Tornado 3.0.1.
Two things are needed for this bug to trigger:
HTTPS url
which is firewalled
In that case a Timeout exception generated in the simple_httpclient does not get caught in the calling coroutine which is then get hung up.
This particular URL in the example uses a bot-net protection cloud service which expects a client to set a User-Agent header (see the commented out line in the code).
Thus omitting the header triggers the bug.
