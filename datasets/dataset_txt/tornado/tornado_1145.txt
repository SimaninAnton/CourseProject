os.execv on windows is broken on windows when arguments contain spaces, and now it can't be fixed for fear of breaking workarounds people have built on top of it: http://bugs.python.org/issue436259
It looks like subprocess does the right thing here, so autoreload should probably just use subprocess (and then exit from the parent process) on platforms that don't have a working unix-style os.execv.
