It seems that when you make a HEAD request, the content (if any) is correctly not written to the response (https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/web.py#L892) while the Content-Length header is written (https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/web.py#L921) as if all content was present in the body.
Solution could be as easy as adding and self.request.method != "HEAD" to https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/web.py#L921
