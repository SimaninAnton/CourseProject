I am trying to override the render method in a Base RequestHandler, so I can add some variables to all templates. But I am having some strange errors for some variables, that I believe are reserved by Tornado. Am I correct? How can I get a list of these variables?
kwargs['xx'] = 42
return super(X, self).render(template_name, **kwargs)
{{ xx }} => prints 42

kwargs['authenticated'] = 42
return super(X, self).render(template_name, **kwargs)
{{ authenticated }} => error: undefined variable

kwargs['current_user'] = 42
return super(X, self).render(template_name, **kwargs)
{{ current_user }} => error: undefined variable
Thanks in advance
