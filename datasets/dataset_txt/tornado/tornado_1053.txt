In tornado/web.py : _handle_request_exception(), the call to self.send_error() doesn't pass along either the log_message or *args, such that those potential strings can be sent to the client (Specifically for sending additional data to a JSON-oriented client).
If I override write_error(), I can output a JSON formatted message, but I need to call send_error() directly in my RequestHandler, instead of just raising a HTTPError.
I can work up a patch if this is something that isn't distasteful in some way.
Thanks.
