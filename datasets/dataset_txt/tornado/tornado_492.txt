I'm using python2.7 and python3.5 and in both 422 is defined
https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html#httplib.responses
https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/http.client.html#http.client.responses
my code is doing
self.set_status(422)
self.finish({})
and it is returning
ValueError: ('unknown status code %d', 422)
However according to the doc it's supposed to be handled correctly:
http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/web.html#tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_status
status_code (int) â€“ Response status code. If reason is None, it must be present in httplib.responses.
