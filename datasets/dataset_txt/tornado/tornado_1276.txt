I was attempting to write my own authentication with tornado, but I have noticed that both POST and GET arguments come through with the same call, self.get_argument(). Maybe I'm a little overly paranoid, but I like my arguments to come in separately... in fact, it's highly recommended to never use a GET request to store information, yet someone could easily throw in a query string with whatever data they wanted.
I'm all fine for leaving self.get_argument(), but maybe there should be a built-in self.GET.get() and self.POST.get(), something like Django.
