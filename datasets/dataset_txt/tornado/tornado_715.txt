Since Python 2.7.9, the ssl module got backported from 3.4 and contains the needed functions:
Python 2.7.9 (default, Dec 11 2014, 04:42:00)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ssl
>>> hasattr(ssl, 'match_hostname') and hasattr(ssl, 'CertificateError')
True
So backports.ssl_match_hostname could be omitted from dependencies if python >=2.7.9, <3.0 were detected.
