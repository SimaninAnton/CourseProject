It seems strange to me that I can't prioritize command line options (if any) over a config file options in tornado.options.
One situation in which this feature could be handy is when I wish to specify a path to the config file as a command line option because this path may change depending on where my app starts (i.e. path to the config file is not a constant). Parsing command line options first, getting a full path to the config file from there and then parsing the config file doesn't do the trick in this case, because it will overwrite all other command line options if they are also defined in the config file.
