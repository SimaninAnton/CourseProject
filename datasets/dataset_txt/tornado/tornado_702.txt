SSL errors generally get logged as uncaught exceptions with a full stack trace (twice, in some cases: see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/python-tornado/catching$20sslerrors/python-tornado/MnNbTemU6ps/Z5ze8GEYXC8J). This is unnecessarily noisy; it would be better to treat at least some ssl errors (those which are clearly caused by the client) as less urgent and log a single-line warning (in some cases like an unclean connection shutdown we may not want to log anything at all).
