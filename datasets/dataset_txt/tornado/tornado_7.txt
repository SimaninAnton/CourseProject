I have a tornado websocket running in python3 which is working on a host system correctly but I have been unable to get it working when the server is running behind an L2/L3 forwarding device. I am using an nginx ingress controller with a load balancer that is serving the tornado secure websocket application.
Using tornado, is there a websocket parameter that can give an external port number to forward too; maybe similar to the autobahn python websocket implementation? I've been able to get working the autobahn external port correctly but the server app is now using tornado.
I've looked through the tornado docs but did not see anything relevant. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.
