Hello, I believe there is a performance issue with template render in version 2.0 as i see in this benchmark: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/blob/master/examples/bench.py
Results for tornado 1.2.1
                   Template Engine BigTable Benchmark                       
This benchmark compares some python templating engines with Jinja 2 so
that we get a picture of how fast Jinja 2 is for a semi real world
template.  If a template engine is not installed the test is skipped.
jinja               0.0113 seconds
mako                0.0120 seconds
tornado             0.0091 seconds
tenjin              *not installed*
spitfire            *not installed*
django              0.4031 seconds
genshi              *not installed*
cheetah             *not installed*
chameleon           *not installed*
chameleon_genshi    *not installed*
WARNING: The results of this benchmark are useless to compare the
performance of template engines and should not be taken seriously in any
way.  It's testing the performance of simple loops and has no real-world
usefulnes.  It only used to check if changes on the Jinja code affect
performance in a good or bad way and how it roughly compares to others.

It's a big diference between 1.2.1 and 2.0 (~ 6.8x)
