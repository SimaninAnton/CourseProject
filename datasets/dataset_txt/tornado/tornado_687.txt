Hello, although I'm not so sure if this is a bug, but I have ran into this problem recently.
Sometimes I build multi-part request with Content-Disposition header using modern http code library, the "filename" param may be missing, in this case, tornado will ignore it entirely.
I checked HTTP 1.1 RFC, but I'm not so sure if we could ignore this "filename" param.
Hope you can understand what I'm talking about. Thank you.
