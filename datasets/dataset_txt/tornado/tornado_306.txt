Hello, everyone.
I'm a little confused. When I try to refresh web pages, after post one form, I have to wait for a long time, what's the reason? However, even for a long time, there is still no refresh. So, I try to press CTRL + C, after this, it seems everything goes well.(Tornado Ver: 4.5.1, Python Ver: 3.5.2)
