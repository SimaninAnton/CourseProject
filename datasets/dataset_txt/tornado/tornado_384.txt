Hi
I would like to upload some files(each around 500MB ) from client to server in chunks .
In the client code,the file is separated in chunks and then the client would send the request ,is there something wrong with me to send the files in chunk?
when I execute my code,here comes this problem:
client:

server:

the code is here :https://github.com/congfairy/leaf_upload.git.
when you run the code,you could use the command:
client:
g++ -shared -fPIC -o libuploadclient.so uploadclient.cpp -I/root/Python-3.5.0/Include/ -lpython3.5m -L/usr/local/lib/
g++ main.cpp -o main -I/root/Python-3.5.0/Include/ -lpython3.5m ./libuploadclient.so
./main
server:
python3 server.py
I am so eager to know the answer,thanks!
best regards,
cong
