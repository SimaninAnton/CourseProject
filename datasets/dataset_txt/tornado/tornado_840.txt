We are making a program that mobilephone send json package to web server which used tornado.We find a question that sometimes the tornado web server can not manage the request.When I put 'enter' or 'ctrl +z' on console,all the request that did not be managed will be managed .I want to know what cause this problem,and what should I do to solve it
