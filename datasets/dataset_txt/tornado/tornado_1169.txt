The RequestHandler.write method in web.py automatically converts a dict to JSON, which is nice. But the Content-Type header is given a value of "text/javscript" whereas the standard dictates "application/json".
See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt and http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/index.html
For example jQuery (1.5) will evaluate/run the json rather than convert is into a Javascript object when the Content-Type is text/javascript. You have to explicitly inform jQuery that you expect JSON back.
