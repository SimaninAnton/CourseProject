Is there any documentation on this functionality (#155)? I'm having trouble with it...
 (r'/dir', web.StaticHandler, dict(path="static/dir/", default_filename="index.html"))
gives me an error:
 20:55:23 web.1     | Traceback (most recent call last):
 20:55:23 web.1     |   File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/tornado/web.py", line 988, in _execute
 20:55:23 web.1     |     getattr(self, self.request.method.lower())(*args, **kwargs)
 20:55:23 web.1     | TypeError: get() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
I realize this is because path is non-optional for the StaticHandler and because I don't have a capture in my regex, I suppose it won't work...
Adding a capture doesn't quite solve my problem either:
(r'/dir(.+)', web.StaticHandler, dict(path="static/dir/", default_filename="index.html"))
results in:
21:08:46 web.1     | WARNING:root:403 GET /dir/ (127.0.0.1): / is not in root static directory
Am I using this completely wrong, or was the functionality broke somewhere along the way?
I don't see any test cases related to the default_filename parameter, so I suppose I it might be a bug... but I'm going to assume the problem is between the keyboard and the chair for now.
Would really appreciate some help, thanks!
