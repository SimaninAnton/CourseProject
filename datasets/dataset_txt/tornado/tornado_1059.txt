Tornado makes the login_url configrable, but the query string name for the referer page is hardcoded to "next". This makes it harder to integrate tornado with a login form that is running on another site/framework, such as repoze.who-friendlyform which expects the parameter to be "came_from".
It would be nice if the parameter were configurable.
