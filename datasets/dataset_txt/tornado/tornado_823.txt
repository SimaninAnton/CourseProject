I've spun up a Google App Engine instance using the demo in demos/appengine and I'm getting the following exception when I load the web endpoint:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
    import fcntl
ImportError: No module named fcntl
Has anyone gotten that demo to run on GAE? The ImportError: No module named fcntl exception leads me to believe that tornado/platform/auto module should be selecting another platform for GAE but I'm not sure which. Also, I believe the usage of fcntl related to asynchronous operations which I'm not sure are supported on GAE.
Any guidance on this would be appreciated.
