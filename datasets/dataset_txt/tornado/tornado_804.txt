Tornado 3.2.2 raises quite a lot of these:
ERROR:tornado.application:Exception in callback None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../tornado/ioloop.py", line 688, in start
    self._handlers[fd](fd, events)
KeyError: 8
Tornado is running behind Nginx, handlers are marked as asynchronous and queued for later response.
