I'm trying to use set_secure_cookie and it works perfectly until you try to put too much data in it - working content at 2907 bytes but fails when setting 2965 bytes.
From what I can see, Chrome has a max cookie size of 4096 bytes so not sure if this is a known issue with Tornado or me doing something wrong? Firefox is letting me use a little bit more but not much.
Using Tornado 6.0.3 w/ Python 3.6.8
Cheers in advance :)
