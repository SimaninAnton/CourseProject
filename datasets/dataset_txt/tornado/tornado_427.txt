I find in the official docs that: I have to "python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install" to install the tornado env. I think that is not friendly enough, and that is troubesome to deploy the tornado to the server clusters(decaeds of machines and they are not allowed to connect to the outer network).
Is there a way to setup the tornado by just copying the directory, (and editing the user profile)?
