Just updated tornado from 3.1.1.0 to 4.1 and I'm getting the following error:
"ValueError: I/O operation on closed epoll fd"
The error is raised on Application().listen() and is caused by call to HTTPClient().fetch() preceding it. Commenting self._io_loop.close() in HTTPClient().close() gives the impression of fixing the problem, but I can't find proper solution for now.
Any suggestions?
