I was using python httplib, which by default does POST multipart requests using transfer-encoding: chunked. Tornado unfortunately triggers the application request callback before reading the POST body (which is chunked, and may actually never finish, if the requester is bad :-). I could see how this could cause buffer overflows, so perhaps leaving this out was intentional?
Would you be open to me consider a patch and pull request to httpserver.py to handle this case?
