Hi
Is it possible to do the websocket message receiving & parsing on my own?
Example:
class WebSocket(websocket.WebSocketHandler):
    def open(self):
        ws_fd =  self.connection_fd()
        while True:
            readable, _, _ = select.select([ws_fd], [], [], 1.0)
            for fd in readable:
                data = self.recv_nb()
The reason why I want to do this:
I need to forward all messages coming from the websocket client over a unix socket to a single threaded backend, therefore I need the websocket file descriptor to do a select over both the websocket fd and the unix socket fd.
Is it possible to directly access the websocket file descriptor? Is there any other way of doing this?
