iostream.py provides a way to set a callback that should be invoked when a connection is closed. When using _Select this callback won't be invoked until a read or write is performed on the socket.
Select signals remote hang-ups by creating a read event with 0 byte length. This won't be noticed by iostream's _handle_event when a connection is idle since it only subscribes to io_loop.ERROR events.
This works fine with epoll since epoll with emit a HUP event that will get noticed.
