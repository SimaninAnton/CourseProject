Since Tornado is a (great!) web framework, it would be nice if it had some more built-in security features.
For example, being able to limit the number of HTTP request from a specific client is something that could be used to increate the security of some applications using the Tornado web framework. There are multiple features which could be added to Tornado to increase the security, to protect against XSS, DDOS attacks and other types of attacks.
