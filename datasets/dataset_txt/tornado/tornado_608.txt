gen.convert_yielded() can support yielding individual Deferreds and asyncio.Futures thanks to singledispatch.
Unfortunately when yielding a list of deferreds this fails as they do not get converted to Futures. Currently I work around this with a helper function to convert a list of deferreds into futures manually but this is not ideal.
