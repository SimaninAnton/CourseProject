If in the handler you do:
self.write(None)
when the RequestHandler calls the finish() method, this line:
elif "Content-Length" not in self._headers:
content_length = sum(len(part) for part in self._write_buffer)
crashes, because the self._write_buffer contains the following list: [None]
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
you can't do len() on None, what should be this? 0?
