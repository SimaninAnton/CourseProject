HttpClient generates a warning if the servers respond with a header containing the string ': '. AFAICT, such headers are allowed according to the HTTP-spec in the specification of field-content. (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2)
Luckily, the fix is simple, just add a limit to the split performed in _curl_header_callback:
parts = header_line.split(": ", 1)
