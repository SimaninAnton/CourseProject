Where could I go to find/start reading about existing logging handlers that send messages over the network and play well with tornado?
It seems like a logging handler that does network I/O should be async but I can't find many examples which makes me wonder if I am missing something. Has everyone switched to using an external tool that follows the tornado logs and then ships them off? Or do synchronous loggers work just fine?
The goal I'd like to achieve is to be able to send JSON formatted messages over the network to a remote machine.
So far I've found https://github.com/B2W-BIT/aiologger (async but no networking) and https://github.com/vklochan/python-logstash (networked but not async).
