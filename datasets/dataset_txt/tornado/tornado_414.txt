I can't find anywhere well written testing example and I'm totally confused with
self.fetch or self.http_client.fetch
@testing.gen_test or @gen.coroutine
AsyncHTTPTestCase based self.io_loop
and more too many things.
My GET requests working as I expected but PUT, DELETE etc requests broken and I don't why.
I think demos folder should be included well described, actual testing example. If I got this point, I can add some test, thats why Im opening new Issue.
