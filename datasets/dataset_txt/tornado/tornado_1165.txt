finally I a little understand about tornadoweb asynchronous
the key of asynchronous response is chat example is
    for callback in cls.waiters:
        try:
            callback(messages)
        except:
            logging.error("Error in waiter callback", exc_info=True)
so Is there any solution to store the callback function in datastore or solution if using several computer or process??
e.g :
A request updates to node1, B post data that handled by node2 for A
how to node2 call node1 callback??
