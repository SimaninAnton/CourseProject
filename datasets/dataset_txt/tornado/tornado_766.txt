Hi, I Have This Route:
(r'^/FoodListAdminCP/Recipes/Keywords/Index/?$', handlers.admin.recipe.keyword.Index, None, 'superpanel_recipe_keyword_index'),
But That dont Know What is My Mean From '/?',
That Create This Url:
/FoodListAdminCP/Recipes/Keywords/Index/?
That Can Not Reverse Regex, Correctly
Thanks For Your Time(Sorry, I Can Not Speak English Very Good)
