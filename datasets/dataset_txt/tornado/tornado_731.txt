I used websocket its address is like localhost/xxxxx/socket (xxxxx is chat group's id).
Then I received Uncaught exception from here .
Because callback passed the url parameter (xxxxx) to open method , but it can't receive the parameter.
I can avoid it by enabling oepn to receive the parameter in my inherited class.
But comment on open describes that The arguments to open are extracted from the tornado.web.URLSpec,
So I think open has to be defined by open(self, *args, **kwargs) like get(self, *args, **kwargs).
If so, above Uncaught exception won't occur.
