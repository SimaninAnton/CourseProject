Not sure if it's by design, but in get_secure_cookie(), a cookie over 31 days is always considered expired. It has no relation to expires_days argument in set_secure_cookie. Effectively it means that providing expires_days > 31 in set_secure_cookie() will have no effect and cookie will last for 31 days.
