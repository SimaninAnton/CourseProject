There are hard-coded defaults of 20 seconds for both values, and the user cannot set e.g. connect_timeout=0 as 0 evaluates to false and the default value is used.
class HTTPRequest(object):
    def __init__(self, url, method="GET", headers={}, body=None,
                 ...
                 connect_timeout=None, request_timeout=None,
                 ...):
        ...
        self.connect_timeout = connect_timeout or 20.0
        self.request_timeout = request_timeout or 20.0
        ...
With the current code I can emulate it this way:
HTTPRequest(..., request_timeout=0.1)
0.1 evaluates to true, so the default is not set, and when request_timeout is later cast to int, the result is 0. But this is quite ugly :)
