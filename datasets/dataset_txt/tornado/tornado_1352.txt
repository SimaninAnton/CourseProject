I have a some machines with Solaris 10 and I wanted to try/use tornado on them also - but select() is very limited -, so I created a new little class (based on your _Select class) that uses libevent, so you can have better polling methods on non-linux systems.
It depends on python-libevent.
Here you can find my modification, Solaris/FreeBSD users may find it useful:
