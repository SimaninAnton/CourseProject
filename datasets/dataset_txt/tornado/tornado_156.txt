There is an error when making an edit to blog post for the blog demo in the demo section.
Error is copy pasted here:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/jpru5/blog/env/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/web.py", line 1592, in _execute
result = yield result
File "/home/jpru5/blog/env/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1133, in run
value = future.result()
File "app.py", line 189, in post
slug = entry.slug
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'slug'
line 189 reads "slug = entry.slug" but it should read "slug = entry[0].slug" since "self.query(..." on line 186 returns a list of dictionaries
...or better yet, where line 186 has "self.query(..." it should be replaced with "self.queryone(..."
