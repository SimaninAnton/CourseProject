Hello Team,
I am not sure what is going on, but it looks that spec.regex.match does not match correctly self.request.path in web.py.
Example and screen shot from debugging session:
application = tornado.web.Application(
        handlers=[
            (r"/items", ItemsHandler),
            (r"/items/(.*)", ItemHandler),
        ])
Could you advise what is wrong here?
Cheers,
Pawel
