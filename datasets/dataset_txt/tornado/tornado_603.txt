Even in the minimal Tornado example connecting via https to non-https Tornado server causes probably connection closing on timeout (expected is certificate warning).
Issue is maybe with regex in _read_message() method in http2connection.py. When header is encrypted, regex won't find anything and header_future is None.
This will be passed to start() function in ioloop.py and empty callbacks will be called until timeout. That's maybe good in other cases, but in my opinion with https is expected certificate warning.
I hope I tracked the issue correctly :)
