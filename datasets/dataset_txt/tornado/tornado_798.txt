Hello,
Nikola is using livereload, which depends on Tornado without a version specifier, so pip is now trying to install version 4.0.0.
But, for some reason, version 4.0.0 cannot be installed on Windows without VC++ and its compiler. Why is that? Could you please:
(a) fix this and allow usage without speedups; or
(b) build a wheel package and publish it on PyPI?
