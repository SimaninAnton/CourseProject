Hi,
https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/web.py#L194
The definition of the initialize method does not have the **kwargs argument. However, it is expected to be invoked in the derived class with key-value arguments.
Is it a good practice that we omit the **kwargs argument in the method definition?
I am asking because the PyCharm IDE think it is wrong, even though my code works well so far.
