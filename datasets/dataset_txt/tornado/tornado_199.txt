When using FallbackHandler for running a WSGI application using WSGIContainer the RequestHandler.on_finish() method is never called.
Modifying FallbackHandler.prepare() this way seems to fix the issue, but I may not be familiar enough with Tornado's internals.
    def prepare(self):
        self.fallback(self.request)
        self._finished = True
        self.on_finished()
