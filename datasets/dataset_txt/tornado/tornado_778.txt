Is okay to put that logic on 'write', if 'write' function receive dict o list dumps to JSON ?, I am using tornado as backed for angular, and i have to handle the list in a lot of places so i need to set the header import JSON dumps and send to 'write', or maybe, a good approach will be to write a new function to handle all JSON responses like a 'write_json'
