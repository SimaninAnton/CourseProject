My new redirect function is (Line 387 of web.py)
I just changed the "permanent" to support my use cases which needs status code of 303.
def redirect(self, url, status=301):
    """Sends a redirect to the given (optionally relative) URL."""
    if self._headers_written:
        raise Exception("Cannot redirect after headers have been written")
    self.set_status(status)
    # Remove whitespace
    url = re.sub(r"[\x00-\x20]+", "", _utf8(url))
    self.set_header("Location", urlparse.urljoin(self.request.uri, url))
    self.finish()
Based on: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
It looks like returning 302 (for a login post) isn't the right thing to do since;
"If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. "
Sorry for not having a proper pull request, but git is on my list to learn after tornado!! =)
