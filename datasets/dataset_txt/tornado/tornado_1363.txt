A nice to have would be for the request handler to automatically append a / to urls that don't have one, similar to how Django does it.
Currently I'm configuring urls like this
application = tornado.web.Application([
(r"/", MainHandler),
(r"/test/*", views.TestHandler),
])
But being able to drop the regex * would make for simpler code and reduce a chance of a typo by forgetting to include it.
