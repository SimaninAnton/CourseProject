I'm using @tornado.web.stream_request_body for file uploading, which sould work fine. However, when I put tornado behind a nginx, the request fails with a 502 response, with an error log from nginx showing that upstream server temporarily disabled while reading response header from upstream.
It seems that methods like prepare and data_received are working but post is never reached.
Is there any problem with tornado? Or its related to nginx configuration?
