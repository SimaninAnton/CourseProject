If I start a server python wsserver.py and then run python wsclient.py --host localhost --port 8888 the tornado server and client behave as expected.
However, if I start up a proxy server as well: node node_modules/http-proxy/bin/node-http-proxy --port 8889 --host localhost --target localhost:8888 then python wsclient.py --host localhost --port 8889 does connect, but no messages get passed.
This works fine on Max osx however fails on ubuntu and centos.
see this stackoverflow question for details
