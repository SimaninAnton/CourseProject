I have seen this multiple times, sometimes tornado appends two messages being sent together.
HeartBeat gets appended (Notice 'h' at the end of quote) to the quote and JSON fails to parse.
`a["[256, 1, \"NSECM\", \"\", \"\", 3351, 0, 485432, 198936872.48, \"l\", \"+\", \"\", \"\", 5, 514.5, 35, 0, 0, 514.0, 513.7, 519.25, 512.1, 245467, 319739, 452.2, 552.6, 516.14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, [514.45, 514.4, 514.35, 514.3, 514.25], [], [55, 216, 471, 450, 629], [], [514.5, 514.65, 514.7, 514.75, 514.8], [], [6, 44, 87, 1233, 291], []]"]h`

`Error : Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token h in JSON at position 345|URL : https://manik.walle.internal.utradesolutions.com/|Line Number : 1|Client ID : MANIK5|Time : Sun Aug 26 2018 12:46:43`
Similarly I have many times other messages being sent been binded together. Why is tornado doing so?
a["PONG"]a["DATE 2018-04-350477723"]
How to avoid this?
