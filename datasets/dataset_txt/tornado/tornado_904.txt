Why does tornado.escape.xhtml_escape have two different aliases? (See Templates)
Expressions can be any Python expression, including function calls. Template code is executed in a namespace that includes the following objects and functions (Note that this list applies to templates rendered using RequestHandler.render and render_string. If you're using the template module directly outside of a RequestHandler many of these entries are not present).
escape: alias for tornado.escape.xhtml_escape
xhtml_escape: alias for tornado.escape.xhtml_escape
