This is a rather unusual enhancement request:
Tornado has a very powerful IOLoop that is great for Aysnc IO, specially on python 2.7.
The ioloop can be used by itself for many application, not necessarily web-related.
It would be very nice to be able the get all the goodness of ioloop without the whopping 3.7MB of the entire package.
This is especially important for embedded systems where package size actually matters.
Using Namespace packages this change can be done quit elegantly and maybe even without breaking the API.
