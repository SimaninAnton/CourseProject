locale module is making some assumptions behind the scenes based on locale code. Some of them are useful and self-explanatory (like automatic switching 12/24 hour clock formats).
But there's one thing I can't understand. I suggest you at least consider this a documentation bug, unless I'm missing something. This is a snippet from locale.py:
def format_date(self, date, gmt_offset=0, relative=True, shorter=False,
                full_format=False):
    """Formats the given date (which should be GMT).

By default, we return a relative time (e.g., "2 minutes ago"). You
can return an absolute date string with ``relative=False``.

[snip]
"""
    if self.code.startswith("ru"):
        relative = False
The very first pair of lines in the method just forces relative to False in some particular cases. Why? Blame button reveals that the lines in question were there even before moving code to git/github, so maybe they are obsolete now?
