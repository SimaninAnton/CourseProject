Hi guys, I am frustrating with this, after trying everything and read everything, I write this issue.
I'm on a mac, and can't install anything with pipenv. The site pypi.org rarely open, with I try to install anything gives me errors like that, even with pip I add errors like that but after there if i try to do the same command like 15 times I can install the package.
Can you guys help me out. Thanks
