Hello everyone,
Current workflow of pip have an issue for example :
for example if you want to add pytest as dependency but you make a typo and forget e
pipenv install pytst
because of there isnt any package named pytst but Pipenv still adds it to Pipfile
Issue description
cat PipFile will still show that pytst added to Pipfile
Expected result
it must be added to Pipfile after checking that package exists
