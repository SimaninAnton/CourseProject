A common pattern in Django projects is spliting requirements in differents files. We do this in our company following the recommendations of the Two Scoops of Django of @pydanny and @audreyr. In cookiecutter-django you can see this patterns: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/tree/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/requirements
So, my thought is that pipenv needs to provide more options besides the regular pipenv install and pipenv install --dev. Maybe something like pipenv install requests --section=production and then pipenv install --section=production to install all the production related packages.
