I am trying to achieve the following in a Pipefile. Notice the double bsddb3:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
bsddb3 = {version = "==6.2.6", sys_platform = "!= 'win32'"}
bsddb3 = {file = "https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/l8ulg3xw/bsddb3-6.2.6-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl", sys_platform = "== 'win32'", platform_machine = "== 'AMD64'"}

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
The problem with this is that I get an exception saying Duplicate keys found
bsddb3 requires installation like the above for the Windows platform. But for my Linux users they should still just install the normal bsddb3. How would I achieve this, as the above clearly does not work?
