I just noticed the tweet https://twitter.com/KumarVimal/status/1057149022346137600 . Apparently pipenv has an easter egg that shows a pumpkin around Halloween, see
pipenv/pipenv/core.py
Lines 73 to 93 in d069dff
 if not PIPENV_HIDE_EMOJIS: 
     now = time.localtime() 
     # Halloween easter-egg. 
     if ((now.tm_mon == 10) and (now.tm_mday == 30)) or ( 
         (now.tm_mon == 10) and (now.tm_mday == 31) 
     ): 
         INSTALL_LABEL = "üéÉ   " 
     # Christmas easter-egg. 
     elif ((now.tm_mon == 12) and (now.tm_mday == 24)) or ( 
         (now.tm_mon == 12) and (now.tm_mday == 25) 
     ): 
         INSTALL_LABEL = "üéÖ   " 
     else: 
         INSTALL_LABEL = "üêç   " 
     INSTALL_LABEL2 = crayons.normal("‚ò§  ", bold=True) 
     STARTING_LABEL = "    " 
 else: 
     INSTALL_LABEL = "   " 
     INSTALL_LABEL2 = "   " 
     STARTING_LABEL = "   " 
 # Enable shell completion. 
. I'm really worried about this.
I'm aware that some people find easter eggs an amusing gimmick in software. However easter-eggs make software unpredictable and are a even potential security. This is especially true for easter eggs that are triggered by default. CPython has some easter eggs like import this, however they are never triggered either time, environment, or default. Pipenv strives to become a defacto tool for Python's packaging infrastructure. Please be more responsible and serious.
Bugs like Gimme Gimme Gimme have been caused by easter eggs.
