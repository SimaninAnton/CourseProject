Running pipenv install generates a lockfile that includes an incompatible version of pypiwin32 (version 220). Installation subsequently fails. I think it should include version 219 instead, since that version is compatible with Python 2.7.
Describe your environment

Windows 7
Python version: $ python -V
Python 2.7.13
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.3.2
Expected result
I expected it to install only compatible versions.
Actual result
$ pipenv install
