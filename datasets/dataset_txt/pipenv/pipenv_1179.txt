Describe the issue briefly here.
pipenv hangs, and will not complete an installation of pyparsing
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
(Note this is from Ubuntu running in the Windows subsystem for Linux.)
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
pipenv to terminate -- perhaps with error message
Actual result
pipenv never terminates, whether pyparsing is being installed either as a dependency of another package, or by itself.
Steps to replicate
$ mkdir /tmp/pyparsing; cd $_
$  pipenv install --verbose pyparsing
