I'm playing with a Pyramid cookiecutter template (specifically, https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy), and pipenv is having trouble with the -e option.
(pyramid-kalVa7_8) ➜  my_app git:(master) pipenv install -e .
Installing -e .…
⠴
Error:  An error occurred while installing -e .!
Directory '.' is not installable. File 'setup.py' not found.

(pyramid-kalVa7_8) ➜  my_app git:(master) ls
CHANGES.txt     MANIFEST.in     README.txt      development.ini my_app production.ini  pytest.ini      setup.py
(pyramid-kalVa7_8) ➜  my_app git:(master) pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.2.4
The behavior that I'd hope to see is 1) all of the Pyramid project dependencies are installed into the environment and 2) the Pipfile is updated appropriately.
For context, this is a pipenv virtualenv running Python 3.6 and I ran pipenv shell prior to running the above shell lines.
