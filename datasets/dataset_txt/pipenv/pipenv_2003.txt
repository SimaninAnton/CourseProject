Trying to get install pipenv in a docker env, I got:
Exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (pip 8.1.1 (/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('pip>=9.0.1'))
This of course no longer happens once I run pip install --upgrade pip
While I understand it's probably not appropriate to list pip as a dependency and require an upgrade, there should be a big warning in the installation section of the README and the doc with appropriate advices.
One possible solution: it's easy to pip install pipsi --user and then python -m pipsi pipenv. You never have to worry about having the bin in PATH, or to have pip at the proper version.
