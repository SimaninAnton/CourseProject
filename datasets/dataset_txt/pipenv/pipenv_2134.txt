Is this a good idea to write warnings like below to stderr instead of stdout?

Changing this behavior able to do something like this:
$ pipenv lock --requirements 1> requirements.txt 2> /dev/null
Then result requirements.txt file will not contain anything else freezed pip requirements. May be it will be useful in some another cases.
