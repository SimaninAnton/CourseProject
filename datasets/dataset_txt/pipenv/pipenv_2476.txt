Hi, thanks for yet another awesome tool!
I wander if there is any plans to add commands abbreviations for example in scripts section.
So instead of typing each time pipenv run python -m unittest discover it will be enough to run pipenv test (or maybe pipenv apply test) if we have this in the Pipfile:
[[scripts]]
test = "python -m unittest discover"
