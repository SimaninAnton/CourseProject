Currently I can't find a way to turn on confirmation prompt before creating a new virtualenv. I often call pipenv shell from the wrong directory and stop it right away, cause it starts to create a new environment. Then I need to remove Pipfile by hand. This is not convenient. How about adding a confirmation prompt before creating a new venv for some commands like shell or run? Or maybe a --create flag?
