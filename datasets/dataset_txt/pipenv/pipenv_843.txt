There are a ton of issues mentioning pipenv install, so this one might already be present, or for some reason intentional, so apologies in advance if so.
Issue description
pipenv install doesn't actually install the package itself (just its dependencies).
Expected result
It should install the package itself as well.
Actual result
It doesn't.
Steps to replicate
Run pipenv install, then pipenv run python -m pip list, and the package isn't installed in the virtualenv.
