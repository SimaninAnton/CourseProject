Describe your environment
pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
Pipenv should print a help text explaining how to use the pipenv run sub-command. This should be done regardless of whether pipenv run accepts a complex family of options which is worth a help text or not, in order to make it consistent with other Pipenv sub-commands which all accepts -h / --help.
Actual result
$ pipenv run -h
