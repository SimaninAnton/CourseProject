Hi, we're running into some issues that make pipenv (which I really like by the way), unfortunately unusable for us.
The current "dev-packages" and "packages" mechanism, while enough for many simple use cases, does not allow to express dependencies that are only available in production, be it because of system dependencies (e.g. picamera can't be installed on a mac or windows), hardware dependencies (GPU dependencies on a laptop without a GPU), or simply because we do not want that dependency in dev.
I know there are a number of closed issues that relate to this very problem, however I don't think any of them mention packages that are production-only by design. This is a major hurdle and having a separate workflow for production seems to defeat the purpose of a package manager, at least for us.
Any chance a solution might be implemented in the short-term @kennethreitz ?
