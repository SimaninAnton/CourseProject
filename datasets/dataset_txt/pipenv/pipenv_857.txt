Issue description
When installing pylint with python 3.6.6 dependencies could not be resolved to lock.
On Centos 7, Python 2.7.5, pipenv, version 2018.7.1, pylint was installed without any issues.
Also tested on docker python image, and it installs pylint without problems too. Looks like problem on my computer.
Expected result
pylint installed and dependencies locked
Actual result
$ pipenv install pylint --dev --verbose
