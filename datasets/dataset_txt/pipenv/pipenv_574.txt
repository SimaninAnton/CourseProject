Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I have a script to wrap pyre that ends thus:
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

if [[ x"$PIPENV_ACTIVE" != x"1" ]] ; then
   echo activate pipenv by running pipenv shell or pipenv run "$DIR"/pyre
   exit 2
fi

exec pyre --search-path "$(pipenv --venv)/lib/python3.6/site-packages" "$@"
Unfortunately, the second suggestion doesn't work as things currently are.
Describe the solution you'd like
PIPENV_ACTIVE should be set when you run pipenv run, just as it is when you run pipenv shell.
Describe alternatives you've considered
None.
Additional context
I'm about to submit a pull request. Is running pipenv --support really necessary here?
