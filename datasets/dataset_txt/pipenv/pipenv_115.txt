Issue description
I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature, lol. But When locking a pipfile with the dependency pypwin32 then also pywin32 gets added. My system is not compatible with pywin32 and therefore it fails when installing.
Steps to replicate
Create a pipfile with pypwin32 in it. Lock and check pipfile.lock
$ pipenv --support
