Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The problem is that it is always slow to do an install/uninstall with the graph resolving.
Describe the solution you'd like
If I want to uninstall and install something at the same time that would help.
Possible solution: also allow -i and -u syntax for adding package to install and uninstall.
pipenv install something -u somethingelse
Describe alternatives you've considered
Help speeding up the graph resolving.
