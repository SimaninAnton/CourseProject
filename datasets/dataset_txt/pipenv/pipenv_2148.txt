Hi there,
macOSX / brew / fresh install here. I realized I wanted to use fish and not bash so I'm trying to back track and reinstall everything under fish. However, pipenv is still in /usr/local/bin after uninstalling python. What step am I missing?
I did
$ brew install python2
$ pip2 install pipenv
$ brew uninstall python
so then which pipenv returns /usr/local/bin/pipenv.
