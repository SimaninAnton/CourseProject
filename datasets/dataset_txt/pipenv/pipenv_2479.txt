With the latest version (3.2.10), installing one package that depends on another causes the first package's dependencies to get locked:
$ pipenv install --dev pytest-django==3.1.2 pytest==2.9.2 --lock
In this case pytest-django specifies install_requires=['pytest>=2.9']. I would expect my request to specifically install pytest==2.9.2 to be present in the lock file, but it is not:

        "pytest-django": {
            "hash": "sha256:00995c...",
            "version": "==3.1.2"
        },
        "pytest": {
            "hash": "sha256:da0ab5...",
            "version": "==3.0.6"
        },
