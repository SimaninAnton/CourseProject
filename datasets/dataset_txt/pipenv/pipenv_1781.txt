I have defined my project as editable in Pipfile with myproject = {path=".", editable=true}.
Without an initial Pipfile.lock and an existing virtualenv, pipenv install generates a Pipfile.lock with
"myproject": {
    "editable": true,
    "path": "."
},
Running pipenv lock now changes the Pipfile.lock to:
    "myproject": {
        "editable": true,
-       "path": "."
+       "git": "git@github.com:xxxxx/myproject.git@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
Expected result
The Pipfile.lock shouldn't have changed.
Describe your environment
Pipenv version: 8.3.2
