Hello,
Is there a way to use pipenv with tox or travis, or twice with different package version.
I read the doc. it's for different python's version but there is nothing about packages.
I 'd like to do something like this with pipenv :
[tox]
envlist =
       {py35,py36}-django{110,111}
anyway thanks for pipenv
