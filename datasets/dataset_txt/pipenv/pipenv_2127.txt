Is there any reason override is set to True here? dotenv.load_dotenv(denv, override=True)
I prefer using envdir since it lets me explicitly define the environment variables for local development vs production. I end up creating a .env file anyway for compatibility with other software like pipenv, docker-compose, pycharm, etc.
When I want to run my app locally using production environment variables, I'm running into an issue because of the override=True.
The command envdir envs/prod pipenv run python src/manage.py runserver will end up using the .env variables instead of those provided through envdir.
Can you either set override to False or allow disabling .env files?
