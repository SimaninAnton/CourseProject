Is it possible to specify which pip version that is used when installing to system? If I have both pip2 and pip3 installed and run pipenv install --system, then everything is installed using pip2 even if Pipfile has
[requires]
python_version = '3.6'
Which is an indicator that pipenv should install packages using pip3
