Issue description
At this point in time(and probably not when you read this):
pygame has a 1.9.4.post1 source only release
but 1.9.4 release with binaries for windows
However, Pipenv selects the 1.9.4.post1 source only release on windows.
This is different behaviour from pip, which selects the binary file.
The pip behaviour results in a working install.
