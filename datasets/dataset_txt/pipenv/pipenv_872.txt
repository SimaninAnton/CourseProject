In a working directory I run,
pipenv run pip install rlp==0.6.0
When I then run
pip lock
Pipfile.lock isn't updated with the lower version number version, and running pip sync takes me back to the broken, newer version.
I would like to be able to force override of requirements -- currently I am just generating a requirements.txt with pip lock -r but my feeling is there should be a more graceful way of doing this.
Possibly if the lower level pip commands were also reflected in pipenv?
