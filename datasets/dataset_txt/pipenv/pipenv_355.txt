In my development .env file I have set WORKON_HOME to a directory other than my user's home directory (and not the project directory). The docs say that .env files are automatically loaded by the shell and run commands. If I want to create a new venv (for instance, if I'm upgrading the Python version), then I remove the old venv and the old Pipfile.lock. I would like to create the new venv and have all dependencies installed with one command (pipenv install), but I can't. pipenv install, when run by itself, does create a venv from the Pipfile, but it does not load .env and so does not create the venv where I wanted it to go. In the event that pipenv install is run by itself, would it make sense to have it load the .env file? And as a follow on question, would it make sense to always have 'install load the .env file?
