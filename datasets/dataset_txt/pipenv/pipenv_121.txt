Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'd like to use the skip_lock persistent option, but I need a way to override this behavior when I eventually do need to create a lock file.
Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like to be able to say --no-skip-lock to override my environment variable
Describe alternatives you've considered
I can just pass --skip-lock every time instead of using the environment variable, however this defeats the point of the persistent option's existing in the first place.
Additional context
N/A
$ pipenv --support
