This doesn't seem consistent, but it appears that pipenv is looking up packages differently than pip. e.g. msgpack-python fails to install, but google-api-python-client works fine (resolving to the version with all underscores).
Â± pipenv install msgpack-python
Installing msgpack...
Collecting msgpack

Error:  An error occurred while installing msgpack!
