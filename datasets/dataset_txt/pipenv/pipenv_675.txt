Issue description
Significant latency between publishing a python module in PyPi and being able to pull it via pipenv update . I can update it immediately via pip install -U , but not with pipenv. After 30 minutes or more - not sure exactly how long, I can run pipenv update and it will show that it is updated in the Pipfile.lock as expected.
This may not be a bug - but a feature resulting from caching, but I can't figure out how to bypass the cache if so.
Expected result
Expect that pipenv update updates the module immediately after publishing it on PyPi
Actual result
Significant latency, minutes to hours in order to update a module after publishing an update on PyPi.
Steps to replicate
Publish module to PyPi
Immediately run pipenv update <module>
Check Pipfile.lock - note module is not updated
Wait ..........
Re-run update cmd
Check Pipfile.lock - see the module is updated.
$ pipenv --support
