$ python -m pipenv.help output
------------
Expected result
I can use a config in Pipfile to control pipenv to create/look for the virtualenv in my project.
Whether a virtualenv lives in the project itself is, by nature, as the name of the config suggests, a per-project setting, not a per-pipenv-invocation settings. In the current setup, when I checkout my project, I want to pipenv install, then that's it, then it's just installed to the right position and I can start working. Rather than everyone in my team has to prepend env PIPENV_VIRTUALENV_IN_PROJECT=1 to every pipenv command they run. It's just better to have it configured for the project.
I can also live with both, but I think it would make a lot of sense to support the same configuration in the Pipfile itself.
Example config:
[pipenv]
venv_in_project = true
# alternatively, we can allow specifying the concrete path to the virtualenv, 
# but have to deal with absolute/relative path, which is more complex
venv_path = ...
Actual result
It's not possible.
