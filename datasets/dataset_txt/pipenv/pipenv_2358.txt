In pipenv version 3.5.6, 'dev-packages' are not considered during the update operation.
Steps to reproduce:
mkdir project && cd project
pipenv install
pipenv install --dev flake8
pipenv update
Pipenv installs flake8 and adds it to Pipfile as a dev-package (as expected).
However pipenv update purges flake8. Also, pipenv update --dev purges and reinstalls flake8. The expected behavior is that pipenv does not delete dev-packages on any update operation.
