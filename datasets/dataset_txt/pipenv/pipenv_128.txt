Issue description
When I try this : pipenv install django-crispy
There is an insert in Pipfile even before the installation is successful:
[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
django = "*"
black = "==19.3b0"
django-crispy = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.7"
Now, in this instance, there is no package- djang-crispy and the install fails with this error below:
pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure: ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches django-crispy
[pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: No versions found
[pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
First try clearing your dependency cache with $ pipenv lock --clear, then try the original command again.
Alternatively, you can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
Hint: try $ pipenv lock --pre if it is a pre-release dependency.
ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches django-crispy
No versions found
Was https://pypi.org/simple reachable?
Now, if you try and ignore and carry on installing any other valid package, the install will not continue as it always tries to install django-crispy.
Expected result
I am not sure if this is by design. But there should not be any entry before the installation is successful. I have to manually delete the django-cripsy entry from Pipfile and only then I can proceed with other install.
