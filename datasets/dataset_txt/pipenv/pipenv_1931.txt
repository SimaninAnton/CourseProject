Describe you environment
MacOS 10.13
Python version: Python 3.6.3
Pipenv version: Pipenv 8.2.7
Expected result
Converting an existing project that uses requirements.txt, Pipenv creates a Pipfile with pinned versions and a Pipfile.lock with the versions from my requirements.txt. It then tells me I might want to unpin my Pipfile. I expected there to be a process for unpinning my Pipfile while maintaining my Pipfile.lock, but pipenv wants to recreate my Pipfile.lock whenever I change my Pipfile.
Actual result
I can't find any documented way to remove the version pins from Pipfile without the next invocation of pipenv install upgrading all my packages. The only way I have found is to let pipenv regenerate Pipfile.lock, then discard all the changes except the meta hash.
