Hi there, I'm looking to switch from plain old pip to pipenv but I'm having trouble finding a comparable workflow for private package indexes that require HTTP Basic Auth specified in the index URL.
With plain old pip (9.0.1), it's quite easy to point to a package index with basic auth using ~/.pip/pip.conf or $VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf:
[global]
index-url = https://MY_USERNAME:MY_PASSWORD@some.artifactory.mycorp.com/artifactory/api/pypi/python/simple
Because of the basic auth in the URL, it's actually beneficial that this is kept separate from our dependencies. We track our requirements in git; meanwhile the creds are kept in an untracked config file that varies for each member of our team (since they'll all have their own personal creds).
Can pipenv support a workflow like this?
FWIW I tried removing the [[sources]] section in hopes that it would fall back to pip.conf, but no such luck. At least for us, this would be quite amenable as every package is expected to be pulled from our single private index anyway.
Thanks!
