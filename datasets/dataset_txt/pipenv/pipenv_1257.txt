$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
The install uses a symlink so that my code can be edited and re-run without re-installing.
Actual result
A duplicate of my code appeared in the virtualenv's src directory. It is not a symlink.
The Pipfile.lock contains a reference to a specific commit of my code's Git repository, which implies that a separate copy is cloned.
...
"mypackage": {
    "editable": true,
    "git": "git@github.com:myorg/my-package.git",
    "ref": "a30098a534d2ccb41sb907db3ef2a8c0cda2460c"
},
...
Steps to replicate
Note that there are 2 other packages in my Pipfile that are also editable installs from Git.
git clone git@github.com:myorg/my-package.git
cd my-package
pipenv install -e .
# Edit mypackage/__main__.py with text editor...
diff mypackage/__main__.py $(pipenv --venv)/src/mypackage/__main__.py
There is a diff. And running the code using pipenv run python -m mypackage uses the copy located in the virtualenv, not the repository where I executed pipenv install -e ..
