Hello,
First, thanks a lot for this project! It certainly fills in a missing piece of functionality in the Python ecosystem.
However, I just ran into an issue when running with a combination of:
Python 2.7.10 (brew installed on OS X 10.12.2 (16C67))
pip 9.0.1
pipenv, version 3.3.4
aiming to create an environment using Python 3.6.0 (findable via $PATH)
I try to install from scratch /w a new Pipfile like this:
[..]$ rm -rf Pipfile* && LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8' pipenv --three install
