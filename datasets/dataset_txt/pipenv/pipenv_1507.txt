While using a not-created-by-pipenv virtualenv, running pipenv --venv when a Pipfile is not present does not print a path to the current virtualenv.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Fedora 27 (4.15.4-300.fc27.x86_64)
Python version: pipenv installed with Python 3.6.4. Tested with virtualenvs from Python 3.6.4 and 2.7.14.
Pipenv version: 10.1.2
Expected result
A path to the current virtualenv.
Actual result
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project.
No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!
Steps to replicate
$ mkdir venv_test
$ cd venv_test
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pipenv --venv

$ touch Pipfile
$ pipenv --venv
