When using environment variables for private repositories as sources like this:
${my_environ_var}
everything works perfectly, but the environment variable gets substituted into clear text in the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. If I git push everything, everyone could see my Username and Password of my private pip repository.
I am not sure if this is a bug, or if this is intended, but then I don't understand the use of this.
