I would like to request a command line option for specifying the source during pip install. For example, given this Pipfile (from the docs):
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[[source]]
url = "http://pypi.home.kennethreitz.org/simple"
verify_ssl = false
name = "home"
I would like to be able to invoke something like:
pipenv install --index home mypackage
Which would install from my "home" index and add this into my Pipfile:
[packages]
mypackage = {version="*", index="home"}
