Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv.
Check the diagnose documentation for common issues before posting! We may close your issue if it is very similar to one of them. Please be considerate, or be on your way.
Make sure to mention your debugging experience if the documented solution failed.
Issue description
pipenv --python X.Y command checks pyenv's version list and does not like the debug builds (whose versions look like X.Y.Z-debug) failing with a traceback.
Expected result
I would expect pipenv to ignore unsupported versions silently (and with one warning per incompatible version in verbose mode), and proceed with installing what it wants.
Actual result
pyenv versions
pipenv --python 3.6.4 (traceback)
Steps to replicate
$ mkdir pipenv-temp; cd pipenv-temp
$ pyenv install 3.6.4
$ pyenv install 3.6.6 --debug
$ pipenv --python 3.6.4
pipenv --support is not much of a help here, because it tries to report a list of existing python versions.
