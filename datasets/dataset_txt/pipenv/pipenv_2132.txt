It would be amazing if pipenv could be used to manage the users local environment, that is often used to have python software readily available.
Basically, if I need for example borgbackup I install it using
pip3 install --user borgbackup
This in turn drops the necessary packages into ~/.local/lib/python3.6/ and executables into ~/.local/bin, so I have borg in my $PATH.
If I could now manage this environment with pipenv, that'd be swell.
