Doing pipenv uninstall -d nose does not remove the package from Pipfile.
The cause is because in here happens this pipfile_remove = False.
Is there a reason? Removing that line fixes the issue.
I would expect the package to be removed from the Pipfile, whether its a dev or non dev package.
I can submit a PR if required.
