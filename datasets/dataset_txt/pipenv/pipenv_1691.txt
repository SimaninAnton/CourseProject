Commit 76e5faa deleted the homebrew install instructions from the docs. May I ask why?
I would like to see these instructions reinstated. (I have been maintaining the homebrew formula for pipenv, so I'm biased)
However, if the decision to not document homebrew based installation stands, then there are a few other mentions in the docs and README which need cleaning up. Including a link on https://docs.pipenv.org which currently 404s.
