It would be awesome if Pipfile could be parsed to allow for environment variables.
While it's great that pipenv supports private indexes, it's annoying if those indexes require credentialsâ€”it's bad practice to store them in source control:
[[source]]

url = "https://{{ MY_USERNAME }}:{{ MY_PASSWORD }}@my_custom_repo.jfrog.io/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
Happy to contribute a PR for this if this gets some thumbs.
