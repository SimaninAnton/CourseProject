I am converting an already-running django project on an Ubuntu server over to pipenv. I converted my requirements.txt file over to Pipfile and Pipfile.lock on my local system, and it's running fine. When I ssh into the server, pull down my code, and run pipenv install, the system can hang for over 30 minutes (usually I stop the VM after a few minutes).
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output














Expected result
Create a new .venv with dependencies.
Actual result
Hangs the server for 30+ minutes with what seems to be pegged disk read bytes (nearly 200MB/min) (minimal network activity and <10% CPU usage).
The console returned this: https://pastebin.com/Rn5v7T01
I piped pipenv install into a log file and got this: https://pastebin.com/GUsEA11b
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
> pipfile install
