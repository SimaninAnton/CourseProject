I work on packages I'd like to run in multiple versions of python. How do you recommend interactively debugging a package with multiple python versions? Could there be a bit of documentation added about how to maintain virtualenvs for both py2 and py3, for working in 2/3 compatible packages, with some workflow guidance? Thanks.
