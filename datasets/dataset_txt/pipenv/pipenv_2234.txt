pipenv lock may fail to resolve dependencies if for example there are conflicting requirements on the version number.
At the moment this can be hard to debug, because the problematic dependency may be an indirect dependency, and so there's no easy way to determine the its location in the dependency tree.
piptools already has some nice logging in place to show how dependencies are resolved. It seems to work recursively, resolving one "layer" of dependencies at a time, and at each layer it prints out, for each "new" dependency, which dependency from the previous layer brought it in.
If a --verbose option was added that enabled this log output it would make it much easier to resolve dependency conflicts. Alternatively, any option which caused it to list not just the constriants on a package, but the source of those constraints too would solve the problem.
