When I use emacs, I can activate virtual environment by point to venv dir. But it is harder when I use pipenv since it's venv dir is deep in .local/.
Could there be a command like pipenv link venv that is similar to ln -s ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/some-venv venv?
I am sure others will find this useful to have a alias of venv in root dir
