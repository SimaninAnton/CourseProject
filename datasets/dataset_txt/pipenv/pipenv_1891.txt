Reference: #952.
Parsing Ã  Pipfile using pipenv adds many dependencies (ex: flake8.cli).
Is it possible to split the parsing part from the pipenv CLI into a different package?
I would like to contribute to at least ReadTheDocs and PBR to help them support Pipfile, and that would help a lot if everyone use the same parser.
