My project is working fine with Pipfile/pipenv. But only if I install using pipenv install --sequential.
If I then run pipenv install without that flag, the command succeeds. However subsequently trying to use one of the editable (-e) packages causes an ImportError.
I can replicate the following flow:
pipenv install --sequential -> succeeds
pipenv run ./manage.py db upgrade -> succeeds
pipenv install -> succeeds!!!
pipenv run ./manage.py db upgrade -> FAILS with ImportError referencing one of the -e packages.
(steps 1-4 can repeat forever)
