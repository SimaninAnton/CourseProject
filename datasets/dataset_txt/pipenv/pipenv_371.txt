i have a project a that has a dependency on project b. project b requires project c. project b is managed by pipenv. i need to import project c github tag. I accomplish this fine in pipfile. When trying to install dependencies in project a I now have to create a setup file. I have to duplicate my efforts to create and manually maintain a pipfile, a requirements txt and setup.py?
Is this desired behaviour? whats the point of a requirements.txt intermediary that feeds setup py?
I have read the distinctions between a library and dependency setup is duplication the way forward here?
