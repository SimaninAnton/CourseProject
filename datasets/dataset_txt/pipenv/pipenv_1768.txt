The Basic Usage of Pipenv document only covers how to create and modify the virtual environment, but nothing about how to run it. The pipenv run command is not mentioned, and pipenv shell is only mentioned in terms of configuration, not usage.
I wanted to find this information because I was told in another bug that "You really shouldn't be doing much of anything from inside a pipenv shell. This is a convenience function for people who really need subshells." If I understand correctly that means I should always be using pipenv run instead of pipenv shell. Unfortunately neither pipenv run -h nor pipenv run --help tells you how to use the run command, which is rather frustrating. And other commands such as pipenv install tell you to activate the pipenv shell at the end of the output, which makes it sound like the advice I quoted above is just wrong.
All of which is to say that I'm really confused and having more info in the "Basic Usage" document would be super helpful :)
