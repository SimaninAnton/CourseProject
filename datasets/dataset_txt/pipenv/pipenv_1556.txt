Current Behavior
When running pipenv run in a directory that does not have a virtualenv yet, that virtualenv is automatically generated. But the packages are not installed.
Expected Behavior
When a virtualenv is not yet initialized for a project, I would expect the pipenv run command to either do nothing, or to create both the virtualenv and install the dependencies.
Maybe there are edge cases I haven't thought of yet though?
