pipenv fails trims the -2 off the end of the version for functools32 resulting in the following error:
An error occured while installing!
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement functools32==3.2.3 (from -r /var/folders/hh/1yl543hs1cvdqtt2kl5z6m280000gn/T/tmpXl2UKq-requirements.txt (line 34)) (from versions: 3.2.3.post1, 3.2.3.post2)
No matching distribution found for functools32==3.2.3 (from -r /var/folders/hh/1yl543hs1cvdqtt2kl5z6m280000gn/T/tmpXl2UKq-requirements.txt (line 34))
when searching for the package with pip
$ pip search functools32
functools32 (3.2.3-2)  - Backport of the functools module from Python 3.2.3 for use on 2.7 and PyPy.
In the lock file
        "functools32": {
            "version": "==3.2.3"
        },
To reproduce the issue:
$ echo "functools32" > requirements.txt ;
$ pipenv install
This works fine:
$ echo "functools32==3.2.3-2" > requirements.txt ;
$ pipenv install
