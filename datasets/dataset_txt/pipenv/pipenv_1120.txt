Custom private indexes no longer seem to be honored as of version 11.10.0 (and is still present in 11.10.1). Downgrading back to 11.9.0 resolves the issue.
The specific package causing me trouble is grpcio~=1.10.0. Our private repository has 1.10.0 but 1.10.1 from pypi is being preferred.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
grpcio==1.10.0 to be installed from our private index.
Actual result
grpcio==1.10.1 is installed from pypi.
See https://gist.github.com/seglberg/7425c0bee2cb17fefa00397badaf889e for pipenv install --verbose output.
