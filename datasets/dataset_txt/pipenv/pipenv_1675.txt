Be sure to check the existing issues, both open and closed.
I want pipenv to recognize the .env in my directory. Rather when I type pipenv shell, it goes off and creates a new env.
Describe your environment
Windows 10 (Surface Pro)
Python version: python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
Uses existing environment (.env)
Actual result
Creates a new environment, in C:\User\matt\.virtualenvs\labs-FF_PAFzP
Steps to replicate
Install Python
Install pipenv in user installation
Create a virtual environment in the current directory named .env
Run pipenv shell
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
