it seems as though the launch into a new shell causes a weird history chain.
For example:
$ pip
-bash: fab: command not found
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl+D' to return.
$ history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
500  history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
$ exit
exit
$ history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
 1406  fab
 1408  history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl+D' to return.
$ history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
  497  history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
  500  history | tail -n 5 | grep fab
