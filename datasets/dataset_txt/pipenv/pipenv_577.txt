Issue description
I recently upgraded to the latest pipenv 2018.10.9 and immediately started getting install failures on pipenv install. Failures only seem to affect git subdirectory commands i.e.
{editable = true, git = "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/<org>/<repo>.git", ref="master", subdirectory="modules/<pkg>/"}
The repo is organised as a namespaced repo of subpackages. i.e modules//
Expected result
Describe what you expected.
Actual result
I dont have a traceback currently because I uninstalled to workaround before reporting. But the general result is it attempts to install from the root directory and fails when it does not find a setup.py.
Steps to replicate
Upgrade to pipenv 2018.10.9
Run pipenv install, ensuring you use a namespace packaged repo as above.
