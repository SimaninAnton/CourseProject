Hi,
This might be a slightly silly question, but... your readme says at the very top "Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.". But then in the Installation section https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation there are no installation instructions for Windows? "Otherwise, refer to the documentation for instructions.": Even if I click on this docs link https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today I am still unable to read any installation instructions for Windows on that website?
Kind of makes me strongly question the "Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.", or is there some sarcasm that I fail to see? :-)
Thanks!
