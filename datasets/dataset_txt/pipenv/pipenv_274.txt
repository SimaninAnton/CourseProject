Issue description
Pipfile.lock "development" section seems appears to include transitive dependencies which are redundant, yet often have different versions than "default" dependencies.
I've confirmed that these redundant dependencies are not needed. (E.g. if a package is only listed as dependency in "default' of Pipfile.lock, and you do a pipenv sync --dev, it will get installed.)
Expected result
Given that --dev implies default + dev dependencies, I don't expect there to be dependencies duplicated between the default and dev sections of Pipfile.lock. Moreover it's confusing to see contradicting versions specified for the same package within the Pipfile.lock.
Actual result
"development" section of Pipfile.lock contains transitive dependencies which are redundant and often different than "default' section.
