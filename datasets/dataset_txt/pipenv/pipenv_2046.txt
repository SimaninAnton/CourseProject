pipenv graph currently displays the dependency graph for everything visible in the environment, including the contents of system site-packages.
I'm working around that by doing:
$ pew toggleglobalsitepackages
Disabled global site-packages
$ pipenv graph
...
$ pew toggleglobalsitepackages
Enabled global site-packages
I'm wondering if it may make more sense to just always restrict the top level graph entries to items listed in Pipfile, and have two separate sections at the end for:
additional local packages (included in pip list --local, but not in Pipfile.lock)
additional global packages (included in pip list, but not in pip list --local)
I'm also thinking it would be reasonable to just not show the global packages at all - when we turn that option on, we usually know why we're doing it.
