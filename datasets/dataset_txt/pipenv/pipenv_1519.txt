When package format is file such as flask-admin = {file = "https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/archive/2c2c98e.zip"}, it's dependency can not be updated to Pipfile.lock correctly. For above example, wtform is obvious a dependendy of flask-admin and one can also check it by pipenv graph, but it is not pinned in Pipfile.lock and then it won't be installed by pipenv install.
