Currently, pipenv automatically reads the .env file when running either pipenv run or pipenv shell. It would be nice to have a way to prevent it from doing this. I know I can just do PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=.fake but it seems a little hacky.
Moreover, when I edit the .env file inside a pipenv shell. I have to deactivate and activate the environment again for the changes to take place.
Environment
OS Type: OSX
Python version: 3.6.2
Pipenv version: 8.3.1
Expected Result
It would be nice to have a flag to make pipenv not automatically load the .env file. Also, it would be helpful to have a command to reload the .env file.
