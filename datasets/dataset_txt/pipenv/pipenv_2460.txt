Hello, i have noticed that pipenv creates virtualenv in new directory, which is highly unacceptable for our company, because of our project deployment tools are targeting .venv in project directory. How do we configure that? Also, hiding virtualenv on .local/share/virtualenv looks like bad practice:
you never know if virtualenv you need exists
system gets polluted with different virtualenvs
you now need to manually handle virtualenvs
it is harder to work with if you need to recreate virtualenv manually — this is just not obvious.
Virtualenv location: /home/asyncee/.local/share/virtualenvs/project
And secondly, i get this error after running pipenv shell:
Spawning environment shell (/bin/zsh).
ERROR: The virtualenv hasn't been activated correctly.
Either the env is corrupted (try running `pew restore env`),
Or an upgrade of your Python version broke your env,
Or check the contents of your $PATH. You might be adding new directories to it
from inside your shell's configuration file.
In this case, for further details please see: https://github.com/berdario/pew#the-environment-doesnt-seem-to-be-activated
Yesterday (before new location) everything was working fine — my python installation did not change.
