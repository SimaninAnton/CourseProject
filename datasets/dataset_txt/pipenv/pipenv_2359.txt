I want to have django 1.x in my project because the 2.x release could break things. I can't find any docs on how to do this. I tried pipenv install django<=2.* or pipenv install django=='<2.*' but it doesn't work.
pipenv install django==1.* seems to work but my Pipfile then has the line Django = "==1.*" which looks wrong.
Any docs on this would be nice.
