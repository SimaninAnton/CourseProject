Heard about this in the talkpython interview, excited to start using it but I've run into a problem with an 'Inappropriate ioctl for device' message when trying to use pipenv to install dependencies in a vagrant shell provisioning script. I'm fairly sure this is because there's no terminal and is related to #199 - running pipenv in a terminal via vagrant ssh works just fine.
The solution in that issue doesn't seem to have made it's way out yet though? I'm running version 5.1.1.
