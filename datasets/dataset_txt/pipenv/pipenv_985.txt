When running pipenv install, I see the following output:
⊙  pipenv install                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Julian@Macnetic ●
Warning: Your Pipfile requires python_version pypy, but you are using 2.7.13 (/Users/Julian/L/A/v/M/bin/python).
...
But that path is clearly the truncated version of some real path (which I can make an educated guess is ~/Library/Application\ Support/virtualenvs/<myapp>/bin/python), but it's unhelpful to show an artificially truncated path.
