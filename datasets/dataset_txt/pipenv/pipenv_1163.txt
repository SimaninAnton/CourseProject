pipenv is a fabulous tool, something Python's been missing for years. Are there any plans to bundle pipenv with future releases of Python 3 similar to how pip is bundled? This would make using pipenv that much easier for users and also reinforce that this is the official tool for the job.
Is pipenv still relatively unstable, and that is part of the reason not to bundle?
It would be great to have pipenv always available similar to how Rust comes with cargo out of the box.
