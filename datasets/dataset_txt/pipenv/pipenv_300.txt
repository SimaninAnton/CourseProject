Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I would like to ask you if is it possible to change your decision
Always store exact commit in the lockfile
from #2209 for case when VCS requirement uses branch. I think it could be handy for development. For example, in our team we set branch for VCS requirement when we develop some new feature. When the feature is done we release it and in our project we set the tag or in some cases we set the specific commit.
Describe the solution you'd like
I think it should respect passed ref in Pipfile.lock when installing package:
pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@update-3.0#egg=requests should keep update-3.0 branch in ref.
And pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@190a68550ac2172d9651470558f90cb6b754d065#egg=requests should keep 190a68550ac2172d9651470558f90cb6b754d065 hash commit in ref.
$ pipenv --support
