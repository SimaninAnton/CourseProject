Hello, currently if I need to specify a version of pkg in pipfile, I need to use the ==
[packages]
Quart = "*"
Flask = "*"
Flask-Bootstrap = "*"
PyYAML = "*"
dictor = "*"
loguru = "*"
salt = "==2018.3.3"
tinydb = "*"
this messes up a lot of syntax coloring in IDEs and is generally confusing since theres already a "=" char prior to the double ==
why not have it be specified like this, w/o the use of double ==
salt = "2018.3.3"
Is there a reason to use the double ==
