Was working on Pipenv and got an ImportError when I do pipenv run .... Took me a minute to realise “oh yeah there’s a new dependency, I need to pipenv sync”.
It would be pretty neat if Pipenv can tell me something like
$ pipenv run ...
Notice: Your environment is out of sync to Pipfile.lock. Run pipenv sync or pipenv sync --dev to update!
[Attempt to run the script anyway]
I’m not sure if this is even feasible, but it would be a very-nice-to-have.
