Issue description
Hello folks, I created a simple package for demonstration purposes and included some data with the package_data directive (in my setup.py). The package was working fine both on linux and Mac, but wasn't copying over the data files on Windows. I fixed it by including a MAINFEST.in file and an __init__.py file in my directory. But the standard solution wasn't working fine.
Here's the code: https://github.com/santiagobasulto/party-parrot/tree/0.0.2
I've fixed my command in 0.0.3 with the above mentioned hack, so use 0.0.2 for testing.
Expected result
To copy the data and work well like in Linux and Mac.
Actual result
Data files were not copied.
Steps to replicate
Using windows:
$ pipenv install party-parrot==0.0.2  # this version is the one with issues
$ pipenv shell
$ party
(this works with party-parrot@0.0.3 but not with party-parrot@0.0.2.
