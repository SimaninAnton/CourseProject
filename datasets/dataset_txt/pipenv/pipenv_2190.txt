Is there a way to specify in the Pipfile that the package (for which the Pipfile is being defined) itself shoud be installed inside the virtualenv, preferably as editable? I.e. basically running pip install --editable . in the directory where setup.py is stored.
This is useful for development e.g. in cases where you have subpackages and run afoul of the limitations of relative imports.
On the other hand, I realize it goes against the reproducible guarantees of Pipfile.lock, since such a package can't be pinned down to a specific version.
