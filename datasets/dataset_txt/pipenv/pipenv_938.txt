When the "python_version" in a Pipfile changes I get warnings but i manually have to run pipenv install --python X.X.
My understanding of the idea of pipenv is, that running pipenv update will sync my virtualenv with my Pipfile (without need for manual interaction). Thus: why is this not the case for changing the python version.
