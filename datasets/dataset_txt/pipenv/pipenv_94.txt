Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Pipenv is slow to start even with no arguments.
I had to remove this line from my .bashrc because I found it takes 2.7 secs to run, and it seems to be due to the fact that pipenv with no arguments takes 1.3 secs to start and print the help text.
eval "$(pipenv --completion)"
Describe the solution you'd like
Hoping this is low-hanging fruit. Perhaps this is an easy fix to move some of the initial configuration and setup to after some of the command line processing.
Describe alternatives you've considered

Additional context
Thanks! Pipenv is super useful; but it's become so important in my toolchain that subtle issues like this are a performance hit to my whole development cycle.
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
pipenv --support
Error: no such option: --support
pipenv --version
