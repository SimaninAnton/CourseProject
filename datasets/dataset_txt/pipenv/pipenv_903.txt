When starting a new project using pipenv with --pypi-mirror specified, virtualenv uses pip without respecting the --pypi-mirror setting.
If PyPI is inaccessible during this process, virtualenv falls back to using local copies of necessary packages and pipenv silently proceeds. However, if connections to PyPI time out (e.g. if packets are dropped instead of rejected by a firewall), pip (and virtualenv) will hang, and pipenv will timeout.
