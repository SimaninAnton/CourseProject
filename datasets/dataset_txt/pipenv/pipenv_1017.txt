Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
pipenv "hides" the virtualenv path and name, which leads to confusion and disorientation. Knowing this helps set up PyCharm IDE or simply activating the virutalenv directly from a command line.
Describe the solution you'd like
When creating the virtualenv, echo the path to the virtualenv to the console.
Have a pipenv command that echoes the full virtualenv path.
Have pipenv shell prefix the virtualenv name in the shell's command prompt the same way as if one were to activate the virtualenv directly. (I am using Windows here.)
Describe alternatives you've considered
In general, I have found it less confusing to work directly in the virtualenv rather than using pipenv shell, partly because the virtualenv prefix on the command prompt tells reassures me of my current Python environment.
