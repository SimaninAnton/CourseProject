When installing pytest via an imported requirements.txt on Python2, the extra requirement of funcsigs is not installed.
Describe your environment
OS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.2
Python version: 2.7.13
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
funcsigs should be installed
Actual result
funcsigs is not installed
Steps to replicate
cd $(mktemp -d)
echo pytest > requirements.txt
pipenv --two install -r requirements.txt
When running pipenv graph the output shows that funcsigs is a dependency, but no version is installed: funcsigs [required: Any, installed: ?].
Note that using the command pipenv --two install pytest to install pytest directly instead of via a requirements.txt file installs funcsigs as expected. The dependency is specified in pytest here.
