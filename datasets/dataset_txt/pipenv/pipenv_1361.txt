Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!).
This looks like the same issue as #1707, which says that 11.6.3 fixes the issue. But I'm seeing it with 11.6.7.
When attempting to run pipenv lock, I'm getting an SSLError "No such file or directory". Full stack trace below (I ran pipenv lock -v to get the full set of stack traces, but omitted the resolution output, which seemed to work fine).
I tried the workaround listed in #1707 (pip install certifi) with no luck ("Requirement already satisfied" and no change in behavior).
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Pipenv version: `'11.6.7'`
Expected result
I expected the pipenv lock command to complete successfully.
Actual result
Full Stack Trace
Traceback (most recent call last): File "c:\\python36\\lib\\site-packages\\pipenv\..\pipenv\vendor\requests\packages\urllib3\util\ssl_.py", line 295, in ssl_wrap_socket context.load_verify_locations(ca_certs, ca_cert_dir) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory



































Steps to replicate
Using Pipfile from above details, run pipenv.lock. There is a private git dependency in there; that one can be safely omitted from the Pipfile and the error will still occur.
