Describe the solution you'd like
I assume most people are migrated from virtualenv to pipenv. I think these people's habit is building up their env under the project folder.
So I suggest could you please create a new directory for building up env under current folder, such as "pipenv -local install" instead of using local variable to control it..
Additionally, people need to learn some packages simultaneously when they write their own code. So restore env folder in a system folder is not quite convenient.
Thank you for making this fantastic tool.
Thanks a lot for considering this issue.
Best regards
