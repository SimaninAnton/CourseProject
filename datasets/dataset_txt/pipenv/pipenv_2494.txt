I would like to be able to use pipenv run as part of my automation tooling, but currently it adds about a second of overhead on my machine:
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 3.2.4

$ time .venv/bin/python --version
Python 3.6.0
.venv/bin/python --version  0.00s user 0.00s system 28% cpu 0.020 total

$ time pipenv run python --version
Python 3.6.0
pipenv run python --version  1.03s user 0.20s system 36% cpu 3.399 total
While one second is not long, it is enough to discourage me from using pyenv as a task runner for tests, linters, etc.
Can anything be done about this overhead?
