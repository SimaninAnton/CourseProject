Running pipenv shell from (Administrator) command prompt in Windows 10 Pro to launch virtual environment outputs:
UNC paths are not supported. Defaulting to Windows directory.
when run from within a mapped network drive.
The virtual environment does not show up in () before the drive. (If I am in the virtual environment at this point, it is easy to forget that I am and I could forget to exit out. Moreover, it doesn't show which environment I'm in).
If I type activate afterwards, the environment in () shows up, but I don't have to be in the folder where Pipfile or Pipfile.lock are located.
Is this expected behavior?
Is this somehow a holdover from virtualenv's or virtualenvwrapper's ability to utilize UNC paths?
