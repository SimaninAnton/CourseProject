Currently, all the options of Pipenv commands are taken as flags. This is pretty cool for most cases, but there are some cases where one might prefer to have configuration from environment variables:
When using in a build system
For example, let's say that you have a Dockerfile, which when built with DEBUG=1 or similar will tell pipenv to install --dev dependencies, while normally it would not
When using the same option in multiple commands
For example, let's say that for some reason I want to work using the system installation, I have to use --system in every command
If this is something we would like to see included, I could draft a PR with variables being PIPENV_*, ie PIPENV_SYSTEM. This should be fairly easy since the project is using click.
