My understanding is that Pipfile supports the ability to install many categories of packages with the default being [packages] and [dev-packages]. Is there a way using pipenv to install to a custom group and install all of the packages under a custom group?
Example implementation if this is not already implemented could be:
pipenv install requests --custom test to install the requests package under [test-packages]
pipenv install --custom test to install all packages under [test-packages]
