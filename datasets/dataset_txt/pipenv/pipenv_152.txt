In some cases, pip can prompt for a password when setup with an alternate package registry. When that happens, pipenv install appears to hang: pip is waiting for the user to enter the password, but there's no sign of that on the terminal because pipenv captures pip's output.
Setting stdin to /dev/null (instead of PIPE) would at least cause pip to exit and then pipenv would show an error to the user, which would lead to faster diagnosis of the problem, and would not harm anything when pip doesn't need user input. I can submit a pull request if this change is ok. Thanks!
