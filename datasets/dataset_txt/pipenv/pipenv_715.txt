Issue description
I'm on a Mac and installed pre-commit using brew and without even asking for it got upgraded from python 3.6.5 to 3.7. (3.6.5 was also under the control of brew)
Now pipenv fails with "Library not loaded"-error.
Expected result
Pipenv to work as before the python upgrade.
Actual result
$ pipenv -h
dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../.Python
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/pipenv/2018.5.18/libexec/bin/python3.6
  Reason: image not found
Abort trap: 6
Comments
What's the proper way of fixing the issue? Can I edit some config-file to point to 3.7 instead?
Could pipenv perhaps be more lenient and rely on the python3 binary instead of the python3.6?
