[First of all, this might really be two issues in one. Apologies if so.]
If I use pipenv to install django==2.0.2 and subsequently try to install django-registration, then:
a) django-registration isn't installed. A fragment of the error message is: "Could not find a version that matches django!=1.9.*,<2.0,==2.0.2,>=1.8"; among the versions tried is 2.0.2 (listed twice). My read of this is that it should be installable.
b) Pipfile.lock is deleted.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: Python 3.5.2 (also reproduced with a pyenv-managed 3.6.1)
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
a) django-registration should be installed successfully
b) if django-registration can't be installed (I could well be misreading the error message), then Pipfile.lock shouldn't removed, and should probably remain as-is.
Actual result
a) django-registration not installed
b) Pipfile.lock deleted
I put a very verbose session in https://gist.github.com/maw/83f72224cf574f85fbad108e0d622124. Starting from a base OS image is probably overkill, but I've run into some issues involving pyenv. I don't think they're at play here, but I felt it better to eliminate that variable anyway. The shorter version is in the next section.
Steps to replicate
mkdir tacos
cd tacos
pipenv install django==2.0.2
ls
pipenv install django-registration
ls
