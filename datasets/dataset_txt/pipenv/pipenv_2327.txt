Running pipenv install after changing one dependency takes about ~5 minutes for me, on a windows 10 machine with an SSD.
The vast majority of that time is spent inside Locking [packages] dependencies...
It seems like there might be some quadratic-or-worse complexity in this step?
I've included most of our pipfile below, but I had to remove some of our private repo dependencies:
