pipenv uses "bright white" (bold white) liberally for emphasis, which is unreadable if one's terminal has a white background, turning important warnings into some sort of mad libs:
it should instead use the escape code for bold, without specifiying a colour:
>>> print("Your \033[1mPipfile\033[m now contains pinned versions")
