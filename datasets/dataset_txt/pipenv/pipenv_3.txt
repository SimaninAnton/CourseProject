Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
As discussed on Twitter with Kenneth [1], Pipenv could speed up the locking process by not downloading artifacts. Instead, it could use hashvalues exposed by a Python index as described in PEP-503:
The URL SHOULD include a hash in the form of a URL fragment with the following syntax: #=, where is the lowercase name of the hash function (such as sha256) and is the hex encoded digest.
If hashvalues are not exposed (e.g. private repositories), hashvalues can be computed by downloading artifacts as its donw now (fallback scenario).

Describe the solution you'd like
Pipenv could use exposed hashvalues not to download artifacts on each locking.
Describe alternatives you've considered
The current solution - download and compute hashes of artifacts each time during locking.
