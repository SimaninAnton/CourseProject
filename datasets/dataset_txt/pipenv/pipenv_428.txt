Issue description
pipenv install --skip-lock will read a Pipfile.lock if it exists which is unintuitive.
For example
Expected result
Pipenv ignores Pipfile.lock altogether and just installs dependencies specified in the Pipefile
Actual result
my actual use case output
You see it claims to be installing from Pipfile however it's reaching for hashes it shouldn't
know about. The reason is this line here
pipenv/pipenv/core.py
Line 780 in 9a6443a
 lockfile = project.get_or_create_lockfile() 
the method being called there will load the lockfile if it exists, this is probably ok, except
when --skip-lock is explicitly true this unintuitive
Steps to replicate
See above.
or
contrived example
You see there is a difference in number of dependencies
$ pipenv --support
