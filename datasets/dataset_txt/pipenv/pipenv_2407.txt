It appears that honcho (https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho) does not work with pipenv run.
Here is the example:
[jonathan]: docker run -it test /bin/bash                                                                                            [~/src/consulting/eoch/test]:master
root@6047f1099378:/app# pipenv run honcho start
20:13:56 system               | server.1 started (pid=16)
20:13:56 server.1             | /bin/sh: 1: gunicorn: not found
20:13:56 system               | server.1 stopped (rc=127)
pip shell & honcho start works, but I'm not sure how to do that not interactively
To clarify -- I have installed gunicorn properly, as it works via shell.
