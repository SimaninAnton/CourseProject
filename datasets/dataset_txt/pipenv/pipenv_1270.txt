There is something wrong with the call to resolve_deps here: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/pipenv/resolver.py#L56
Please, check the function definition here: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/pipenv/utils.py#L394
I am not sure what is the fix though and can't propose a change.
Thank you!
