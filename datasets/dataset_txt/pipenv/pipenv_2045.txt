When using the --site-packages option, PIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED can be useful to make sure that any pip-installable dependencies actually are installed into the virtual environment, with the system site-packages then being used only to resolve imports that aren't covered by the Python level dependency graph at all (with my current use case for that being Fedora's Python bindings for DNF and libsolv).
I was mainly writing an issue instead of a PR in order to ask where the appropriate place in the docs to add this would be. I'm currently thinking a new "Relying on platform-provided Python components" section at the end of https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/blob/master/docs/advanced.rst might work.
