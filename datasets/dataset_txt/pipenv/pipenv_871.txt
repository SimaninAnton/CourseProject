Issue description
When running on CircleCI pipenv times out, stuck on Cleaning up...
Expected result
It finishes installing
Actual result
It times out after 10 minutes (CCI exits):
$ pipenv sync --dev --verbose
Steps to replicate
Not sure, when I enter debug build with ssh enabled and try the same pipenv commands it doesn't hang like I've presented above.
$ pipenv --support
