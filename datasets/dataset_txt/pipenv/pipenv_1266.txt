Hello,
I'm currently packaging pipenv for Debian and I wonder what's the purpose of the vendor directory and its contents? I understand the purpose of patched but shouldn't pipenv rather depend on those packages in vendor (e.g. via install_requires in setup py) than providing them?
From a packaging point of view this is also very hard as I'll probably have to un-bundle the vendor packages one by one and make pipenv depend on the corresponding Debian packages.
Assuming the packages in vendor are unpatched, would you accept pull requests that try to un-bundle those packages in vendor?
