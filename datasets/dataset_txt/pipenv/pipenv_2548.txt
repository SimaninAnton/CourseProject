For bash shell, when I try activating virtualenv by pip shell, it doesn't prepend virtualenv name before bash prompt.
$ # Global pip
$ pip freeze | wc -l
61
$ pipenv shell
Spawning environment shell (/bin/bash).
$ pip freeze
$ # Means we are inside virtualenv as there is no package
$ which python
/XXXXXX/.venv/bin/python
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(playpipenv) $ 
It might be my bashrc. Will wait till anyone confirms it. Thanks
