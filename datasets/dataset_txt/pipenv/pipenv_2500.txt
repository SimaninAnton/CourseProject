Every time the Pipfile is changed the Pipfile section arrangement might, too. Which is a pain if you have to review such changes. Especially if it's the case for Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.
I'm not very familiar with TOML and the Python package used but maybe it's possible to preserve the order when writing to the Pipfile? (Using OrderedDicts internally or something).
TODO (this section by Kenneth Reitz)
determine if TOML library supports dumping OrderedDicts.
determine if TOML library supports loading OrderedDicts.
implement preserve order in Pipfile
implement preserve order in Pipfile.lock
