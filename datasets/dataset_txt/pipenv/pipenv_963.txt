Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It is always time-consuming to create a basic setup.py file to upload the package to PyPI.
Describe the solution you'd like
Just as the npm init command, we can have an option to ask the user for basic information about the project and then create a setup.py file, with minimal attributes, ready to be used.
Additional context
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init
NOTE: I'm proficient enough to work on this if the idea is considered for implementation.
