I use following command to build my dockerfile. I create virtualenv myself, cause I donot want a random-name virtualenv. but the pipenv lock seems create a virtualenv on somewhere, which was not expected.
from python:3.6.5-slim
....
RUN pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt && /venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
it logs like following:
Creating a virtualenv for this project…
Using /usr/local/bin/python3.6m (3.6.5) to create virtualenv…
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/local/bin/python3.6m
Using base prefix '/usr/local'
New python executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/server-Fk8nPUz7/bin/python3.6m
Also creating executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/server-Fk8nPUz7/bin/python
how to not create a virtualenv while generate a requirements.txt.
and the pipenv lock -r run very slow, I have pipenv.lock in projects, but it seems not use it directly.
