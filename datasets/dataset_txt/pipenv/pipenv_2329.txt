For example, if the pipfile specifies a dependency with version <=2.5.1, while the same package also occurs as a transitive dependency with version >=2.6.0, then both pipfile and pipfile.lock will agree that the version is 2.5.1, but it will silently install 2.6.0 in the virtualenv, without showing any warnings or errors about the conflicting requirements.
