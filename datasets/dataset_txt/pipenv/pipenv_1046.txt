This was a weird one and it was so odd that I thought I was losing my mind for a bit. ;-) Thanks for pipenv though, I'm very excited about this new direction!
Pipenv installs requirements.txt when you don't ask it to, and when it try to keep it from installing them, it still does. This is on Windows 10. Not sure if reproduces on Linux\OSx
$ python -m pipenv.help
$ python -m pipenv.help output
------------
Expected result
pipenv install should NOT install anything else other than library & dependencies.
pipenv install should not install requirements.txt when requirements.txt has been moved (from the repro and not commited)
Actual result
pipenv installs requirements.txt when it exists and its not asked to.
pipenv installs requirement.txt when it is deleted and the change is not commited to the repro
When possible, provide the verbose output (--verbose), especially for locking and dependencies resolving issues.
Steps to replicate
Git init new_repro
Create requirements.txt and add a library (nflgame==1.2.20 for example)
Don't pip install or pipenv install anything at this point.
4.. Add and Commit requirements.txt to the repro
move requirements.txt out of the repro.
.6 pipenv install some other library (pipenv install requests)
The library in the requirements.txt is installed
