Hi,
It seems that since 7.4.3 and concurrency pipenv will create a process for each package to download. My PIpfile.lock has 122 packages, so when I run pipenv install --dev it crashes my computer.
Would it be possible to limit the number of concurrent package to install at the same time? Possibly with a shell argument.
Thank you
