I installed pipenv as a test, and, until now, I was using virtualenvwrapper to manage my venvs. For some reason, pipenv couldn't open a shell apparently because of virtualenvwrapper, though I'm not 100% sure.
Here's the gist:

Besides pipenv not entering the shell, now every time (even after uninstalling and reinstalling virtualenvwrapper and uninstalling pipenv) I workon and deactivate a virtualenv, it shows some errors on the console, and I don't know how to fix those.
Here's a gist with the errors:
