hello
i'm trying to use twint and at the end of installation when i start to use pipenv i have this error
pipenv.patched.notpip._internal.exceptions.UnsupportedPythonVersion: twint requires Python '>=3.6.0' but the running Python is 2.7.17
i check out my python version and the output are here:
user@kali:~/twint$ python2 --version
Python 2.7.17
user@kali:~/twint$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.5
even i try to istall as root user but at the end pipenv command show this error:
Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  First try clearing your dependency cache with $ pipenv lock --clear, then try the original command again.
 Alternatively, you can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
  Hint: try $ pipenv lock --pre if it is a pre-release dependency.
ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches 3-6-3
No versions found
