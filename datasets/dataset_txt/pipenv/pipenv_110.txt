I installed new python3.7.4 amd64 into Windows 10 Home OS
And installed pipenv by pip install pipenv
But when I was initializing my python projects with pipenv update command (pipenv install also tried). The command screen shows creating virtualenv and keeping creating huge number of sub process until the system got out of memory or just crashed.

As this image shows, the number of subprocess is increasing very fast until took down all CPU and Memory resources but did nothing. I cannot even init a new project. I don't know if there were any mistake.
