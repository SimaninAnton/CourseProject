I'm working on adding Pipfile support for Sublime/Anaconda. Right now, I need to make two separate subprocess calls for pipenv, to check if --venv is installed and run --py afterwards.

This is required, because if venv is not installed --py doesn't give any warning, just returns the system interpreter. I don't know if there is any reason behind this, or it's just a bug, bug I guess it's just a bug, as normally --py gives an error, like when run in a dir without Pipfile ("No project found!").
Can you change the behaviour of --py to give the same error as --venv gives?
