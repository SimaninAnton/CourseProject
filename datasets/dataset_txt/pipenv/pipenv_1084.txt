Scripts should allow multiple shell commands to be run as one "script". Both Yarn and npm allow this. Currently, if you try to do this:
[scripts]
foo = "echo 'bar' && echo 'baz'"
it will result in bar && echo baz. You can sidestep this issue by doing something like
[scripts]
foo = "bash -c \"echo 'bar' && echo 'baz'\""
but
that's a bit inconvenient
it isn't a cross-platform solution (it won't work on Windows)
The use case that I have is running coverage report after running coverage, but it's definitely something that would have many general uses.
Expected result
Running pipenv run foo should result in:
bar
baz
Actual result
Running pipenv run foo results in:
bar && echo baz
Steps to replicate
Create a Pipfile with the following:
[scripts]
foo = "bash -c \"echo 'bar' && echo 'baz'\""
