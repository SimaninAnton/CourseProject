Running pipenv lock --keep-outdated when a dependency with extras has changed in the Pipfile doesn't update the Pipfile.lock.
Steps to replicate:
Use these initial files:
Pipfile
Pipfile.lock

Edit the raven declaration in the Pipfile to read raven = {extras = ["flask"], version = "==6.7.0"} and run pipenv lock --keep-outdated. The version of raven in the Pipfile.lock will not have updated.
The behaviour works as expected for dependencies with a string version - editing the Pipfile to read raven = "==6.7.0" and running pipenv lock --keep-outdated updates the lockfile as expected.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
