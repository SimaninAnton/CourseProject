It is just my suggestion to add watch feature in pipenv that resembles npm watch, npm watch makes you able to run some scripts whenever you save for files after a change.
One of the use cases of this feature might be to run all your unit tests whenever you make changes to your files, thus giving you instant feedback about your changes.
And another use case could be to run static code analysis on your codebase whenever you make changes to your files.
I have been using pipenv for a while and I think this is a good feature for pipenv.
