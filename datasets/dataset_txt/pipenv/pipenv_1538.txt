It is possible to specify dependencies inside the Pipfile that are installed from conda instead of pypi?
Somethink like this:
[[source]]
url = 'https://pypi.python.org/simple'
verify_ssl = true
name = 'pypi'

[[source]]
url = 'https://repo.continuum.io/...'
verify_ssl = true
name = 'conda'
When I set up a new computer I install anaconda, then install some packages with conda install (e.g. numpy, scipy, cython, ...) and the remaining ones I install with pip install.
I was able to get pipenv working with conda but I do not know how I can define the dependencies from conda (Or if it is possible). Searching for an answer to my question I can only find people that mention that conda does not work with pipenv.
