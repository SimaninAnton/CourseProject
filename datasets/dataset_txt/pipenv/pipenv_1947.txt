Motivation
Currently having minor issues using pipenv install as part of a Dockerfile, and being unable to get the virtualenv folder location programatically. ( Well I can but it's a bit meh)
The virtualenv folder name is returned by the virtualenv_name method property at https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/blob/master/pipenv/project.py#L116
Currently I'm using ENV VIRTUALENV_PATH="$(pipenv --venv)" in my Dockerfile, but this seems messy.
Should there be an option to set an explicit virtualenv directory name?
Proposal
I propose a --virtualenv-name command line argument and a PIPENV_VIRTUALENV_NAME environment variable.
