Issue description
Using the --skip-lock flag with pipenv uninstall results in :
Error: no such option: --skip-lock
Although the documentation states that:
$ pipenv uninstall supports all of the parameters in pipenv install, [...]
(therefore including --skip-lock)
Obviously, this can be a simple documentation fix, but it would be more interesting to add the skip-lock flag to pipenv uninstall. This is interesting for CI environments, where you might want to drop a package temporarily and don't care about locking the dependencies (that takes a significant amount of times, > 7 mins in my env). In one word: speedup.
