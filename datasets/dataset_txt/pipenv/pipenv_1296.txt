Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!).
I'd like to use a pyenv installed version of miniconda as my virtualenv python.
ala: pipenv --python miniconda3-4.3.30
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
I expect that I would get an virtual environment build that matches the specified python.
for example when I ask for a 2.7 python.
 $ pipenv --python 2.7

Actual result
Actual result, is that it can't find the installed miniconda python, asks if I would like to install it, and then says it can't find it on my path.
$ pipenv --python miniconda3-4.3.30
