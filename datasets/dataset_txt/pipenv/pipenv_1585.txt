When trying to install schedule pipenv suggests azure-mgmt-scheduler instead, even thought the package schedule exists on pypi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schedule).
$ pipenv install schedule
Did you mean azure-mgmt-scheduler? [Y/n]: 
Describe your environment

I expect it to install the specified package and not suggest another one.
