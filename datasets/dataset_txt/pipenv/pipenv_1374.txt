Hello. After update pipenv to 11.6.1 and call command pipenv install --dev, I had this warning message:
$ pipenv install --dev

Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
Could not find a version that matches django-debug-toolbar
