I'm trying to install a local django checkout as editable using pipenv, but the d is being ignored somewhere, so the install is failing.
$ pipenv install "-e ../djandgo"    
Installing -e ../jango…
Error:  An error occurred while installing -e ../jango!
Note that I've added an extra d in the middle to show that it's not the forward slash doing the editing. All ds are being removed.
While writing this bug report, I discovered how to make this work:
pipenv install -- "-e ../django"
Installing -e ../django…
Obtaining file:///Users/josh/dev/django
So it looks like pipenv is interpreting the text inside the string as options/args, but by passing -- we tell pipenv to ignore future options.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
pipenv to install django as an editable package from a sibling directory.
I tried using the entire alphabet to see if there was an issue with other letters, and the results are weird.
Actual result
Nothing was installed because the directory name is mangled.
