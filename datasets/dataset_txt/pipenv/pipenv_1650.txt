Chris Withers asked a good question over on distutils-sig: where would we like folks to ask usage questions about pipenv?
At the moment we don't have anything in the README about that, so the answer defaults to either the issue tracker here, or else to one of the general PyPA mailing lists (i.e. distutils-sig or pypa-dev). None of those are especially great options longer term.
My own suggestion would be to create a pipenv tag on Stack Overflow and keep an eye on that ourselves (I have the required SO rep to create a tag for us if we decide to go this way), rather than creating yet another general chat channel to monitor. SO also has the advantage of more readily scaling future support efforts beyond the active pipenv contributors.
@pypa/pipenv-committers: Thoughts? Other suggestions?
