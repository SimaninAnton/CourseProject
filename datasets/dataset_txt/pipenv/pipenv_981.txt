I am trying to disable tab completion for pipenv in fish, because filenames and paths are not completed when I do e.g. pipenv run py.test tests/test_<TAB>.
I suspect that it might have to do with this line specifically the -f flag to the complete-command.
However I can't figure out how the completion for pipenv is activated in the first place. There is no such configuration in my fish-config. Manually executing complete --command pipenv --erase disables completion for pipenv, but putting that in $XDG_CONFIG/fish/config.fish does not help. Somehow the completion is overridden again.
Could someone either give me hint as to why the completion of filenames and paths does not work for pipenv (is that actually intended or a bug?) or alternatively point out to me how the completion is activated at all, so I can go and disable it?
