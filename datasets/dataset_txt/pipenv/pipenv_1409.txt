I've started getting the above errors whenever I install packages with pipenv into a pipenv
created virtualenv.
I use the following command to install some base packages into each virtualenv:
❯ pipenv install --dev flake8 jedi importmagic epc autopep8 yapf pytest json-rpc service_factory autoflake hy isort bpython
Everytime I do, I get the warnings. It never used to be like that untill the recent homebrew python/python@2 updates. I don't know if it's got anything to do with it.
