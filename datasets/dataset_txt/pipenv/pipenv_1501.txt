Hi,
I've got little experience with pipenv, though I believe I'm getting some unexpected behaviour.
I'm using macOS 10.13.3 (17D102) and I used brew to install pipenv. I also have pyenv installed also via brew. The version informations are also in the attach screenshot.
I'm trying to make a new project and activate it's virtual environment in the shell. However, I'm unable to and get a UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIROMENT message. See screenshot.
Am I missing some additional configuration?
Thanks
