Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I want to add some scripts to the $PATH when running pipenv shell
Describe the solution you'd like
the resolved project root should be made available as an environment variables, so that scripts and the .env file can take advantage of that.
Describe alternatives you've considered
So far I am using $PWD in the .env file, but it will fail if the shell is activated from a different place that the project's root folder.
