Hello, I am trying to install pipenv on windows subsystem for linux,
But I get the following error message:
Current Pip version :
pip 10.0.0b2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pip-10.0.0b2-py3.5.egg/pip (python 3.5)
pipenv 11.9.0 has requirement pip>=9.0.1, but you'll have pip 10.0.0b2 which is incompatible.
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
pip3 install pipenv on 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
Release: 16.04
Codename: xenial
Thank you!
