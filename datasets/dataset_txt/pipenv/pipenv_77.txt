Feature Request!
Use Case
We currently pull some libraries we've created via git+ssh. This allows us to maintain a cheap "repo" of these libraries by leveraging git. We currently use this syntax in our Pipfile:
our-private-package = {editable = true,git = "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/our-org/python-our-private-package.git",ref = "v1.2.3"}
These repos leverage Git LFS to store large blobs of data for testing. This data is only used for tests and just adds bloat to our project using these libraries.
Desired Behavior
If we could have a flag to skip LFS download that would be ideal:
skip_lfs = true
our-private-package = {editable = true,git = "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/our-org/python-our-private-package.git",ref = "v1.2.3", skip_lfs = true}
Or something like that. That would help take down the package size from several hundred MB to a few KB.
Is there any other interest in this behavior? Am I missing a way to do this already? I did try searching around and didn't find anything quite like this.
Thanks,
