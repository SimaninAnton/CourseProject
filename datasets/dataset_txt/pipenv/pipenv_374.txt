For projects I want to share with others a requrnebnts fiel is the best common denominator. How can genearte a requrioemnst file which lists the top level non-dev packages?
I know
pipenv graph | grep "^[a-z]"
lists the top level packages, but it is a cumbersome manual task to filter out the dev packages from this. here.
$ pipenv --support
