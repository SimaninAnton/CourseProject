Not sure is it a bug or a feature. So correct me if this is a feature.
I have a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, then i do pipenv install uwsgi, pipenv installs uwsgi, add it to Pipfile and then updates Pipfile.lock. I expect that only uwsgi wil be added to Pipfile.lock. But pipenv add uwsgi and then updates whole Pipfile.lock, updating all packages to a newer versions. Is it expected behavior?
This happens on:
pipenv, version 2018.7.1
pipenv, version 9.0.1
