When activating pipenv shell at some folder in the repo with a Pipfile at root it will activate the shell and move you to the folder containing the Pipfile
Describe your environment
Linux/Mac OSX
Python 2.7.12
pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
Stay in the same directory as you were when running pipenv shell
Actual result
Directory is changed to the root of the repo
Steps to replicate
cd any number of levels deep into a repo with a Pipfile at the root
type pipenv shell
Observe that working directory is now changed to the same on that contains the Pipfile
