I am setting a new python project with pipenv. While installing packages, i got the following error.
I am using the 11.10.0 version of pipenv.
I think pipenv is picking up incomplete path. something similar to #1621
Command executed:
pipenv install [package]
Here is the log trace...
D:\Development\project>pipenv install request
