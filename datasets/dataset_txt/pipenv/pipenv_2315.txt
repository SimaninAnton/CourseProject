I've set my default shell to Fish:
$ grep $USER /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f 7
/usr/bin/fish
However, when I run pipenv shell, Bash is launched. Running pipenv shell -c doesn't seem to make a difference (although the prompt is now a bit different; I guess Bash itself must be 'misconfigured').
Also, I am running on in Windows Subsystem for Linux, if that makes any difference.
