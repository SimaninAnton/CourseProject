Issue description
Issue seems to revolve around resolving dependencys between these three libraries which according to there stated setup.py's should be compatible and install without issue with pip at these versions (i know that doesnt exactly mean there isnt an issue with the packages themselves potentially)
My assumption is something is weird with the graphql-core library and 1.1.0/1.1 is not being picked up correctly for some reason?
Thank you for any time you spend looking into this!
Expected result
pipenv install django==1.9 graphql-core==1.1 graphene==1.4 graphene-django==1.3
should lead to the packages
graphql-core==1.1
graphene==1.4
graphene-django==1.3
installing with the expected versions
Actual result
pipenv install
Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
  Hint: try $ pipenv lock --pre if it is a pre-release dependency.
