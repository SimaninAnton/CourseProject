tl;dr pipenv compares version strings differently if install parameter has version selection operator >=, e.g. >=4.0b vs. ==4.0b.
Running pipenv install 'pyyaml>=4.2b1' within a pipenv virtual environment fails with message Could not find a version that matches pyyaml>=4.2b1.
`pipenv install 'pyyaml>=4.2b1'` output

Yet pipenv install 'pyyaml==4.2b1' succeeds
`pipenv install 'pyyaml==4.2b1' output

Problems I see:
pipenv appears to behave differently for version selection operator >=
pipenv does not log the version it parsed. I don't know if pipenv parsed the passed version value as 4.2b1 or =4.2b1 or >=4.2b1 or something else.
Similar to Issue #3568 (and others).
