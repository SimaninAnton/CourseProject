pip._internal.exceptions.InstallationError: Directory '.' is not installable. File 'setup.py' not found.

Error:  An error occurred while installing -e .!
Directory '.' is not installable. File 'setup.py' not found.
I'm trying this with https://github.com/yrro/nexsan-exporter and definitely appreciative of the fact that there is a problem with my project rather than pipenv, nonetheless the error message needs some work; setup.py certainly exists!
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Project to be installed into the venv in editable mode.
Actual result
Error as above
Steps to replicate
Clone https://github.com/yrro/nexsan-exporter and run pipenv install -e .
