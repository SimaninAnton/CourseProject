Issue description
When I use pipenv to install Celery directly from the master branch on GitHub inside the official Pipenv Docker repository, the package cannot be imported. This is quite a problem right now, because there is no version of Celery that works in Python 3.7 that's published on PyPI as of writing this. Regardless of Celery, though, this error should be fixed for other packages too.
Expected result
I expected that the Celery package installed that way could be imported.
Actual result
Importing Celery outputs an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 1, in <module>
    import celery
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'celery'
Steps to replicate
I've created a minimal GitHub repository to show how to replicate this issue here. The full and detailed steps to replicate are in the repo's README.md
