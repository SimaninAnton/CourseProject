Right now creating a virtualenv with a custom version of Python is harder than it needs to be: check if you have it installed, if now find the proper way to install it for your OS, then proceed to choose between the exe/conda/ppa/deb/homebrew solution according to your need and the specific version you want, then install and create the virtualenv with the proper command.
pythonz allow you to easily install any Python version. Including legacy ones (2.6) and brand new ones (3.6). pew already integrates it. It would be great to be able to do:
pipenv install foo --python 3.6
And be done with it. It just check if Python 3.6 exists on my machine, and if not, use Pythonz to provide it in my env.
