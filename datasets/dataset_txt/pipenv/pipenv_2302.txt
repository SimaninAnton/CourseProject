Running pipenv, version 4.1.3
on Fedora using GNOME Terminal 3.22.1 Using VTE version 0.46.2 +GNUTLS
Pressing Ctrl + ] after running pipenv shell causes the virtual environment to exit.
This is quite problematic as use of vim's tags inside of the virtual env is quite impossible as Ctrl + ] is the default navigator for using tags.
I am more than happy to provide any additional information that would be helpful.
