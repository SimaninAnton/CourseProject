It would be nice to be able to run pipenv lock -r --no-hashes to generate the contents of requirements.txt without hashes.
It looks like support for this was removed recently. However, it is still a documented feature:
http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html
If you wish to produce a Pipfile.lock without hashes, you may also use pipenv lock --no-hashes.
This is the output in 6.2.4:
$ pipenv lock --no-hashes
Error: no such option: --no-hashes
