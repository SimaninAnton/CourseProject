I am trying to manage my repos with different PIPFILEs.
My first repo is using PIL version 6.0.0 and the other is using PIL version 5.4.1.
Is there a way to run a code from the first repo (with PIL 6.0.0), that when it is using the second repo code, it will use the second repo dependencies? I mean, using PIL 5.4.1 on modules from the second repo?
hope that I'm clear. Thanks
