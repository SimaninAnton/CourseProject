This is a duplicate of #210, but I want to resurface the issue with a broader scope.
The systems that I develop, test, and lock my dependencies on are different from the systems I deploy to so the Pipfile.lock committed to the repository will cause hash conflicts during deployment if any of my dependencies have changed.
For Heroku, my workaround is to the delete the Pipfile.lock in the "pre-compile" phase of deployment, but this completely nullifies the goal of having reproducible deployments.
