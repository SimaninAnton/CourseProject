I want to install pipenv under Ubuntu 18.04. When I do so, it breaks pip / pip3.
Expected result
Installed and working version of pipenv.
Actual result
pip / pip3 are broken, depending on whether I wanted to install pipenv though pip or pip3.
➜ pip
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main
Steps to replicate
Set up Ubuntu 18.04
Run pip install pipenv or pip3 install pipenv
Run pip or pip3 – the error is printed, and pip / pip3 do not work anymore.
In order to fix the issue I have to run:
sudo python -m pip uninstall pip && sudo apt install python-pip --reinstall
sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip && sudo apt install python3-pip --reinstall
But I cannot install pipenv using pip. Installation through apt does not work because there is no PPA available..
Solution
See the solution below; you need to have
export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH"
in your shell configuration. If the path is not there, it won't work.
