Issue description
I am unable to install package from a private gitlab repo via git+ssh. It works fine with pip but not with pipenv.
Example
This works fine, prompts me for passphrase and then downloads and installs mypackage:
pip install -e git+ssh://git@gitlab.mydomain.com/some/long/path/mypackage#egg=mypackage
This throws error:
pipenv install -e git+ssh://git@gitlab.mydomain.com/some/long/path/mypackage#egg=mypackage
Obtaining mypackage from git+ssh://git@gitlab.mydomain.com/some/long/path/mypackage#egg=mypackage
