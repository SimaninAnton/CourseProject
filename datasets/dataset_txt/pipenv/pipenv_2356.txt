Hey all,
I am working with a package that isn't in https://pypi.org/simple and when the CLI tries to proper_case(package_name) the package, my installation fails erroneously, as the package is in a different source that I have listed in my Pipfile. The error below:
Error:  Unable to find package <package-name> in PyPI repository.
Led me to the culprit. The proper_case function in the util module only statically checks the https://pypi.org/simple repo. It is not immediately obvious to me how to fix this, but it is not correct behavior.
