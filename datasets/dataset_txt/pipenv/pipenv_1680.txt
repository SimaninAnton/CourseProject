I am working on a Python package with pipenv and am faced with the challenge of keeping setup(install_requires=...) in sync with my Pipfile's runtime dependencies. Is there a recommended approach?
[Answer 2019-08-23] Best practise as also discussed below:
For applications that are deployed or distributed in installers, I just use Pipfile.
For applications that are distributed as packages with setup.py, I put all my dependencies in install_requires.
Then I make my Pipfile depend on setup.py by running pipenv install '-e .'.
