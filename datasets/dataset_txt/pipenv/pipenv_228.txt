Currently, when you do pipenv install somepackage all of the dependancies and the subdependancies get updated to the latest compatible version. Please provide an option to skip this update. Installing just one package takes seconds. Downloading and calculating hashes for hundreds of files take more than half an hour. I would like to do this update on my own schedule, separate from installing a package.
