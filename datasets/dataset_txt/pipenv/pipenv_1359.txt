I am a big fan of this project. I am working on getting my team to switch over to use it.
However, I worry that the pace of development seems to be a little out of control. I opened a PR to Homebrew to upgrade to 11.6.4 because 11.6.1 was completely broken for me and by the time I submitted it pipenv is already at 11.6.9!
Today may be an exceptionally patch-filled day, but a more slow-paced approach to planning/releasing features would be very welcomed by the humble user, I think.
