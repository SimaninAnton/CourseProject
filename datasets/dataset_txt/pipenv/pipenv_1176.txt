Describe the issue briefly here.
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling pipenv
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling pip
Running Windows 10, 64 bit
I have anaconda and pip installed on C drive (SSD).
My projects directory is on D drive (HD, more space)
I try to create a new virtual environment in my D:\projects directory:
cd d:\projects\myNewProject
pipenv install
This produces error:
> Pipfile.lock not found, creating…

I then follow directions and run: pipenv install --skip-lock

I'm not sure why pipenv can't install these dependencies and what specifically I need to do to get them installed.
============================================================
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
D:\projects\cs231n.github.io>python -m pipenv.help
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Expected a new pipenv virtual environment to be created for my new projeect
Actual result
Error message:
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement time (from -r C:\Users\Chris\AppData\Local\Temp\pipenv-sfeah4r9-requirements\pipenv-l0yoygj0-requirement.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for time (from -r C:\Users\Chris\AppData\Local\Temp\pipenv-sfeah4r9-requirements\pipenv-l0yoygj0-requirement.txt (line 1))
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
