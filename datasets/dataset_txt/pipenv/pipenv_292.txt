tl;dr pipenv emitted a warning but shortened the path to the particular virtual environment it was referring (C:\Users\user1\.\J\S\python.exe). It was difficult to act on the warning because I am not certain which virtual environment (among many I have setup) or which python install (several are installed) this refers (I initially thought pipenv mixed up paths).
Issue description
I have setup five pipenv virtual environments for projects I am hacking at. Also is installed Pythons 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.
When I setup another pipenv virtual environment, pipenv warned me about a possible problem.
Virtualenv location: C:\Users\user1\.virtualenvs\Project1-u18NbQNd
Warning: Your Pipfile requires python_version 3.7, but you are using 3.5.4 (C:\Users\user1\.\J\S\python.exe).
  $ pipenv --rm and rebuilding the virtual environment may resolve the issue.
  $ pipenv check will surely fail.
I cannot determine which project virtual environment the shortened path "C:\Users\user1\.\J\S\python.exe" refers. And I'm not certain if that path is simply the same as the preceding sentence path "C:\Users\user1\.virtualenvs\Project1-u18NbQNd" (I would guess it is, but I'd prefer to be certain). (it turns out the python_version within Pipfile was wrong)
Since I have several Python installs (3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7) and several pipenv virtual environments, I was concerned pipenv was using the wrong pathed Python environment.
Recommended Fix
Print the entire path within the warning message.
