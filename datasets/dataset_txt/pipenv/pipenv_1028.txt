I'm attempting to install the latest version of click from PyPI using pipenv install click. I have activated my virtual environment using pipenv shell before installation. It successfully installs and adds the dependency to my Pipfile, like-so:
[packages]
click = "*"
And, I have navigated to the virtual environment's site-packages directory and confirmed click is there. However, when I run a script which calls import click in my virtual environment, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/index.py", line 3, in <module>
    import click
ImportError: No module named 'click'
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
The package to be imported successfully.
Actual result
I cannot dump the verbose logs, because I'm in a configured corporate environment. However, nothing should be out of the usual.
Steps to replicate
Create a project with the above Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
Create pipenv and install dependencies
Create the following script:
#!/usr/bin/env python

import click

@click.command()
def index():
    """
    Start command
    """
    return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    index()
Run the script.
Things I've tried...
Deleting the virtualenv and recreating it (same issue)
