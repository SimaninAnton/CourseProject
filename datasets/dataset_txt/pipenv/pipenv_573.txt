Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv.
Check the diagnose documentation for common issues before posting! We may close your issue if it is very similar to one of them. Please be considerate, or be on your way.
Make sure to mention your debugging experience if the documented solution failed.
Issue description
Looks like there's a problem with argument quoting, because pipenv somehow ends up with unquoted <=4.5 in a command line to be passed to sh verbatim, and then the shell interprets it as a request to take the file named =4.5 as standard input and naturally fails.
Expected result
I would expect Pipenv to properly select a version that is less or equal to 4.5, because pip has no problems installing a package spec like this:
$ pip install 'zope.interface<=4.5'
Requirement already satisfied: zope.interface<=4.5 in /mnt/extraspace/virtualenvs/pipenv-temp-3yvsdFj0/lib/python3.6/site-packages (4.4.3)
Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /mnt/extraspace/virtualenvs/pipenv-temp-3yvsdFj0/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from zope.interface<=4.5) (40.4.3)
You are using pip version 18.0, however version 18.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Actual result
$ pipenv install --verbose 'zope.interface<=4.5'
Installing zope.interface<=4.5…
⠋Installing 'zope.interface'
$ ['/mnt/extraspace/virtualenvs/pipenv-temp-3yvsdFj0/bin/pip', 'install', '--verbose', '--upgrade', 'zope.interface<=4.5', '-i', 'https://pypi.org/simple']

Error:  An error occurred while installing zope.interface<=4.5!
/bin/sh: 1: cannot open =4.5: No such file
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv install --verbose 'zope.interface<=4.5'
$ pipenv --support
