pip install these days offers an --upgrade-strategy option to let users choose between "only-if-needed" upgrades (which upgrades components only if needed to satisfy new dependencies) and "eager" upgrades, which upgrades everything which has a newer version available that still meets the dependency constraints.
In pip 10, the default strategy is changing from eager to only-if-needed: pypa/pip#4500
pipenv lock currently follows the original pip install --upgrade policy of "upgrade everything".
This is actually fine for my own current use cases - most of my dependencies are stable enough that the combination of loose dependencies in Pipfile and eager upgrades in pipenv lock works well. I also think this remains the right default behaviour for pipenv.
However, I'm wondering if permitting pipenv lock --upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed may make pipenv applicable to more use cases.
