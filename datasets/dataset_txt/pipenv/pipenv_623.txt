I'm interested in determining whether a build required installing any packages with hardware-specific components (extensions, etc.).
Is there a way to get this information from the command line (possibly via pipenv run pip ...), or do I need look in the virtual environment's lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/*.dist-info/ files to determine this?
I'm interested in this because I want to construct a system package from (parts of) the resulting virtual environment.
