For local development with the Heroku CLI, I would like to be able to do something like this:
$ pipenv run heroku local
so that an external program (heroku) can use a program (gunicorn) from within the virtual environment. With pipenv==3.1.9, only commands in the virtual environment are allowed:
The command was not found within the virtualenv!
One possible workaround is:
$ . .venv/bin/activate && heroku local
but I'd like to avoid having to be gnostic of the location of the virtual environment.
