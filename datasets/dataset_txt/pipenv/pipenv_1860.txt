I am using pipenv to create my virtual env within my project repo and then installing the packages I am using. I am having problems importing geopy from within jupyter notebook after installing it using pipenv. Using pipenv graph confirms that geopy is indeed installed, but then after opening a jupyter notebook from within the pipenv shell I get ImportError: No module named geopy when trying to import geopy. I was able to get it working by specifying the version of geopy to install. Now I am having the problem with haversine even though I tried doing what I did for geopy and I added a specific version to install.
