In my opinion this is a minor issue. If I type pipenv --py from within a directory where no Pipfile is present I get an AttributeError complaining that self.pipfile_location is None and so doesn't provide a split() function. See the last lines of the Traceback:
...
File "c:\python36\lib\site-packages\pipenv\project.py", line 99, in virtualenv_name
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[ $`!*@"\\\r\n\t]', '_', self.name)[0:42]
File "c:\python36\lib\site-packages\pipenv\project.py", line 49, in name
    self._name = self.pipfile_location.split(os.sep)[-2]
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
In my opinion it would be better to print a message like used for pipenv --venv which says: "No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!"
