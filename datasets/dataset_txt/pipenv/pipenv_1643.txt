Describe your environment
Ubuntu
python 27, 35, 36
pipenv 9.0.3
Expected result
For some reason, all my tests that check for installation of the entrypoints defined in my setup.py file are failing, because the entrypoints aren't getting isntalled. The package is installed, however. This seems to be a consequence of upgrading from 9.0.1
