I'm wondering there is no documentation on how to use pipenv in production deployment. My current setup for deploying something to production is like the following:
Pushing a new version of my package (as wheel) to my internal PyPi server (running pypiserver)
Setting correct variables like PIP_INDEX_URL to my internal PyPi server on the target server
Running pip install -U my-package on the target server
Restart webserver
Having the list of requirements parsed from a requirements.txt into install_requires in my setup.py. The requirements.txt file is included by MANIFEST.in.
Now I'm courios if it is enough to include Pipfile and Pipfile.lock into my package and run pipenv install on the target production server? Does pipenv automatically use the environment variables like PIP_INDEX_URL? Or is pip install -U my-package still the preferred way? I know that there is pipenv lock -r, but I would like to abandon requirements.txt completely :)
