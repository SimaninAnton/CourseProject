It seems that I am getting hung up on Locking [dev-packages] dependenciesâ€¦.
I was able to get the pipenv to run just two weeks ago in a few minutes, but now it is taking 30+ before I kill it. Not sure if this is a me issue OR if this is a pipenv issue. I don't know how to diagnose. Either.
Can someone help me navigate?
$ pipenv --support
