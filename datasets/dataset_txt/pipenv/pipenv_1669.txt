Describe your environment
macOS 10.13
Python version: 2.7.10 / 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
enum34 should be required
Actual result
enum34 is not required
Steps to replicate
I installed pipenv via homebrew, and that uses python 3. When doing so, the Pipfile.lock does not include enum34. However, if I remove pipenv and install it via pip2 install pipenv, then it does. It appears that pipenv is not generating the requirements properly as flake8 requires enum34 conditionally based on the python version.
