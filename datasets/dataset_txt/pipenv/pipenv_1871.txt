I've recently added a formula for Pipenv to homebrew. So on a Mac with homebrew installed, pipenv can be installed via brew install pipenv
I'm mentioning this in case you want to add homebrew as a possible installation method in the pipenv docs alongside Pipsi and Nix.
If you do want to include homebrew in your docs then I'm happy to write a pull request, but someone else might need to come up with the clever heading.
