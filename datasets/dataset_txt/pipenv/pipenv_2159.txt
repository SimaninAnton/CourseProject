I run these commands and get some unexpected behavior:
pipenv shell
pipenv install leather
(open new tab in iterm outside of virtualenv subshell)
python3
import leather # don't get ModuleNotFoundError
pipenv uninstall from inside the subshell wipes it from the global packages.
Since pipenv --venv inside the subshell (in the project directory) works, I'd expect pipenv install/uninstall to work or give some sort of error.
Also, running pipenv uninstall in a directory where there isn't a python project will install pipenv and then attempt to wipe the package (unsuccessfully, because it's not there).
