Hello,
We're using pipenv to install packages from a private pypi server and it seems to have issues installing/uninstalling/updating packages with names that include periods and underscores. Here are some examples:
# 1
pipenv install company.application.my_tool # Entry in Pipfile is written as company-application-my-tool
pipenv uninstall company.application.my_tool # Properly uninstalls package, but incorrect entry is left in the Pipfile

# 2
pipenv install company.application.my_tool # This package has a single dependency (dep_package = "*")
pipenv update # Even if a new version of dep_package is available, it does not get updated

VS

pipenv install simple-my-tool # This package has a single dependency (simple-dep-package = "*")
pipenv update # simple-dep-package is updated if a new version is available
pip handles installation/installation/updating of these packages without issue (although, it also does convert the underscore to a hyphen when using pip list.
