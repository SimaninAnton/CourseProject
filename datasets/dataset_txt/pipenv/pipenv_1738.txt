If you move the project home it leaves the virtualenv folder. This is a problem if you create a new project home with the same name/path because it will use the virtualenv folder with the packages of the other project.
Describe your environment
Ubuntu
Python version: Python 2.7.6
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.0
Expected result
Keep the virtualenv when you move/rename the project home. A new virtualenv when you create a new project in the same path as an older project.
That is, move virtualenv folder when you move/rename the project home.
Actual result
After moving/renaming the project home pipenv creates a new virtualenv and it has to reinstall all packages again. The old virtualenv remains there wasting space.
Creating a new project in the same path keeps the older project packages.
