I'm starting a wxPython project which requires a framework build of Python. I installed 3.6.4 from Python.org including all the options, and have pipenv use it with the pipenv --python 3.6.4 arguments (followed by a pipenv install wxpython).
Pipenv tells us it's using a framework build of python (path contains Python.framework):
Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3.6m to create virtualenv…
However the program won't run, it says it's not using a framework build of python.
Describe your environment
macOs High Sierra 10.13.3
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
Expect the virtual environment to use the installed framework version of python.
Actual result
This program needs access to the screen. Please run with a
Framework build of python, and only when you are logged in
on the main display of your Mac.
Steps to replicate
install python.org 3.6.4 with the default installation options, reinstall pip3; and pipenv, pew and virtualenv with --user.
mkdir wxpythontest && cd wxpythontest
pipenv --python 3.6.4
pipenv install wxpython
