I'm trying out the feature with installing python versions with pyenv (awesome work!) and I stumbled accross this one:
➜  pipenv --python 3.4
➜  Warning: Python 3.4 was not found on your system…
➜  Would you like us to install latest CPython 3.4 with pyenv? [Y/n]:
Which is expected behavior, however if I want to specify micro version e.g. 1, it doesn't offer option to install with pyenv witch results in:
➜  pipenv --python 3.4.1
➜  Warning: Python 3.4.1 was not found on your system…
➜  You can specify specific versions of Python with:
  $ pipenv --python path/to/python
Is that the correct behavior ?
