@kennethreitz I'm having trouble installing local packages in relative directories via -e.
This is the initial requirements.txt file:
-e ../../lib/python
arrow==0.10.0
blessings==1.6
boto3==1.4.7
This is what the converted Pipfile looks like:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[packages]
"-e file:///users/johria/development/heliograf/lib/python" = "*"
arrow = "==0.10.0"
blessings = "==1.6"
heliograf in this case is the name in setup.py of the relative package.
I believe the issue may be that the Pipfile.lock doesn't have the directory?
        "heliograf": {
            "hashes": [],
            "version": "==0.1.0"
        },
While the above is starting from the requirements.txt, this kind of works: pipenv install -e ../../lib/python
It adds another entry into the Pipefile like this:
"-e ../../lib/python" = "*"
I can see that the package is installed properly by running pipenv run python and importing the package. In addition, doing a pipenv shell followed by a pip freeze shows:
-e git+git@github.com:WPMedia/heliograf.git@4dbd528e2f2daeb4b4462b29d2dc8c54341428b5#egg=heliograf&subdirectory=lib/python

versions:
python version: 3.6.2
pipenv version: 7.0.1
python installed via: pyenv
