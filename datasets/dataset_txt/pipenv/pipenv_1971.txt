I installed some packages to dev-packages then wanted to uninstall one of them. The result was that all packages in dev-packages were uninstalled.
Steps to Reproduce
$ pipenv install --dev pytest pytest-flask
$ pipenv uninstall --dev pytest-flask
Expected Pipfile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[dev-packages]
pytest = "*"
Actual Pipfile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
Pipenv Version
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.2.6
