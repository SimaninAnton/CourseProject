Would it be possible to add an --output flag to pipenv graph?
Having a file to search through makes it much easier to find dependancy problems than in the terminal.
I currently bodge this by running pipenv.core.do_graph() and capturing the sdtout (and handling the sys.exit() exception), but a flag would make this a useful feature.
