To Reproduce:
Activate a virtual env using virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper
Go to a folder with no Pipenv/pipfile
$ pipenv shell
Result:
Raises
ERROR: Environment 'folder-1AY1GkYk' does not exist. Create it with 'pew new folder-1AY1GkYk'.
Expected
An error about a virtualenv already being active. Perhaps similar to the error shown when using
$ pipenv --three, which issues a courtesy warning:
'Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment ... '
Note
While I understand pipenv can't always play nice with every possible virtual env configurations it might find itself one, standard virtualenv is still widely used and until I can migrate all projects I still find myself jumping between the two and making these types of mistakes often. Hopefuly I am not the only one : )
These courtesy messages are incredibly helpful and can save users and maintainers troubleshooting time
