Loving pipenv so far!
Pipenv has a number of helpful commands like graph, install, and run. I'm not sure what the right command name would be, but I wish I could run pipenv python script.py instead of pipenv run python script.py.
I realize I could alias it, but it would be quite nice to have it come standard.
