Hi,
pip==19 current contains a bug that is preventing a majority of my Python projects from building (those with a pandas dependency - it appears.
It is currently recommended to build virtual environments with pip<19. However, pipenv doesn't appear to allow you to easily specify the version of pip to use, honour the pip version installed by the base interpreter (provided by --python) or a pip requirement set in the Pipfile.
I understand that this is because pipenv wants to know the environment tools it's using to it can consistently build environments without the user being able to mess it up. However, would it be reasonable for pipenv to support a minimum version to allow the user to at least jump back a major version when issues like this come up. i.e. pipenv install --python 3.7.2 --pip 18.1.
Unless there is actually a way of currently handling this situation I was unable to find. I've tried changing the pip in the pipenv environment, the base interpreter's environment, the global system pip, and the Pipfile.
However, I did find that doing pipenv install pip==18.1 --dev --python 3.7.2 appeared to work. I think that would actually be considered a bug as following that with pipenv install --dev does not then use that 18.1 for subsequent installs - unless explicitly handed to pipenv install again.
Thanks
