In attempting to help with a ticket, support personnel went into my work area and, presumably trying to set up a virtualenv of their own to test in, created one directly with virtualenv in the same folder I've been using pipenv in.
After that it would seem that pipenv shell would activate their virtual environment rather than mine, evidenced by the path changing to (working path)/.venv/etc and pipenv graph only showing the components being tested rather than my entire set of dependencies.
Moving the ./.venv elsewhere seemed to restore my environment, but I'm honestly not familiar enough with pipenv or virtualenv to understand if this behavior makes sense or not.
$ pipenv --support
