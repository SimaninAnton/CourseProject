Pipenv 11.0.2, pip 9.0.1
Running pipenv update <pkg> results in Requirement not upgraded as not directly required: <pkg> in ./.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages (i.e. not a dependency, the main package).
This seems to be because a -U would have been needed in the pip command string, when updating (since the requested package is already installed).
