I don't see how to setup the current project directly with pipenv install, without doing the old-school python setup.py develop, ie, the equivalent of pip install -e .. It looks like pip does some extra work more, isn't it needed for pipenv as well?
Also, I don't know if I should do pip install -e . or python setup.py develop like it is in your .travis.yml ?
