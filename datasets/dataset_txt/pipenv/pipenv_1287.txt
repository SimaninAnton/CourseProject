Hi Kenneth! Check this tool I built: https://github.com/peterdemin/pip-compile-multi
Do you think PipEnv can/should have it's functionality?
I know PipEnv supports separation of dev and prod requirements, but in my projects I have more, like docs, linters, tests and so on.
I also need compatibility with Python 2.7 and 3.4 and can't use 3.6+.
Here are good examples of such projects:
