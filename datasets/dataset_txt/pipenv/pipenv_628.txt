Issue description
pip fails to install pipenv on OSX
Expected result
Expected to have pipenv successfully installed after running pip3 install pipenv
Actual result
pip hangs when making a request to PyPI:
Collecting pipenv
  1 location(s) to search for versions of pipenv:
  * https://pypi.org/simple/pipenv/
  Getting page https://pypi.org/simple/pipenv/

Steps to replicate
Using pip3 (18.0) on OSX 10.14 (Mojave), run the following:
pip3 install pipenv
Let me know if this might be an issue with PyPI and pip, and not pipenv. Thanks!
