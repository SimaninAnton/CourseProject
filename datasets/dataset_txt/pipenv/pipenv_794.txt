Note: https://kenneth-reitz.uservoice.com/forums/913660-general says "This site is not currently active" and I think this query is too speculative for StackOverflow, so I've posted the query here. (If there's an official answer, then it stops being speculative ;D )
From the (excellent) documentation, the semantics of a pipenv's pipfile is a loosely-versioned list of the dependencies for the package. The pipfile.lock is an environment-specific list of the exact dependencies installed.
So, my hunch is that I must commit my pipfile to my package repo (otherwise how will you know what the dependencies are?) but I must not commit my pipfile.lock (what if I use GNU/Linux and you use Windows). Is this correct?
