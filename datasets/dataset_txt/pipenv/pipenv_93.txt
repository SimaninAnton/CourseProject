Issue description
Using the latest Pipenv and the supplied Pipfile, I'm attempting to add the binary package psycopg2-binary (our environment cannot build the non binary option) but Pipenv will install both psycopg2-binary and psycopg2, which leads to the install failing (due to not being able to build psycopg2 from source)
I've deleted Pipfile.lock and the same issue still occurs.
Expected result
running 'pipenv install psycopg2-binary' should install only psycopg2-binary and not psycopg2
Actual result
Pipenv installs the source package psycopg2
Steps to replicate
Open a new environment
Copy the given pipfile
Run 'pipenv install'
Watch as Pipfile.lock now contains psycopg2 as well as psycopg2-binary
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
$ pipenv --support
