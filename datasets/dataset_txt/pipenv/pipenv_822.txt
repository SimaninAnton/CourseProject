I am having a special setup. I have a docker in which I create an emulated ARM rootfs using QEMU. Inside the emulated rootfs , I am going to create a virtual environment using pipenv which I can use later on my ARM target.
What is happening now is that I am always receiving the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    crayons.green(shorten_path(path_to_python)),
TypeError: __str__ returned non-string (type NoneType)
As I traced the exception, I found out that problem here is that the python_version() method returns None in my case. Then as I use docker exec to run pipenv install, I think I am mixing different shell environment, therefore crayons.green cannot convert None type to string. My proposal would be simply just use str in all crayons e.g. crayons.green(str(python_version(path_to_python)))
