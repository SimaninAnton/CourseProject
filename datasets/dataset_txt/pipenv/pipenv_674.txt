Issue description
When on a bash shell, tab completion does not complete executables. As an example if you have ansible installed pipenv run a and pressing tab will not complete on the executables.
Note this issue occurs with all files in the bin path for the environment and not just ansible.
Expected result
pipenv run a would complete to pipenv run ansible- and suggest the executables it could be such as ansible-playbook or ansible-vault.
Actual result
pipenv run a pressing tab just errors
Steps to replicate
MacOS 10.13
brew install pipenv
mkdir test
cd test
pipenv install ansible
pipenv run a press tab
$ pipenv --support
