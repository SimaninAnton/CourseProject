This is a cross post from stack overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48805350/how-to-build-falcon-with-cython-using-pipenv
In the falcon docs it is mentioned that in order to build falcon with cython the following commands need to be issued:
$ pip install cython
$ pip install --no-binary :all: falcon
The question is how to do this with pipenv.
First of all i want to say Pipfile that i have build dependency cython.
I want also to pass the parameters --no-binary :all: falcon to pip.
How can i accomplish this with pipenv?
