$ pipenv install
-- creates a virtualenv and created Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
$ pipenv install django
Q: It places the django in the Pipfile and also regenerated the Pipfile.lock with all the dependecies.
So whenever i install any package using pipenv, Pipfile.lock is also updated.
HOw does the hash comparision works so that form the hash of Pipfile it comes to know whether Pipfile.lock is outdated or not.
