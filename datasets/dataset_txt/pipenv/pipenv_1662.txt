problem
pipenv's opening documentation here is worded such that I expected that I could actually package and ship my project with pipenv.
can i package/publish my project with pipenv?
if so, how? the docs and issues from what I've searched omit mention of this
anyway, thanks! so far feels like a much better UX that past tooling
