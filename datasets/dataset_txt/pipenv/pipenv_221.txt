$ pipenv --support
This is in direct reference to the issues raised in #924.
Is there currently a way to explicity forbid installation of a package via the Pipfile?
I am currently have trouble installing the package argon2-cffi via pipenv because the lockfile is being generated with all subpackages, despite them being expressly forbid by the setup.py (https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi/blob/master/setup.py#L98). I realize via discussion on issue #924 that supporting version_info "hacks" are a quagmire, but I was wondering if there was a way to forbid the package in the Pipfile instead? Alternatively, would this be a good extension request?
I have a minimum reproducible Travis CI job that shows where the issue comes in for this: https://travis-ci.org/murrple-1/pipenv-issue-3 - you'll notice that enum34 is being installed, and is overriding the API of the standard-library enum.py
