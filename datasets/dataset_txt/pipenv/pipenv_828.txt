Issue description
When I send the output of pipenv graph to some other command via a pipe, it will write some exception to stderr.
Expected result
{~}pipenv graph | head -n 1
somepackage==1.0.248
Actual result
{~}pipenv graph | head -n 1
somepackage==1.0.248
Exception ignored in: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
I don't believe this is related to my local setup, so I added only the more relevant output of pipenv --support:
$ pipenv --support
