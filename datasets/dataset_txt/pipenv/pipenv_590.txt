when building my dockerfile it keeps telling me there is no directory, I have even tried pointing it directly to path but to no prevail. basically trying to learn my way around docker for my boss but can't even get it to initiate installing the specified apps in my requirements.txt.
Step 6/9 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
---> Running in 34df017c7b91
Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
ERROR: Service 'web' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c pip install -r requirements.txt' returned a non-zero code: 1
