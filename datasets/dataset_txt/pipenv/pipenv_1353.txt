You can upload packages to PyPI and sign the distributions using GnuPG with twine (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#upload-your-distributions).
My recommendation for pipenv is that you can (optionally) add a GnuPG key to the pip/piplock file for packages. The update or installation process will then only work if the packages has been signed with the correct GnuPG key.
While I agree that pipenv should not add too many features and focus on being relatively lighweight and functional, I think this is an important issue because of security. Manually veryfing signatures is not the way to go.
