As an mkvirtualenv user, there's one must-have feature that's become really important to me, and that's having a configurable (env variable?) default location for virtualenvs. Personally, I used .local/share/virtualenvs, but that's just a matter of preference.
Having them inside projects (repositories) is a bit annoying since lots of tools won't ignore them, disk-usage is harder to track, and a few other nitpicks.
Note: I'm aware that it may not be the most popular option. I don't mind keeping the current default, but just think that configurability would be nice.
