Having used virtualenvwrapper for eternity, I find it really hard to wrap my head around the fact that I can't just activate a pipenv from any folder in my filesystem. I have to be in the folder where the Pipenv file is, then I can use pipenv shell.
You could say that I can simply source the activate script in the .virtualenvs folder, but for example in Ansible scripts where I do the initial server provisioning, it is really inconventient that I don't know the name of the virtualenv because it has that hash value in the name. I will always know the path to my Pipenv file, though, so if I could do something like pipenv shell|run --path=/path/to/Pipenv then I would not need to know the name of the virtualenv any more.
Am I overthinking this? Is something similar already in place?
