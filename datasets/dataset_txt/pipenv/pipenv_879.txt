The automatic pipenv shell script for Bash on the wiki will not work properly if the path to a virtualenv contains a space, or if a project name contains a space.
The workon function should have quotes around the paths, like so:
workon() {
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]
    then
        source "$(pipenv --venv)/bin/activate"
    else
        source "~/.virtualenvs/$1/bin/activate"
    fi
}
Arguably, all the uses of cd ... should also be cd ... || return 1, so that the functions stop if they can't access a directory.
I would fix this myself, but it looks like only people marked as collaborators on GitHub can edit the wiki.
