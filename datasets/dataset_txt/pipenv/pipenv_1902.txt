Describe you environment
OS Type
Ubuntu
Python version: $ python -V
2.7
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version
8.2
Expected result
When using pipenv -r requirements.txt, if one mistype the path to therequirements file, pipenv print a message stating it's unable to fine the file, print the absolute file path of the requirements file, and exit cleanly.
Actual result
Pipenv crashes with a cryptic message.
  File "/home/user/.local/venvs/pipenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pipenv/cli.py", line 234, in import_requirements
    assert os.path.isfile(r)
AssertionError
Steps to replicate
Run:
pipenv install  -r requirements.txt 
But in the wrong directory.
Because pipenv can autodetect a pipfile somewhere in the file tree, it may not seem like you are making a mistake and that you are at the wrong place.
