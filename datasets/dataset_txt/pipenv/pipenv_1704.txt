pipenv update --dry-run is not working.
Describe your environment
OS Type
macOS 10.13
Python version: $ python -V
Python 3.6.3
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 9.0.1
Expected result
Report which packages to be updated.
Actual result
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project.
Checking dependenciesâ€¦
Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
Could not find a version that matches entrypoints>=0.2.2
Tried: (no version found at all)

All good!
