Having a Pipfile as:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}

[dev-packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true, extras=["dev"]}
After the Pipfile.lock file is generated, if we modify dependencies in setup.py and do a pipenv install --deploy it happily installs the dependencies without noticing the dependencies in the source have changed.
The reason is because the pipfile.hash property checks only for Pipfile contents but, in our case our dependencies are defined in setup.py.
For us, expected result would be the command failing because dependencies in setup.py and Pipfile.lock don't match.
For reference, part of the code where --deploy option is implemented:
pipenv/pipenv/cli.py
Line 1270 in f5b4824
 if (project.lockfile_exists and not ignore_pipfile) and not skip_lock: 
Haven't found any issue related so sorry in advance if this is already documented/discussed somewhere
