Issue description
I am a first time user of pip and pipenv. pipenv is failing to launch when trying to install a library. I have fully installed and updated pip, and python 3.
Expected result
Expected to have pipenv install the "requests" library. When using the pipenv install requests command. Note: I am able to get it to run when using the following command: python -m pipenv install requests
Actual result
The following is returned when attempting to run pipenv:
Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"c:\python37\python.exe" "C:\Users\drtri\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\pipenv.exe" install requests --verbose
Steps to replicate
Run the following within cmd on windows: pipenv install requests --verbose
Support request:
Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"c:\python37\python.exe" "C:\Users\drtri\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\pipenv.exe" --support'
Additional notes
I noticed that using python -m pipenv install requests seems to work. However, once I try and use import requests within a python script, I get a "No module names 'requests' found" error.
