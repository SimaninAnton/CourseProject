Is there a way to move certain packages into the project's directory? Because packages that use the CLI require different path structures than the one initialized in the code. Here is an example of when I was trying to use Flask-Migrate.
For example:
from myapp import app
Works fine when I'm running the app.
But when I run a flask-migrate command I get:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'myapp'
Then I have to change it to a relative path for it to work:
from .myapp import app
Is there a workaround for this?
