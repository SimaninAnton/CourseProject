If the terminal background is dark, then the estimated time is difficult to see. See the attached screenshot.
Versions
OS Type: Linux, Debian, BunsenLabs
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.0.3
Expected result
Leave the color as default? Or also set the color background to make sure the text is visible. Terminal emulators usually support the reverse sequence: \033[;7m.
Actual result
Estimated time text might not be visible.
Steps to replicate
pipenv install
