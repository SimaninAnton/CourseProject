I have the following error on pipenv (latest version) now pip has updated to pip10:
Installing -e ./deps/mysubmod…

Error:  An error occurred while installing -e ./deps/mysubmod!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/pip", line 7, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main'
I have this same issue when I try to use pip or pip3 directly on my system.
Using python3 -m pip instead of pip solve this issue, but this needs to be fixed inside the pipenv code.
System Ubuntu 16.04
pip: 10
pipenv 11.10
inside a docker image (so env is clean)
