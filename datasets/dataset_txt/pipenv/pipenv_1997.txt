I have a project with a simple Pipfile:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]

bouncer = "*"
flask = "*"
"flask-bouncer" = "*"
"flask-marshmallow" = "*"
"flask-sqlalchemy" = "*"
marshmallow = "*"
"marshmallow-sqlalchemy" = "*"
"psycopg2" = "*"
pyjwt = "*"
sqlalchemy = "*"
webargs = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
pipenv install is working as expected. Creates a new virtual environment and stuff. Now if I want to launch the environment using pipenv shell
C:\Users\fkraus\Projects\test-project>pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' to return.

Der Befehl "C:\Program" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder
konnte nicht gefunden werden.
The error translates to something like The command "C:\Program" is mistyped or can not be found.
My Python installation is globally available at C:\Python36. Looks like it is searching the Python installation at C:\Program. Is this intentionally or do I have a configuration error?
Edit: My virtual environment is properly created at C:\Users\fkraus\Envs\test-project-_LTCrZAU.
