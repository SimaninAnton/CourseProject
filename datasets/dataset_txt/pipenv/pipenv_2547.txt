Many prefer to keep their OS Python install clean of any 3rd party packages.
For others it's not even a choice as they don't have sudo access.
It would be nice to have instructions for an unprivileged user to get pipenv on their PATH in some way.
This seems hacky but it seems to work...
System with Python 3
python3 -m venv ~/bin/_pipenv
source ~/bin/_pipenv/bin/activate
pip install pipenv
ln -s ~/bin/_pipenv/bin/pipenv ~/bin
System with Python2 and virtualenv
virtualenv ~/bin/_pipenv2
source ~/bin/_pipenv2/bin/activate
pip install pipenv
ln -s ~/bin/_pipenv2/bin/pipenv ~/bin/pipenv2
