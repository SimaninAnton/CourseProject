The order of hashes in both Pipfile.lock and --requirements output is not deterministic: every pipenv update shuffles them around which makes running an update and checking for changes pointless.
Describe your environment
OS Type macOS High Sierra
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 10.1.2
NB Iâ€™m using devpi as a PyPI mirror.
Expected result
The hashes should be in a stable order. Easiest would be to just sort them alphabetically.
Actual result
The order changes with every run.
Steps to replicate
Install a bunch of packages, run update. Watch hashes permutate.
