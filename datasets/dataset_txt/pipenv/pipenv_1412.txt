I am installing a package with a dependency that have a python versiÃ³n condition. It depends on a django version for python2 and another for python3 (the version I am using) but pipenv are choosing the py2 version of the package. I tried to force the new one installation but it fail.
pipenv install drf-yasg 'django>2'
If I install drf-yasg with pip in a fresh virtualenv it install django>=2.0.0 so it's not a pip problem, is a problem of pipenv when locking.
