As far as I can tell, the pipenv command line tool always derives the project directory (Pipfile location) from the current working directory. Is there a way to tell pipenv which project directory to use as a command-line option? If not, is this a compelling feature request?
In my use case, I want to determine the venv path for a project from a script. I'd prefer not to change the current working directory just to invoke pipenv --venv in a shell process. Is there a stable API for doing this directly from Python? (Whereas the feature request to accept a project dir on the command line would be a similar API for shell scripting.)
