Issue description
When creating a new project with pipenv on my laptop using PyCharm it generates 2 files in the project diectory. Pipfile and Pipfile.lock - When I create a project using my desktop PC it stores the versions etc in a piplock file but there isn't one that is generated in the project folder. I think that all the different projects requirements might be in the same file or in pipfiles are being created else where. I want to learn how to fix this. This happens when making the project manually or with PyCharm
Expected result
Pipfile and pipfile.lock in the project directory on my desktop. Works for others and my laptop but not on PC.
Steps to replicate
Just create a new project using PyCharm or Pipenv command line.
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
C:\Users\rohan\Desktop\Testtttt>pipenv --support
$ pipenv --support
==========================================
The above is run in a new project I created 30 seconds before running the command. I am confused as to why all my dependencies from other projects are in there. Anyway, thanks in advance for the help.
