I tried using pipenv with flask yesterday, and ran into an issue when running it in debug mode (which enables auto-reloading of the application when a module's code changes).
% pipenv run python -m myapp
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/andreas/dev/myapp/myapp/__main__.py", line 1, in <module>
    from myapp import app
ImportError: No module named 'myapp'
It looks like the subprocess doesn't start inside the virtualenv. It doesn't seem to make a difference if I run this with pipenv run or inside a pipenv shell. Running it inside a manually activated virtualenv works fine.
