I cloned a new project with structure like this:
$ tree -L 1
.
├── baidu_buzz
├── Pipfile
└── README.md

1 directory, 2 files
My environment
OS: Arch Linux x86_64
Python 3.6.3
pipenv, version 8.2.7
Expected result
$ pipenv install will install packages described in Pipfile.
Actual result
$ pipenv install --verbose
Pipfile.lock not found, creating…

Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.                                                      
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.                                      
Could not find a version that matches pymongo

[dev-packages]
$ pipenv install will produce the error.
I follow the advise #993 (comment) to create this issue. Although $ pipenv install --skip-lock will bypass the issue, I want to figure out what's wrong with my project.
