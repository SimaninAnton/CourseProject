Describe your environment
OS Type: macOS 10.13.3 (17D102)
Python version: Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.1.0
Expected result
I expected that running pipenv install . would give:
[packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = "."}

(or "e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = false}, not sure which is correct)
In addition, I would expect that:
pipenv install . --dev would give:
[dev-packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = "."}

(or "e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = false}, not sure which is correct)
Actual result
pipenv does not install the local package at all.
However, trying to do the same thing with pip works:
$ pipenv shell
$ pip install .
Processing /path/myproject
Installing collected packages: myproject
  Running setup.py install for myproject ... done
Successfully installed myproject-0.1.2
Editable installs work as expected:
pipenv install -e . gives:
[packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
pipenv install -e . --dev gives:
[dev-packages]

"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
Steps to replicate
cd /python/app/source
pipenv install . or pipenv install . --dev
