Hello,
I hope this is not a duplicate.
I'm trying to install clay which works only with Python 2.7.
However I'm unable to lock dependenciesâ€¦
`$ python -m pipenv.help output`
Pipenv version: `'11.7.2'`
Expected result
Lock the dependencies.
Actual result
Could not find a version that matches Cheroot==5.1.0,>=5.9.1
