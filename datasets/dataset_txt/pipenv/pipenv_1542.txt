I've recently started using pipenv. I like it, but I miss having pip show around. Doing pip shell ; pip show PKG_NAME makes me unhappy.
I've started a branch to add this command, although it occurs to me to ask whether this is considered a bad feature to add for some reason, such as because there's another canonical way to get this info that I didn't know about or something.
My WIP PR is #1461. I do plan to make it less crappy, although not before hearing that the basic idea is welcome.
