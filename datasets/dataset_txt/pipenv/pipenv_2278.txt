Pip has a cli setting --trusted-host that allows you to use a private package index over http (as opposed to https).
Pipenv does not allow setting of this field and so it is not possible to use the custom package index.
I imagine this could be fixed by adding the setting to pipfile under the [[source]] section, or by automatically extracting the host from the source url.
The repository located at <private_url> is not a trusted or secure host and is being ignored. If this repository is available via HTTPS it is recommended to use HTTPS instead, otherwise you may silence this warning and allow it anyways with '--trusted-host <private_host>'.
