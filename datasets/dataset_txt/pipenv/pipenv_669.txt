Issue description
I have a very simple Pipfile for a new project, it includes nothing except moto as a dev dependency, but pipenv lock fails to resolve dependencies. The moto library installs fine with vanilla pip.
I deleted ~/.cache/pipenv and tried with pipenv lock --clear as suggested in the FAQ, but it didn't make any difference.
Expected result
I expected dependencies to be resolved and a Pipfile.lock to be generated.
Actual result
$ pipenv lock --verbose
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
