$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 2018.05.18

$ pipenv check --help
Usage: pipenv check [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...

Options:
  --three / --two  Use Python 3/2 when creating virtualenv.
  --python TEXT    Specify which version of Python virtualenv should use.
  --system         Use system Python.
  --unused TEXT    Given a code path, show potentially unused dependencies.
  -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
There's a field called short_help ("Checks for security vulnerabilities and against PEP 508 markers provided in Pipfile.") which appears when running pipenv alone, but it doesn't appear when running pipenv check --help. It probably should appear there, because that's what people run when they want to know what pipenv check does.
