As a Fedora packager, I take the tagged tarball from GitHub and want to package it, however the tagged version 2018.11.26 still has 2018.11.15.dev0 at https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/742ae1b99b335ffb6d83a2240035af739cacafff/pipenv/__version__.py
Not sure if you are aware, probably not worth rereleasing.
