I´m intrigued that when printing to terminal print() behaves differently when I use a standard python shell and the pipenv virtual environment, as below:
Expected result
On normal python shell (non-virtualenv) print() shows the entire expected html output:
>>> from urllib.request import urlopen

>>> r = urlopen('http://www.example.com/index.html')
>>> print(r.read())
Actual result
However doing the same in my project's virtual environment (pipenv run python) just shows only part of the output. When I specify the argument in print(r.read(10000)) the output varies.
Already tried using requests library and open a local html file. Same behavior.
Any clues to explain this behavior?
