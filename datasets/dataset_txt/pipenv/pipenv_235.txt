I am trying to update package which is already in Pipfile, but pipenv update won't do anything.
Pipfile
[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
tabulate = "*"
pandas = "*"
scikit-learn = "*"
pipeworker = "==0.1.3"

[requires]
python_version = "3.7"
Pipfile.lock
....
 "pipeworker": {
            "hashes": [
                "sha256:a26ce72074f52a36cb59d83b4326467993d19a1a3d083d34cfe74bdc998e9d5a",
                "sha256:d9cf6509301479fe5b3e66578b90438bb12f3dff676e8a32b19e98f944b1b12e"
            ],
            "index": "pypi",
            "version": "==0.1.3"
        },
....
Trying to update:
(tube-example) bash-3.2$ pipenv update pipeworker
