Hi guys. I believe there is a bug somewhere in pipenv which is causing the behaviour highlighted here: fabric/fabric#1675.
In short, I had to manually specify a dependency of another dependency in my Pipenv file because someone (pipenv? virtualenv? something else?) wasn't able to see it and therefore import it while issuing CLI commands within the scope of a pipenv shell session.
Anything you need me to do to help troubleshoot this please let me know. Thank you in advance.
