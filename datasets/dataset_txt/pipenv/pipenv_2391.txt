I'm on OS X Sierra running pipenv 3.5.2. Everything seems to work correctly. But when dropping into shell:pipenv shell I get Launching subshell in virtual environment... However the terminal prompt doesn't change to show I'm in the virtual environment - looks like my normal terminal prompt. Examples I see in the doc, look like the prompt should change as it does in virtualenvironment. Is there a configuration setting I'm missing? Thanks
