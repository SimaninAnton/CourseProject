Describe the solution you'd like
Would it be possible to get some extra reporting on decisions that are likely to impact people like this? I'm really not bothered by the versionning system change but it was a bit disappointing neither /releases or HISTORY.txt have anything notable about the change. HISTORY just had a single line of - Switch to calver for versioning. and I had to search the issue tracker to find the perfectly valid reasoning.
pipenv is becoming increasingly important to my projects so a bit more overt transparency would be appreciated even if my projects aren't part of pipenv
Describe alternatives you've considered
Slap a bit more information in HISTORY.txt when there is something worth talking about. Sure, "worth" is a very subjective concept but there is no reason why HISTORY.txt can't be rewritten updated if people later notice that there was something important to talk about.
Actually, /releases and HISTORY.txt are just the first places I would check. Even slapping in a link to a blog post somewhere is fine.
