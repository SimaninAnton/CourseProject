It is a common knowledge that pipenv lock takes FOREVER to complete on large projects with hundreds of dependancies. I am not sure which step is the bottleneck, but if it is hash calculation of thousands of files, maybe it would be a good idea to utilise the gpu for that? It would be amazing if it was possible to reuse some bitcoin miners for pipfile locking.
