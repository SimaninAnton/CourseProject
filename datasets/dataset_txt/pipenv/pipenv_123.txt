Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The readme says Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world., but its installation section does not even contain an installation command for Windows. Instead, one is referred to documentation for instructions.
Describe the solution you'd like
List install instruction for Windows in readme, e.g. pip install pipenv. Alternatively, create a Chocolatey package (a Windows package manager) and then write choco install pipenv.
Edit: Corrected pyenv to pipenv.
