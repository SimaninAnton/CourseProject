Issue description
When installing a package with extras (eg: gunicorn[eventlet]), the extras dependency is installed, but the marker "markers": "extra == 'eventlet'", results it in not being installed when re-creating the environment (eg: pipenv install when the virtualenv does not exist.
Expected result
The extras dependency (in this case, eventlet) should be installed both when initially installing gunicorn[eventlet], and when re creating the environment. The resulting environment should always be consistent.
Actual result
The extra-dependency is only installed when initially installing the depending package, but not when recreating the environment.
Steps to replicate
pipenv install "gunicorn[eventlet]"
pip freeze | grep eventlet  # eventlet is installed
# delete the virtualenv
pipenv install
pip freeze | grep eventlet  # eventlet is NOT installed
$ pipenv --support
