When installing dev packages via pipenv install <dev-package> they are added to the Pipfiles [packages] section if not present already. My current workaround is to manualy copy & paste added dev paclages from the [packages] into the [dev-packages] section. It would be great if one could specify the package type via a command line option to pipe new dev package dependencies into the Pipfiles dev-package section.
