Issue description
When installing a new package using pipenv install <package>, it outputs something like this:
1 Installing <package-name>.
2 Adding to Pipfile's [packages].
3 Installation Succeeded
4 Pipfile.lock (1d27c4) out of date, updating to (444a6d).
5 Locking [dev-packages] dependencies.
6 Locking [packages] dependencies.
7 Success!
8 Updated Pipfile.lock (1d27c4)!
9 Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock (1d27c4).
Note that: in line 4 of the output above, the hash value Pipfile.lock (1d27c4) out of date is actually the hash value of the new Pipfile as shown in both line 8, and 9 of the output.
Expected result
Expecting to see this output in line 4 of the above output instead:
Pipfile.lock (CURRENT_HASH) out of date, updating to (NEW_HASH)
That is:
Pipfile.lock (444a6d) out of date, updating to (1d27c4).
Actual result
Pipfile.lock (1d27c4) out of date, updating to (444a6d).
