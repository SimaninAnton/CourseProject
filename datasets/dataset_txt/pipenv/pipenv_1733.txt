I opened a PR #1193 because I tried to update a project's dependencies using the --clear flag, but that flag isn't currently passed to the subsequent do_lock function, and is only used on dry-run calls. While digging, I noticed that the verbose flag isn't passed as well.
So this issue's purpose is to ask, what flags should be "passed around" and when?
