Hi, I ' ve noticed that shutilwhich is for importing which function. At description at pypi is said that it is not needed in pythons 3.3 and above. From setup.py I asume you don't support versions below 3.3.
pipenv/setup.py
Line 130 in d5e446e
 python_requires=">=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*", 

And it seems you dont import this vendor in your project.

Hope that the issue is meaningful
