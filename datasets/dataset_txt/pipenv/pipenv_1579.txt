Do not re-lock dependencies that are already locked when doing a pipenv install <package>. If I have a lockfile and want to add a new package, there does not seem to be a sane way to add that package without triggering pipenv to upgrade the locked versions of all installed packages.
Describe your environment
OS Type: macos 10.13.3
Python version: Python 3.6.0
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
Run pipenv install pkgA and then later pipenv install pkgB and see that pkgA was untouched, still pinned where it was before.
Actual result
Run pipenv install pkgA and then later pipenv install pkgB and see that pkgA was upgraded to a newer version just because I installed unrelated pkgB.
In yarn this is very clearly separated by yarn install versus yarn upgrade where it will only re-lock the dependency if you change its pin range and run yarn install or if you run yarn upgrade. If you run yarn install without changing the pin on the dependency then it is never upgraded.
