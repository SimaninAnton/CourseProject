After updating to the latest version of pipenv, 8.1.4, normal commands stopped working.
(sorry, I no longer have the full stacktrace)
I found out it was because the console script didn't get updated:
#!/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.6
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'pipenv==7.9.2','console_scripts','pipenv'
__requires__ = 'pipenv==7.9.2'
import re
import sys
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(
        load_entry_point('pipenv==7.9.2', 'console_scripts', 'pipenv')()
    )
Replacing 7.9.2 with 8.1.4 worked, but the better solutions seemed to be pip3 install -U --force-reinstall pipenv, which solved the problem by replacing the console script with the new one altogether. Everything is working swimmingly again!
Thanks for all you do, @kennethreitz
