This might be a windows only issue - Pipenv version 11.10.1
I am using cmder console
Steps to replicate
`set PIPENV_SHELL="c:\path_with space\enclosed\inquotes\shell"
pipenv shell
Expected result
Pipenv Shell is activated with the desired shell
Actual result
Pipenv Shell is activated with the default shell (cmd.exe)
'c:\path_with' is not regognized as an internal or external command
I use a portable cmder that is in a folder location that has spaces in its path.
To use Pipenv with cmder, I need to set PIPENV_SHELL to cmder's init.bat file
This files if there is a space in the folder path.
Work Around
Moving cmder's init.bat to a location with no spaces fixes it
