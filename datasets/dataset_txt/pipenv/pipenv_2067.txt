pipenv --update does not update the caller instance, i.e. it always updates the USER_SITE installation (moreover if the installation does not exist it will install there).
If this is the expected behaviour - update documentation, if not - I think it may be a bug.
Example:
pipenv installed in system site packages, when executed, updates ~/.local/
pipenv executed from virtulenv, , when executed, updates ~/.local/
