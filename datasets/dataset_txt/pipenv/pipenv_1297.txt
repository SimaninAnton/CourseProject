Note: After looking at a lot of the answers, I half expect to be told my paths are wrong, but I'd be interested in how that should be fixed as well.
 $ echo $PATH
/Users/savoie/.pyenv/shims:/Users/savoie/.pyenv/bin:/Users/savoie/.rbenv/shims:/Users/savoie/.rbenv/bin:/Users/savoie/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/savoie/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin
Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!).
Describe the issue briefly here.
When I start a new project with no Pipfile or Pipfile.lock in a directory, pipenv is using an included python 3.6 to create my virtual environment.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
I'm using brew installed pipenv so the output is:
/Users/savoie/.pyenv/versions/2.7.14/bin/python: No module named pipenv
$ python -m pipenv.help output
