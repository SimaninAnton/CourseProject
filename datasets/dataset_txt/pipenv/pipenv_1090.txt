Been searching all around but my google skills are failing me.
I have a project in which I have a client and a server which have different package requirements, I'd like to be able to have them be separate in my Pipfile (like its done in [packages] vs [dev-packages]), or maybe have different Pipfiles, not sure how this is usually solved in pipenv. Normally I would have just created several requirements.txt files, but I really really like pipenv's Pipfiles!
So ideally I would be able to do pipenv install --server or pipenv install --client much in the same way I can now do pipenv install/pipenv install --dev.
Is this possible atm?
