I tried today to use pipenv to start a new project based on the pyup command line, but I was unable to install this package, pipenv hangs for ever. I left it running for 30 mins, where pip installs it in less than 1 min.

I'm using pipenv 3.5.3, installed under python 2.7.13. Creating the virtualenv under python 2 or 3 doesn't help.
I've tried to add a print statement in my delegator.run() function, and the command which is hanging is
"/Users/Bruno/.virtualenvs/pipenv_test-efB41TrZ/bin/pip" install "pyupio" -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
As and alternative, I've tried both of the below which worked, but did not update my Pipfile nor Pipfile.lock:
pipenv shell
pip install  "pyupio" -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
pipenv run pip install  "pyupio" -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
Is that a known incompatibility with pyupio or one of its dependencies? Thanks
