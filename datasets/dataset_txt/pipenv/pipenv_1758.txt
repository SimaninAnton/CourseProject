Hey guys, just started using pipenv and I'm loving it. The only thing that I would like to change is that when I run pipenv shell pipenv automatically adds the environment name along with its hash to my command line prompt. It would be great if we could opt out from having the hash being shown there, as I think it is very unnecessary information, and makes me shell uglier.
Thanks for the awesome project!
