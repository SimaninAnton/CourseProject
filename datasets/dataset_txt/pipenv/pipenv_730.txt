Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Like the reporter of #1015, I often switch between multiple environment files (.env for local development, prod.env for accessing a production database, etc.), so I end up prefixing many commands with env PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=prod.env. However, several times I've typed this out and been baffled when the command I run doesn't actually access my prod database, only to realize that I made a typo in the name of the file.
Describe the solution you'd like
It would be nice to show a simple warning when PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION is set to a file that does not exist, and then just continue execution as usual. I think this would be a simple modificiation of pipenv.core.load_dot_env. I'm thinking of a message like: File PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=prod.env does not exist, not loading environment variables or something similar. I'd be happy to submit a PR for this if it's something anybody else would appreciate.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Another option is to exit 1 if the specified dotenv file doesn't exist, but that seems like a bit of an overreaction.
