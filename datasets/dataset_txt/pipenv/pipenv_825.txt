Issue description
I am currently running MacOS Sierra with pyenv that contains versions of Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. When I installed Pipenv, I expected it to use pyenv to install a version of Python that could be isolated. Instead, it installed another version of Python 3.7 from Homebrew. While this may not be that much of a problem, it will mess up the Python paths.
Expected result
Pipenv does not need to install Python from Homebrew, but use pyenv for an isolated python environment.
Actual result
Pipenv installs another version of Python from Homebrew for an isolated environment.
Steps to replicate
Install pyenv from Homebrew: brew install pyenv
Install a couple of versions of Python from pyenv: pyenv install 3.7.0 3.6.5 3.5.5
Install Pipenv from Homebrew: brew install pipenv
$ pipenv --support
