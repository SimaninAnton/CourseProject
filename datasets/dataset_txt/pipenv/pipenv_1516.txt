I want to install package which take ages and lots of RAM to compile from source from wheels instead. I was able to build the wheel just fine on a different machine with the same system.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Docker
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.1.0
Expected result
I expected it to take the find_links option from my Pipfile and pass it to pip when calling pip install
Actual result
It does not pass this option, thus pip starting to build, taking forever and failing with an out of memory error eventually.
Steps to replicate
Add find_links = "wheelhouse/" to your Pipfile [[source]] section.
