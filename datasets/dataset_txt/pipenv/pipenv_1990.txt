I'm working on a project locally on OSX, clean creation of env via pipenv, all necessary packages stored via pipenv install xxx so the Pipfile gets updated accordingly. I'm using Python 2.7.14. I am now trying to replicate this on a VM running Ubuntu 16.04.
I start from a basic Ubuntu image, then run
sudo apt install python-minimal
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install pipenv
clone the git repo containing my project, and then when I try install using pipenv I run into various errors.
The first being
⠋Warning: it looks like pew is not in your PATH. We cannot continue until this is resolved.
which I get around using this SO suggestion
sudo -H pip install pew
then the normal pipenv install and pipenv shell seems to work fine, until I then go to actually run my code and I get
ImportError: No module named functools32
which if I try manually install just leads down the rabbit hole of more dependencies missing. I'm obviously approaching this incorrectly, but I'm not sure how.
These outputs might help
$ which python
> /home/ubuntu/.local/share/virtualenvs/myproject-etz0SGRU/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.12
