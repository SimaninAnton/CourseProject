Issue description
As title
Expected result
After changing the source name in Pipfile and do lock, the index names in Pipfile.lock should update to reflect the change.
Actual result
I have to do lock twice to make the index names change.
Steps to replicate
Given this Pipfile:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
name = "pypi"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
six = "*"
$ pipenv lock, the index name in Pipfile.lock is pypi
Change the source name in Pipfile to test
$ pipenv lock, the index name in Pipfile.lock is still pypi
$ pipenv lock, the index name in Pipfile.lock is test
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
