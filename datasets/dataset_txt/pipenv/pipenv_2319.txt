If I'm maintaining a package that needs to run under multiple python versions, I'd like to be able to pipenv install multiple times, so that I can do: pipenv run --python=python2.7 py.test tests or pipenv run --three py.test tests or ->
Tox. I copied and edited tox.ini from here http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html#tox-automation-project but all the tests in every tox instance were running under the virtualenv of pipenv, instead of it's own created one. So I went 'oldschool' with tox, running outside of pipenv, but it's a shame it doesn't work as the docs say.
