Issue description
In some cases, pipenv outputs TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "type") to str instead of the actual error (or after printing out the actual error). It faces an error while handling the actual error.
Steps to replicate
Set WORKON_HOME to somewhere that current user doesn't have permission for writing to. Example:
WORKON_HOME=/opt/ pipenv install
I encountered the issue on the latest source code from the Github.
