Just now, I am trying to submit a bug where the guide asks me to run
$ python -m pipenv.help
However, it throws below error:
python -m pipenv.help                                                                                              166ms
/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: Error while finding module specification for 'pipenv.help' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pipenv')
I am in macOS and just upgraded pipenv via brew to 2018.6.25
