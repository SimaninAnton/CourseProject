Be sure to check the existing issues, both open and closed.
When using git+ssh://git@github.com/org/repo.git#egg=pkgname, submodules with https are not plainly shown that is why that username is being asked for. Using pipenv run pip install --verbose -e shows:
Running command git reset --hard -q <HASH>
Running command git submodule update --init --recursive -q
Username for 'https://github.com':
I feel that submodule detection should be clear.
Describe your environment
OS Type: RHEL 7.4 64 bit
Python version: 2.7.5
Pipenv version: version 8.3.2
Expected result
pipenv to note that a submodule is asking for username and password.
Actual result
pipenv install asks for user/pw when clone via ssh, when it should note the initial clone was via if --versbose is given to install, and a submodule is being checked out.
