I'm considering adding to the docs a note about the shell being launched interactively.
For us Mac / bash users out there, we don't get a .bashrc by default, but would need to create one in order to keep our shell's look and feel upon entering the pipenv shell subprocess.
Something like, this in the Advanced / About Shell Config section:
--
The shell launched in interactive mode. This means that if your shell reads its configuration from a specific file for interactive mode (e.g. bash by default looks for a ~/.bashrc configuration file for interactive mode), then you'll need to modify this file. For Mac users, you'll need to create a .bashrc file.
