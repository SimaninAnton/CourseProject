In your Dockerfile you have RUN apt update and RUN apt install ... in separate lines. This is not recommended, since docker's caching can cause old versions of your packages to get installed.
From the docs:
Always combine RUN apt-get update with apt-get install in the same RUN statement. For example:
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       package-bar \
       package-baz \
       package-foo
Using apt-get update alone in a RUN statement causes caching issues and subsequent apt-get install instructions fail.
