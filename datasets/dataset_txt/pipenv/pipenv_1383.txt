First of all, thanks for improving Python packaging. I'm experimenting with Pipenv on some side projects before bringing it into my team's mainline dev workflow.
Brief description
$ pipenv update does not update library when a ref is changed in the Pipfile
Pipfile Snippet 1:
python-binance = {git = "git://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance.git", ref = "e1be0e17921965c1d34e8dbccac522e55fa0f4ac"}
Pipfile Snippet 2:
python-binance = {git = "git://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance.git", ref = "d35b2bb0e1c4cd4d8b9042fc130d82c041fe3c3c"}
Expected result
I assumed that by changing the ref in Pipfile to a different commit hash and running $ pipenv update that the old verison of the library would have been removed and the new version would have been installed.
# Expected result:
$ pip list | grep binance 
python-binance        0.6.6
Actual result
The old version stayed in place.
# Actual result:
$ pip list | grep binance 
python-binance        0.6.3
Steps to replicate
# With old Pipfile:
$ pipenv update
...
$ pip list | grep binance 
python-binance        0.6.3

# With new Pipfile:
$ pipenv update
...
$ pip list | grep binance
python-binance        0.6.3
Environment:
Pipenv version: `'11.6.1'`
