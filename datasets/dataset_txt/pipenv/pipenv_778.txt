Hi,
I'd like to allow multiple python versions on a project.
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
In the current case, my production environments are in 3.7 (docker image python:slim-stretch) while python 3.7 is not yet available in my dev environments (archlinux).
But I'm pretty sure that my project will work equally on 3.6 and 3.7, and would like to avoid installing and using another interpreter.
Also, I am using features like f-strings which are not available in 3.5, so I can't specify python_version ="3", because on other dev environments like xenial, one must install an interpreter >=3.6.
Describe the solution you'd like
Allowing a version string in Pipfile, like:
[requires]
python_version = ">=3.6"
Describe alternatives you've considered
We could also allow a list, like python_version = "3.6,3.7".
$ pipenv --support
