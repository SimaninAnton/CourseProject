Hello, i have just create project environment with pipenv install with this Pipfile:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]
django-debug-toolbar = "*"
pytest = "*"
pytest-django = "*"
coverage = "*"
tox = "*"
mock = "*"

[packages]
Django = "*"
django-allauth = "*"
django-ckeditor = "*"
django-cleanup = "*"
django-cmstemplates = "*"
django-codemirror-widget = "*"
django-el-pagination = "*"
django-widget-tweaks = "*"
easy-thumbnails = "*"
envvars = "*"

ipython = "*"
lxml = "*"
psycopg2 = "*"
pymorphy2-dicts-ru = "*"
pytils = "*"

[packages.pymorphy2]
extra = [ "fast",]
Then i launched django project (manage.py) and got an error that pymorphy2 is not installed, but it is declared in Pipfile.
Then i tried to install it with pipenv install pymorphy2 being inside in virtual environment and got this error: Error: 2.
