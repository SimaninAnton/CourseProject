Right now the documentation for Pipfile states the naming conventions are Pipfile and Pipfile.freeze but the current API implementation here is using the original Pipfile.lock. It looks like freeze was the decision in pypa/pipfile#43, but perhaps things have changed since then. It seems like one of the repositories is out of sync with the current naming convention though.
