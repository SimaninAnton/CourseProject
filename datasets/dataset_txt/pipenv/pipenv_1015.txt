Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Given how pipenv uses a verb command interface, it feels wrong that to get a help/command summary you need to invoke it with --help instead of pipenv help.
Describe the solution you'd like
Enable pipenv help to work. Can be shared with the --help output. This maps better in terms of usability.
If okay, I can put a PR together for this.
