Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It's not clear how to remove virtual environments from pipenv. I've found the --rm option (why an option?) in the issue tracker just before opening a feature request.
Describe the solution you'd like
Deprecate --rm option; pipenv destroy should be the preferred way for destroying virtualenv's.
