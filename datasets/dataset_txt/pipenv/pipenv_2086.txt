Hi!
I think pipenv might be trying to install a package from extras_require that has a conditional dependency looking like this ":python_version=='2.7'": ["functools32"], when running python 3 you can see full setup.py here
Result is that it is crashing during the locking
pip.exceptions.InstallationError: Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /var/folders/sf/3jbs_z291zj5sh_mc967y1_r0000gn/T/tmpJmGecKbuild/functools32/

pipenv, version 7.9.2
minimal reproducible commands
mkdir testenv
cd testenv
pipenv --three
pipenv install jsonschema
