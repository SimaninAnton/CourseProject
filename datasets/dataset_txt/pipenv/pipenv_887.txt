There was an error in pipenv after I upgraded python by brew upgrade python and deleted old version by brew cleanup.
To solve the problem, I have to run pipenv --rm and reinstall pipenv by pipenv install and this will installs all packages installed before.
So is there an easy way to upgrade python version in pipenv?
