When I run "pipenv install {package}" all the package names in the Pipfile are lower-cased.
However, when I run "pipenv uninstall {package}" many of the names are changed back to their mixed case form.
This creates a lot of noise in change logs.
$ python -m pipenv.help
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Consistent casing for both install / uninstall.
Actual result
 flower = "*"
-flask = "*"
-flask-xml-rpc = "*"
-flask-restful = "*"
+Flask = "*"
+Flask-XML-RPC = "*"
+Flask-RESTful = "*"
 pytest-flask = "*"
