Note: https://kenneth-reitz.uservoice.com/forums/913660-general says "This site is not currently active" and I think this query is too speculative for StackOverflow, so I've posted the query here. (If there's an official answer, then it stops being speculative ;D )
From the (excellent) documentation, setup.py is really intended for Python libraries, packages that are imported by other packages. Obviously if I am building a Python library and uploading it to PyPI, I must create a setup.py. (In addition to my existing pipfile as required for pipenv.)
If I am building a local application, the documentation explains I don't need setup.py -- only pipfile.
But what if I am building an application and uploading it to PyPI? For example, so that a user can pip install --user myapp and then launch myapp. Do I still need setup.py in this case, or will the pip install succeed with just a pipfile?
