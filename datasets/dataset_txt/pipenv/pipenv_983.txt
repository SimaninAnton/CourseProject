@techalchemy I've been using pipenv for months using PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL to point to our own private packages in our own index.
pipenv never added this url to the Pipfile, but i've noticed it recently has started to. Not sure if this has been due to some update to pipenv or due to me switching to pip.conf files (instead of using environment variables--see below) to specify the extra-index-url.
This is not ideal, because this url contains a "secret" token and so should ideally not be on version control (it'd be nice to avoid using yet another tool, e.g. git-crypt to deal with this).
Any ideas/suggestions?
Why pip.conf?
The reason I had to switch to pip.conf was that pip/pipenv suddenly stopped "respecting" the PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environtment variable. I realize this is likely outside the scope of pipenv, since I can't reproduce this myself on different setups (i.e. this suddenly happened when I switched to ubuntu 18) but would appreciate any ideas/help on how to resolve it.
