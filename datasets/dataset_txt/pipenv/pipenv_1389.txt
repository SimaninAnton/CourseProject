I'm trying to switch from virtualenvwrapper to pipenv, and find I really miss the aliasses. I know I can use them together, but I find that I would really like to leave virtualenvwrapper behind (for various reasons).
What I'm missing most is support for workon, cdsitepackages, cdproject. Is there any chance these can be included as subcommands in pipenv? To be more precise, I think cdsitepackages, cdproject could/ should still be aliasses once you have pipenv shell . But especially workon is something im dearly missing.
