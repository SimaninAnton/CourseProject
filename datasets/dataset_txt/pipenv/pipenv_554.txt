Hi,
I use pyenv to manage my python versions and noticed that my pipenv install --python 3.7.0's were failing. Turns out if was because pythonfinder wasn't able to parse python versions with an interpreter name prefix and I'd recently installed an anaconda interpreter via pyenv.
Anyway, this has been resolved:
sarugaku/pythonfinder#15
sarugaku/pythonfinder#17
Would be great if pipenv could update the pythonfinder vendor dependancy.
edit
There may be some extra work on pipenv's side, now that python finder could return a bunch more (maybe unsupported) interpreters. e.g. ironpython, pypy, anaconda, micropython etc.
Thanks
