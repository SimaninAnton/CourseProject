Hi there, I've poked my head in on this project to check it out, but I'm having some trouble on my work machine.
Describe your environment
Windows 10 Pro
Python version: Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 11.1.5
Happens in both Powershell and CMD, but not in bash (probably due to Linux Subsystem for Windows uses a different home directory path, that doesn't have spaces in the name)
Expected result
pipenv to create the environment
Actual result
PS D:\Projects\Django\feedback> pipenv --verbose install
Error: no such option: --verbose
PS D:\Projects\Django\feedback> pipenv install --verbose
Creating a Pipfile for this project…
Pipfile.lock not found, creating…
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies…

'C:\Users\First' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I've removed my actual name from the output, but to add here, my user folder path is
"C:\Users\First Last"
Steps to replicate
cd D:\Projects\Django\feedback
pipenv install --verbose
