This is more question, sorry for that but I can't find any information about support for stackless version of python.
Is stackless is supported by pipenv? I don't have any problem with stackless version of python interpreter (pyenv is working fine), but when I'm trying to configure project by pipenv with stackless as interpreter something is going wrong.
