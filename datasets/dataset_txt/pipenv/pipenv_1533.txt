It would be great if python3 -m pipenv worked in order to support Windows users better as neither pipsi nor --user installs are accessible by default. As it currently stands there's a message about pew needing to be on the PATH, although there's an environment variable called PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT which doesn't seem to have a corresponding command-line flag (I also didn't think to test if this removed the pew warning before leaving work today).
