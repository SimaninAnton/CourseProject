Since the --dev flag is used to mark out packages that are for development environments, why not use it with run/shell for the same purpose? Perhaps a .env.dev that gets loaded after .env if pipenv run --dev or pipenv shell --dev is run.
The reason for this is that Django has a DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable, and I think many who follow this Taskbuster Tutorial would use it to set DEBUG = True at some point. The tutorial still uses virtualenvs to switch between dev and production.
(Not sure if this is more of a best practices problem or a feature suggestion...)
