Do you think a requirements.txt file should live alongside a Pipenv file?
I am aware pipenv can import dependencies from the requirements.txt file "and forget about it". I was thinking more of a scenario where people and/or tools wouldn't use pipenv on a machine but would still fallback to pip. Think "legacy package users" here, if that makes any sense.
Would you advise on doing whilst pipenv (hopefully) takes over the old ways of managing dependencies and virtual environments?
Thank you in advance.
