I have fish's pipenv plugin installed, which automatically activates pipenv shell when i cd in to the directory
but this means i have to type exit or install pipenv inside my virtualenv if i want to install a new package using pipenv inside pipenv shell
Is there any good way to overcome this wired pattern?
