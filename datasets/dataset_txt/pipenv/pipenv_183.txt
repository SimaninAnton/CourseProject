Issue description
I am using mac Mojave, with pipenv it's a clean install. I am running python version 3.7.3 and pipenv version: pipenv, version 2018.11.26. If I create a new Pipenv environment it keeps dropping to (personalblog) bash-3.2$ instead of staying in actual shell. I always get this
Expected result
The pipenv shall show the prompt something like this :
(personalblog)Himanshus-MacBook-Pro:personalblog himanshupatel
Actual result
I always get something like:
Launching subshell in virtual environment…
bash-3.2$ . /Users/himanshupatel/personalblog/.venv/bin/activate
(personalblog) bash-3.2$
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
