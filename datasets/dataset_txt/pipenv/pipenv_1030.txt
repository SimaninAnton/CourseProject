I saw what appeared to be a similar issue, but only about the path to the shell containing a space.
Running pipenv install fails if the path to the venv directory contains a space. For example:
Error:  An error occurred while installing flask!
/bin/sh: /Volumes/Promise6TB/Development/contract manager/.venv/bin/pip: "/Volumes/Promise6TB/Development/contract: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
Note how the "path" to the interpreter stops at the space - obviously the path isn't being escaped properly.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
------------
Expected result
Spaces should be properly escaped, and install should work
Actual result
The error above
Steps to replicate
Just create a .venv folder in a directory containing a space, and try running.
