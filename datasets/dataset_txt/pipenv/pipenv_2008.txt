I have just setup a python project using pipenv. One thing I want to know is where does pipenv store the mapping of project directories to virtualenvs.
To be clear, I am running the following command:
sacjain-macOS:coursera-classification sacjain$ pipenv --venv
/Users/sachinjain/.local/share/virtualenvs/coursera-classification-iTBt6WsT
I checked Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, I assumed this information should be present in Pipfile but it was not there.
Q2. How can we install a specific version of package using pipenv ?
