Hello
I really prefer pipenv to handle Pipfile and Pipfile.lock over the old requirements.txt, however, my packages that uses pipenv (ex: here), when installed with pip install txrwlock, get no dependency at all.
I wonder if, for the moment at least, auto-generating a requirements.txt is not necessary, at least waiting for official support of Pipfile by pip (and other tools such as ReadTheDoc or Pyup that only support requirements.txt).
What's your thoughts?
