On Windows, Python is not put on PATH by default. Instead the py command is made available which operates somewhat like pipenv --three where a single command handles executing different Python versions. It would be great if pipenv picked up on py -- or Python versions installed by reading the Windows registry -- instead of only looking for python on PATH.
