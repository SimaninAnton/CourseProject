Colors are so nice, but what is their meaning?
Running pipenv -h I can see that some commands are in red, some are in green, or yellow or purple, but I could not find anywhere in the doc a description about what each color means (sorry if I missed it!).
I suspect the color is associated with the effects of the commands (e.g. in red they do not modify Pipenv or Pipenv.lock, in green they will edit both, in purple they will modify only Pipenv), but this is not obvious as it should be.
Is it possible to clarify this and include it clearly in the docs?
