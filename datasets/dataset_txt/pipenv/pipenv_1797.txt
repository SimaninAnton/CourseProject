Background
When generating a new virtualenv in a new project, if you have a Pipfile in a parent directory, it will create a virtualenv for that directory.
Problem
If people have a Pipfile that they are not aware of (e.g., at their $HOME, due to a cp error or whatever), they may start a witch hunt
Goal / Feature request
Inform the user in a clear way about the Pipfile that's being read.
PS: I can implement this myself and send a PR, but only if this idea looks good for the project
