In an effort to reduce duplication it would be nice if setup.py could get the install_requires items from an API.
For a library where you want to be a little loose with the requirements (i.e. non-pinned)
# setup.py
from pipenv.api import install_requirements

setup(
    install_requires=install_requirements()
)
For an application distributed via setup.py, a little tighter
# setup.py
from pipenv.api import install_requirements

setup(
    install_requires=install_requirements(pinned=True)
)
