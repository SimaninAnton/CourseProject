Expected result
I have a .env file with these contents:
FOO_ONE=
FOO_TWO=
I expect these two environment variables to be created with empty values when running pipenv run:
$ pipenv run env | grep -i foo
Loading .env environment variables…
FOO_ONE=
FOO_TWO=
The reason I expect this is because that's the way source .env works in Bash, and that's also the way python-dotenv works.
Actual result
$ pipenv run env | grep -i foo
Loading .env environment variables…
FOO_ONE=FOO_TWO=
The actual result was that the environment variable FOO_ONE was set to FOO_TWO=, and the environment variable FOO_TWO was not created.
Debugging information
$ python -m pipenv.help output
