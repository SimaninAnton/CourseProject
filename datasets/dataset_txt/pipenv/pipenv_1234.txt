pipenv install -e . puts the following line in Pipfile:
"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
which makes uninstalling the package hard – pipenv uninstall . doesn't work ("no package . to remove from Pipfile"), and pipenv uninstall e1839a8 doesn't actually uninstall the package (it removes it from Pipfile, but pip list still shows it as installed).
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Ideally, Pipenv would put the package's name in Pipfile, so it can be uninstalled properly with minimal pain. If that's not possible, would "." work?
Actual result
The name of the package is listed as e1839a8 – the last 7 hex digits of the SHA-256 hash of . – which is essentially meaningless.
Steps to replicate
pipenv install -e .
pipenv uninstall .  # doesn't work
pipenv update .  # doesn't work
