I want to access a pipenv lock as how it would be generated if would be generate on a speicifc date. For example I want add a new package and this would also update many of the other packages by being able to control not taking newer versions than a given date I would be able to add packages easierly.
Describe the solution you'd like
If running a pipenv lock --on 2019/08/22 I expect that the lock file would be generated in same way as if I were to press pipenv lock on the 2019/08/22. So just ignoring all versions of packages after the lock_date which is set by the --on keyword (I would not be against renaming it to lock_date).
