On many linux distros, after upgrading from e.g python3.5 to python3.6, all the vritualenvs created with python3.5 suddenly become usable.
The errors vary across distributions, but a simple workaround is simply to re-create the vritualenvs by hand:
$ cd /path/to/venv/created/with/3.5
$ virtualenv .
It would be nice if pipenv could help in this case, maybe by having a pipenv recreate or just a pipenv clean command.
Thoughts ?
