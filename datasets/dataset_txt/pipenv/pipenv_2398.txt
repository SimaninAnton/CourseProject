For example, to generate requirements.txt for legacy deployments. Of course, installing all the development dependencies is an option, but it can be hard (i. e. Fabric depends on cryptography which needs some C headers installed, but we don't need Fabric on the server in first place).
This can be tricky, though, depending on how we generate the current pipenv lock -r output.
