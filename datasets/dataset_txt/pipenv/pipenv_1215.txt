Steps to replicate
Pipfile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
PyGObject = "*"
pydocstyle = "*"
pyserial = "*"

[dev-packages]
"flake8" = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
Include a tput command in your bashrc (PS1). Watch the magic happen.
