I was looking at pytest-pypi at https://pypi.org/project/pytest-pypi/
The website points to https://github.com/kennethreitz/pytest-pypi and that is 404
The README looks like copy paste from pytest-httpbin.
Is the upstream of this PyPI project at https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/tree/master/tests/pytest-pypi ?
Can the README, DESCRIPTION.rst (= long description on PyPI) and URL by updated?
Thanks
