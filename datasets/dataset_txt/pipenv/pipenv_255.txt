As of #3298 pipenv will resolve the dependencies of all VCS and File dependencies, whether or not they are editable. In order to allow users to troubleshoot any conflicts that arise that are accidentally dependent upon the old behavior, we need to provide a toggle to allow them to disable resolution for non-editable dependencies.
