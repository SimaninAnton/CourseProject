Issue Description:
When I attempt to call pipenv shell, it does not create the virtual env and fails with an error.
Pretty sure this is related to closed issue 3363.
Steps to replicate
I've got a fresh install of Windows 10, with the windows Ubuntu utility.
The python version on my Windows install is 3.7.3. The python version on Ubuntu is 3.6.8, and there is no alias for python --
kate@orion:/mnt/c/Users/kate$ python --version

Command 'python' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python
sudo apt install python-minimal

You also have python3 installed, you can run 'python3' instead.
I'm going to go attempt to fix this by adjusting my PATH variable, but I figured it was worth mentioning as this is my experience with freshly installed, out of the box a) windows, b) the linux on windows supported experience c) python on windows.
pipenv --support output from the bash shell (ubuntu)
$ pipenv --support
