When installing a requirements file that contains -e … (with a space after -e) you get an error:
Installing -e git+https://github.com/django/django@…
Error: An error occurred while installing -e git+https://github.com/django/django@…
For --editable= git+https://github.com/django/django@… only git+URL, hg+URL, svn+URL, bzr+URL is currently supported
(similar to #66, where -r with space afterwards is not handled)
