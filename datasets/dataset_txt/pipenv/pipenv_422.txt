Issue description
With the latest version of pipenv (2018.11.14) pipenv lock -r does not produce a valid requirements.txt file if pipenv install has not been run previously.
Expected result
With the previous release if I ran pipenv lock -r requirements.txt it would first create the virtualenv and then produce a valid requirements file.
Actual result
The first lines of the produced requirements.txt are shown below. I guess that the first line is mistakenly printed to stdout instead of stderr.
