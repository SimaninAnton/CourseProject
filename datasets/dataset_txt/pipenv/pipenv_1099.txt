Pipenv seems to provide functions that use pyenv, however, it is not clear I should use pyenv's shims.
Some guides suggest it but the procedure on the official document doesn't include it.
I think writing recommended way to setup pyenv on the official document is helpful.
For example, for bash user
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
just adding this on ~/.bash_profile is enough to fully utilize pipenv features?
