I tried to use twitter-scraper. I ran the command described in the README:
pipenv install twitter-scraper
I got this error back:
❯ pipenv install twitter-scraper
Installing twitter-scraper…

Steps to replicate
I ran pipenv install twitter-scraper. But it seems that in my case all instances of pipenv install are broken. Not sure what to do.
Thank you for any help.
