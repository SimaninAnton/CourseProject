Expected result
I ran pipenv install nose --dev --keep-outdated, expecting to install nose but nothing else.
Actual result
python-dateutil was also updated, and pycodestyle's hashes changed.
I'm especially confused as to why those two: pipenv update --dry-run tells me I have several other packages that need updates too, and pipenv graph tells me nose has no dependencies (and I think it's right).
Note that we have a VCS dependency, but it has no dependencies itself, so I think this is unrelated to the other issues with --keep-outdated and VCS deps.
Here are the changes it made:
git diff

Here's the full verbose output of the above command:
pipenv install nose --dev --keep-outdated --verbose
Steps to replicate
With the linked Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, and after running pipenv sync --dev && pipenv check to confirm things are all as expected, run pipenv install nose --dev --keep-outdated.
