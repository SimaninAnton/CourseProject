As mentioned in #2458, when I'm running pipenv install --verbose in a folder which currently doesn't have a virtual environment, and where 'redis' is the only package specified in Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, I get the output from the pip command twice, in both yellow and blue, as shown in this screenshot (I had to make it quite small to fit it on one screen):
This is presumably because the pip output contains the word "Ignoring" and me specifying --verbose. Both triggers the printing of the output, as per this code:
pipenv/pipenv/core.py
Lines 727 to 730 in 8691c71
 if 'Ignoring' in c.out: 
     click.echo(crayons.yellow(c.out.strip())) 
 if verbose: 
     click.echo(crayons.blue(c.out or c.err)) 
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
The output should only be printed once, probably in yellow since I guess that output is intended to be a bit of a warning, even though it's not that clear from a user perspective why it's printed, unless you look at the source code.
Actual result
The output from pip is printed twice, first in yellow and then in blue.
Steps to replicate
Place the following content inside Pipfile in a folder and run pipenv install --verbose:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
redis = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
Note: This will only work if you get lines such as "Ignoring unknown cache-control directive" in the output from pip. I'm getting it on macOS.
