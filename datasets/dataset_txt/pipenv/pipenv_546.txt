Issue description
Pipenv lock succeeds but violates a condition on one of the dependencies, specifically pytest (that is the one I've noticed, there may be others). From my inspection of the verbose output, I looks like the requirement just falls off at some point rather there being any conflict.
Happy to provide further information as and when needed.
P. S. I know I need to unpin the dependencies, and I will :)
Expected result
pytest==3.6.4

Result of round 4: stable, done

Updated Pipfile.lock (9065aa)!
Steps to replicate
pipenv lock
I did a pipenv lock --clear but it made no difference
$ pipenv --support
