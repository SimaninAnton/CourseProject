I am using the Pipfile included below. Running pipenv install with no Pipfile.lock succeeds, but the next time I run it, after Pipfile.lock has been generated, I get the following error:
Pipfile.lock out of date, updating...
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies...
Locking [packages] dependencies...
Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock...
An error occured while installing!
Double requirement given: python-dateutil==2.2 (from -r /tmp/tmp2za0_8kx-requirements.txt (line 16)) (already in python_dateutil==2.6.0 (from -r /tmp/tmp2za0_8kx-requirements.txt (line 10)), name='python-dateutil')
I assume this is because two packages in my Pipfile are requiring different versions of python-dateutil. I'm not sure if this is something that pipenv should handle, but in any case, the error message generated doesn't give me any information that I can use to solve the problem.
Is this something pipenv could handle better?
