Issue description
I was investigating some weird action-at-a-distance problem where deleting everything in ~/.local/shared/virtualenvs changed the output of:
python3.6 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pipenv

PIPENV_PIPFILE=~/path/to/my/Pipfile pipenv sync
pipenv run pipdeptree
(Quite weird! But not the concern of this issue)
When I ran into this bit of pipenv source code
pipenv/pipenv/utils.py
Line 1382 in 1b86564
 if "requirements.txt": 
That's always going to be True, so it's doing nothing. Also Returns the path of a Pipfile in the docstring should be Returns the path of a requirements.txt file.
Easy things to clean up
