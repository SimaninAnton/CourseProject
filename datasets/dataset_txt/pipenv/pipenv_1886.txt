When installing from a git URL (e.g. pipenv install git+https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia) you get an error saying you need a #egg fragment with a full traceback.
It would be a lot more user friendly to report the problem with a proper error message and no traceback, as it's likely to be a common beginner issue (projects typically don't mention a #egg fragment when asking users to try the github version).
