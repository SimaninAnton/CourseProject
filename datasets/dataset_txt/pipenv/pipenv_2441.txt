My typical workflow involves installing my package with pip's editable mode, i.e.
/path/to/my/project$ pip install -e .
Which is how I get my dependencies - from my setup.py install_requires section. Mainly because I have console scripts setup.
Is this orthogonal to pipenv, or is there any (planned) support for this type of workflow?
