Hi guys,
It is not clear for me possible scenarios of using pipenv. It would be nice document a kind of good practices.
For example coexisting of setup.py and pipenv. When do we need setup.py etc.
This is a follow-up from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47227406/pipenv-vs-setup-py/47594760#47594760
Thank you
