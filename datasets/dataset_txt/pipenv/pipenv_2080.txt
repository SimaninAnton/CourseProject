I was working on a new project at /home/roger/test and installing sqlalchemy:
~/test 
➜ pipenv install sqlalchemy
Installing sqlalchemy…
Collecting sqlalchemy
Installing collected packages: sqlalchemy
Successfully installed sqlalchemy-1.1.14

Adding sqlalchemy to Pipfile's [packages]…
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies…
Locking [packages] dependencies…
Updated Pipfile.lock!

~/test took 33s 
➜ ls
<few files, but no Pipfile and Pipfile.lock found>
After several tries of uninstalling and reinstalling sqlalchemy, I discovered that I had used pipenv within my home directory. Shame for me it took more than 5 minutes.
~/test
➜ pipenv --where
/home/roger
After removing the virtualenv from my home directory, everything run fine.
May I suggest that pipenv show the full path of Pipfile and Pipenv.lock whenever they are modified?

Updated /home/roger/Pipfile.lock!
It may help saving time for others users... :)
