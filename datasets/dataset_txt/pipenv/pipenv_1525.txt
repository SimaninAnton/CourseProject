It may be handful to proxy some other pip commands to work with pipenv.
Freeze
Expected result
Resolve and freeze all dependencies from Pipfile to "requirements.txt format".
$ pipenv freeze --dev
requests==2.18.4
Current workaround
Requires installation before freezing.
$ pipenv install --dev
$ pipenv run pip freeze
requests==2.18.4
Download
Expected result
Resolve and download all packages from Pipfile to some destination directory.
$ pipenv download --dev -d ./dest
Current workaround
Requires installation and freezing before downloading.
$ pipenv install --dev
$ pipenv run pip freeze > requirements.txt
$ pipenv run pip download -d ./dest -r requirements.txt
