Hi guys,
I was thinking in the possibility of add support to check code quality in pipenv. Integrating some tool like flake8 or pycodestyle might be cool.
It could be something like:
$ pipenv pep8
Or could be inside command check. But anyway, it's something I'm interested in implementing. What do you think?
