This is a feature request, not a bug, so I'm not using the template. I searched the open/closed issues for mention of this, but couldn't find anything. If this request already exists, I apologize.
I would like for pipenv to support multiple environment files, a la Honcho and Foreman. For many workflows I'm aware of, it's beneficial to have a default .env file checked in to the repository, along with .env.local files on developer machines, with secrets and such. Based on my reading of the docs (and no further digging, sorry), pipenv doesn't seem to support this. Could it?
