Evaluating the autocomplete takes a very long time (closer to a second).
eval "$(env _PIPENV_COMPLETE=source-bash pipenv)"
Autocompletions also take closer to a second, as does running pretty much any command (no matter how simple).
I had to disable the autocompletion as it adds too much time to my terminals startup (actually I just took the output of the command to my .bashrc for now).
Describe you environment
Linux (Ubuntu 17.04)
Python version: Python 3.5.3
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 8.2.7
Expected result
These simple commands shouldn't take more than a few milliseconds.
Steps to replicate
$ time env _PIPENV_COMPLETE=source-bash pipenv --verbose

_pipenv_completion() {
    local IFS=$'\t'
    COMPREPLY=( $( env COMP_WORDS="${COMP_WORDS[*]}" \
                   COMP_CWORD=$COMP_CWORD \
                   _PIPENV_COMPLETE=complete-bash $1 ) )
    return 0
}

complete -F _pipenv_completion -o default pipenv
