I somehow doubt this is an issue with pipenv, as it works as expected on the Windows7 machine at work. But on my OSX 10.12.6, with pyenv-installed pythons and homebrew-installed pipenv, issues arise:
I create a .venv with pipenv and run pipenv shell, but the virtual environment doesn't activate... python and pip are still the global commands.
I could use some help figuring what I did wrong.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
/usr/bin/python: No module named pipenv
(This is output after pipenv shell)
Expected result
Running pipenv shell should let you run python and pip being the commands from within the environment.
Actual result
python and pip use the global commands.
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
