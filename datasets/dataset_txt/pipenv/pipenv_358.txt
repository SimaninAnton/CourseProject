i got 2 pipenv one just works and the other one breaks with the below message. i compared the Pipfiles and they both are using the same version of python.
not sure why this specific environment is corrupt. i have attempted several time to rm then install again with no luck
thanks in advance
 pipenv update
Running $ pipenv lock then $ pipenv sync.
