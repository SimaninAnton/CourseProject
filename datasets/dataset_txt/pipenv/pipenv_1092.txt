A package that I included in my Pipfile failed to install when I ran pipenv install, so pipenv failed with the message
pip.exceptions.InstallationError: Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in <source directory>
Would it be a good idea for pipenv to show more information when the install fails (possibly behind the --verbose flag)?
(By the way, I'm getting this error with a local dependency—not sure if that makes a difference.)
