Trying to install a local file-backed distribution on Heroku. Previously, using standard pip/requirements.txt Heroku detected setup.py and installed the local package automatically. Now, using pipenv, with the same structure, it does not automatically detect setup.py for some reason. Per the Heroku docs I need to provide a path to the local distribution to the requirements.txt. Or, add -e . to provoke pip to run python setup.py develop What is the pipenv equivalent?
Apologies if requiring local packages is addressed in the docs, but I didn't see it...
Python 3.6.2
pipenv, version 8.2.7
Heroku
Package installation using normal setup.py install command works fine both locally and on Heroku.
pipenv run setup.py install
heroku python setup.py install
Top-level directory structure looks like this:
├── Pipfile
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── bin
├── resources
├── runtime.txt
├── setup.py
├── src
│   └── pblc
│   ├── init.py
│   ├── main.py
├── (package files)
└── test
Tried:
pipenv install path/to/setup.py
which in my case is just
pipenv install setup.py
Expected it to add the path to the Pipfile as a requirement
Got the following traceback:
(backend_app-Nxg7F8OH) katestohr:backend_app kate$ pipenv install setup.py
Installing setup.py…
Collecting setup.py

Error:  An error occurred while installing setup.py!
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement setup.py (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for setup.py
Any guidance on the best way to require a local package in Pipfile...?
