Pipenv is awesome, however there are a few things that make it a bit tough to work with in our development environment. I'm trying to figure out how to make it work properly with pre-commit. Since pipenv doesn't use shims, it seems that, for example, pylint doesn't realize which virtual environment it is (so, for example, it'll fail with import-errors because it doesn't realize what packages are installed). One solution is to explicitly set PYTHONPATH to recognize the virtual environment, but that's kind of a pain in the ass. Another solution is to just ignore import-errors. That's a reasonable workaround for now I guess.
Any suggestions for this kind of workflow? Is there a simple way to add add shims to pipenv?
