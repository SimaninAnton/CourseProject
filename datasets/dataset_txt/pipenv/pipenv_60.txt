Issue description
Windows 10 platform
Python 3.6.9
after installing pip, and trying to set up a new pipenv by
> pipenv install
all works well
However, the created environment cann't activate by "pipenv run" nor "pipenv shell", it gave system error that "system can not find specific path"
The created virtualenv can be activated directly in command
I cannot replicate this issue on another computer, for this problem computer, I even tried reinstall python, but it seems there is something wrong with the operating system.
$ pipenv --support
