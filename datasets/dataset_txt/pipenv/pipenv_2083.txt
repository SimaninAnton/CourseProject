Thanks for your work on pipenv!
I have some question as I'm struggling to understand if I can use pipenv in my workflow. I am a conda user and I am pretty familiar with conda environments but I have rarely used virtualenvs.
Can pipenv be used together within a conda/anaconda installation?
I tried to install pipenv but I get an error about virtualenvs:
⠋Using base prefix '/Users/anto/miniconda3'
New python executable in /Users/anto/.local/share/virtualenvs/phconvert-LTUxcv-Y/bin/python
ERROR: The executable /Users/anto/.local/share/virtualenvs/phconvert-LTUxcv-Y/bin/python is not functioning
ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is '/Users/anto/.local/share/virtualenvs' (should be '/Users/anto/.local/share/virtualenvs/phconvert-LTUxcv-Y')
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable
