Currently processing the Pipfile only supports injecting environemnt variables in the [source] section of the file.
For private Github repos it is not possible to use the environment variables because the URL is not parsed.
Would there be support for a PR to parse the URL for VCS entries?
... or would someone on the project be willing to add that?
