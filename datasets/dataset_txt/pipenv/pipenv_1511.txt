My team has switched over from pip / requirements.txt to pipenv / Pipfile, and it's mostly been smooth for us.
However, the auto-generated names for venvs that's shown in the prompt is upsetting people's workflows. They feel they're no longer meaningful as they once were.
I assume the original plan was it would adopt the name of the project directory it was in and this be meaningful, but for some environments that doesn't work.
