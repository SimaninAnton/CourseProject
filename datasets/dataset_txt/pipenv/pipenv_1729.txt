Describe your environment
OS Type: macOS
Python version: 2.7.14
Pipenv version: 9.0.0
Expected result
pipenv install --verbose to print the name of packages being built/installed as that happen, so that I can link a pip exception to a specific package.
At least, something more being printed when I pass in --verbose.
Actual result
$ pipenv install
Pipfile.lock not found, creating…
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies…
Locking [packages] dependencies…
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
pip.exceptions.InstallationError: Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /var/folders/fq/1chpjqw56lv8zq8n14cbn4k40000gn/T/tmpqZz4fybuild/functools32/
$ pipenv install --verbose

On a related note, functools32 doesn't really work with pipenv, but that's their fault.
