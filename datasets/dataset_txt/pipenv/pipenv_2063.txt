I'm using pipenv for a package that's expected to build on the user's system (it has a variety of optimizations). It takes quite a while to build, and outputs a series of details. With pip, I can install in verbose mode (pip install -v -e .) and I can see the output from scikit-build (cmake). However, the --verbose flag for pipenv doesn't activate the pip verbose mode flag, causing the system to provide no output during the build.
Could either --verbose add pip's verbose flag, or could a new flag be added to get a verbose pip build?
(Ideally, I'd be happiest if the Pipfile could instruct pip that this should always output the build messages)
