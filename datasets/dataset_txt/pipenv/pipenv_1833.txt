hi all, currently when pyenv versions has multiple version of python 3, it deterministically chooses the lowest python version. i.e. 3.5.3 will be chosen over 3.6.3. I think a reasonable default will be to reverse this order and use the latest version instead. when I'm not specifying the python version and just run pipenv install on a new project, I almost always mean to use the latest version installed.
happy to submit a PR if you think this is a good idea
thanks!
