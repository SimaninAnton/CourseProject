Notice the shell decoration gets overwritten with pipenv? However if I manually activate from the .venv it works as expected.
17:40:24-rene~/tmp/pipenv$ pipenv shell
Spawning environment shell (/bin/bash).
(pipenv)source /Users/rene/tmp/pipenv/.venv/bin/activate
(pipenv)(pipenv)exit
17:40:35-rene~/tmp/pipenv$ . ./.venv/bin/activate
(pipenv)17:40:47-rene~/tmp/pipenv$ 
The line:
(pipenv)(pipenv)exit
Should be:
(pipenv)17:40:47-rene~/tmp/pipenv$ 
I guess it could be something to do with my setup. Not sure. (osx, homebrew python 3.6).
