Pipenv fails to install and sync latest version of pyarrow on linux. As far as I could tell this is due to a difference between their versioning of the latest release:
linux, windows: 0.9.0 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarrow)
macOS: 0.9.0.post1 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarrow/0.9.0.post1)
When I attempt to install pyarrow on a linux, pipenv returns the following:
And on a macOS, it works:
Howerver if I specify the version to: pyarrow==0.9.0
On linux, it works:
And on macOS, it does not:
I know that this is a edge case, and according to here, it should be fixed when the pyarrow team releases a working macOS wheel of the 0.9.0 version. However pip can correctly identify and install each OS specific version. So, I, personally, think this should work on pipenv too.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
$ python -m pipenv.help (Linux):
$ python -m pipenv.help output
$ python -m pipenv.help (macOS):
Expected result
Pipenv should correctly install each OS specific version.
Actual result
Pipenv fails to install latest version of pyarrow under Linux
Steps to replicate
Install pyarrow under Linux with pipenv
