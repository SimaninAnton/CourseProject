In a discussion about pip intentionally breaking external use of internal APIs in pip 10, continued from https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031683.html, this appeared:
From Paul Moore at https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031687.html:
We've had little or no feedback on the tracker from
people using more complex internals, so our working assumption has
been there's very little that can't be handled via the CLI or existing
packages. Feedback so far from this mail hints that maybe we were
wrong, but it's still hard to know if it's one or two key projects, or
a whole range of people that we've yet to hear from. I'm pretty sure,
for example, that pipenv uses internals, either directly or via one of
their dependencies, but we've not seen any feedback from them yet.
Wanted to make sure y'all knew.
