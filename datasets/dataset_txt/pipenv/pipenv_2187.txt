I have a watch command tracking my Pipfile but on every call of pipenv run the command is executed, even if the file wasn't changed. I tracked this down to the call of Project.touch_pipfile. I'm not sure if it required, for Pipfile to be touched every time, probably it is just a side effect of calling cli.py@ensure_project.
Would it be reasonable to only touch the Pipfile if it either doesn't exist or if there is actually a change to its contents?
