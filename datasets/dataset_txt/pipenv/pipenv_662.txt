I'm certainly missing something here but how is that possible to easily execute scripts installed by packages.
If I'm doing pipenv run python <some_script>, the script is expected to be in the local folder.
To be more concrete, if I'm installing peewee, pipenv install peewee, how would I run pwiz.py script that was installed.
Thanks
