I was trying to run pipenv in a Dockerfile and in order to install the deps globally I use this code:
ADD Pipfile /src/Pipfile
ADD Pipfile.lock /src/Pipfile.lock
RUN pipenv lock --requirements --no-hashes > /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt
since I'm developing on a mac the hashes will be different, so I'm using the --no-hashes option.
Unfortunately this still outputs the hashes when using --requirements.
Is this the intended behaviour? If so how I can properly use pipenv in a Dockerfile? I don't really need a virtualenv in this case
