On Windows, versions of Pipenv > 2018.10.13 attempt to connect to https://pypi.org during virtualenv creation, even if --pypi-mirror is specified. This is a regression from 2018.10.13.
I've compared the network activity of 2018.10.13 and 11.14/11.26. For the latter two, connection attempts to pypi.org are made regardless of whether --pypi-mirror is specified. With 10.13, no such attempts are made.
This issue causes inconsistent timeouts and failures when a user is behind a firewall with a drop rule affecting pypi.org.
