I have a simple little project with three dependencies: Flask, Flask-Cors and requests. My Pipfile lists the version for each as "*", since I want to stay up to date and just use the newest version anyway.
When I run pipenv install, I get the following error:
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Flask 
(from -r /tmp/requirements.txt (line 3)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for Flask (from -r /tmp/requirements.txt (line 3))
along with the suggestion to use --ignore-hashes to get around this.
However, using the option gives the exact same behavior.
This happens on Ubuntu 16.10, Xubuntu 16.04, and Manjaro Linux.
