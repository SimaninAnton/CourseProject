I defined PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 and the virtualenv was well created in the project as .venv.
When executing pipenv --rm, it doesn't find/delete the virtualenv created in the project.
Warning message: "No virtualenv has been created for this project yet! Aborted!"
Expected result: It should delete the .venv folder in the project folder.
Pipenv version: '2018.11.26'
Pipenv–specific environment variables:
PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT: 1
