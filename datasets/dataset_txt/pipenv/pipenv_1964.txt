I assume this is a known issue since the message suggests it's a bug but installing click showed up the error message (copied below). Running it a second time said it was already installed and completed successfully.
This isn't really an issue for me but I thought I'd dump the stacktrace here on the off chance it's any use to you.
Thanks for pipenv in general. It's an incredibly useful tool.
