I would really like to know that does --fancy do behind the scene so that user could understand when or who should invoke it.
As the current documentation explains nothing for the usage:
--fancy
Run in shell in fancy mode (for elegantly configured shells).
What does fancy mode really mean? Is this somewhat common phrase that I missed?
What is an elegantly configured shell with respect to bash, zsh, fish, etc.?
