Issue description
I think this is new since I just updated fish shell and it was the first thing I noticed that was broken. The $PATH upon using pipenv shell seems to put previous $PATH then virtualenv path then $PATH again, but I am not entirely sure. I believe it used to be work fine out of the box with just prepending the virtualenv PATH to my $PATH but after my fish_user_path (which also was not preferable)
Expected result
Have pipenv prepend virtualenv to path in fish shell
Actual result
Has virtualenv python path in between two copies of $PATH for some reason
Steps to replicate
Update to fish 3.0
Other:
Yeah I rolled back fish to 2.7.1 (if anyone has this issue, try brew switch fish 2.7.1) and seems to work. Think its specific to pipenv prepending to path. Also have issues with pipenv prepending to $PATH after $PATH but before the $fish_user_paths stuff so maybe could be done as one fix?
