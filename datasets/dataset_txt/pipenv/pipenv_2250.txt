I am unable do activate virtualenv using pipenv shell with python managed by pyenv.
Here is the output of my terminal:
roger@ohm:/tmp/lab $ pipenv --venv
No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!
roger@ohm:/tmp/lab $ pipenv install requests

roger@ohm:/tmp/lab $ pipenv shell
ERROR: The virtualenv hasn't been activated correctly.
Either the env is corrupted (try running `pew restore env`),
Or an upgrade of your Python version broke your env,
Or check the contents of your $PATH. You might be adding new directories to it
from inside your shell's configuration file.
In this case, for further details please see: https://github.com/berdario/pew#the-environment-doesnt-seem-to-be-activated
I followed the steps of the URL above, changing PATH order, but no sucess.
