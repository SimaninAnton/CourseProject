which_pip() seems to only return a single string but str.format seems to be expecting two separate positional arguments.
>>> '{0} {1}'.format('oops!')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: tuple index out of range
I am guessing that windows is supposed to be that second argument and if that is the case, the closing bracket should simply be moved to include it.
# old
c = delegator.run('"{0}" install {1} pip --upgrade'.format(which_pip()), windows, block=False) 

# new?
c = delegator.run('"{0}" install {1} pip --upgrade'.format(which_pip(), windows), block=False) 
I wasn't 100% sure that this was the correct solution though but if it is, I could also send a PR to fix it.
Thanks!
