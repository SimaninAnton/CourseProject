Some packages like Jinja2 have multiple valid ways to write them. Depending on what you do, they flip-flop between them.
Describe your environment
OS Type macOS
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 9.0.1 and current master
Expected result
Package names in Pipfile stay constant.
Actual result
When installing Jinja2 becomes lowercase, when uninstalling any other package, it becomes uppercase.
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv install --verbose jinja2
Gives you:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[packages]

"jinja2" = "*"


[dev-packages]
$ pipenv install --verbose pytest
gives you (as expected):
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[packages]

"jinja2" = "*"
pytest = "*"


[dev-packages]
Now, if you run
$ pipenv uninstall --verbose pytest
You get a stack trace, which I will report in a different ticket. :)
But
$ pipenv uninstall --verbose pytest
now gives you:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[packages]

"Jinja2" = "*"


[dev-packages]
Notice the capital “J”. As you can imagine, that’s rather annoying when checking in changes. :)
