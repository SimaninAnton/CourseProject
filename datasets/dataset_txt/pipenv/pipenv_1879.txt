(Hope it's OK to file a feature request here, didn't see any explicit documentation regarding that.)
tl;dr: I'd like to use pipenv to generate a bundle suitable for AWS Lambda
For reference, here is the AWS Lambda documentation for how to create a bundle with pip:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html#deployment-pkg-for-virtualenv
There are a couple existing pipenv issues that touch on this use case:
#163
#746
But neither of those directly requests this feature, so I figured it might be helpful to do so.
