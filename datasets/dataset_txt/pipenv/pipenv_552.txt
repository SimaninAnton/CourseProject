What is the recommended workflow for an editable system-wide installation of a package using pipenv in a docker container? #2585 somewhat alluded to this, but never quite answered it. I take it it would be:
pipenv install --system --dev
pip install -e .
As the error message from trying pipenv install --system --dev -e . makes it clear that system-wide installs of packages are not supported and installing dependencies specified in the Pipfile are the only option supported by the command. Is there a better way to do this then the above?
$ pipenv --support
