It seems that Platform version is parsed incorrectly and includes the current date and time on Ubuntu at the very least.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 17.10
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
Platform version should be "Ubuntu".
Actual result
Pipfile.lock contains the following:
{
  // ...
  "platform_version": "#34-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 19 16:34:46 UTC 2018",
  // ...
}
Steps to replicate
Create a pipfile on Ubuntu and install it, creating the lock.
