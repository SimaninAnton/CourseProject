When specifiying --three / --two I would expect that it creates a Pipfile that enforces Python 3 / 2.
But in fact it enforces the concrete Python version installed on my computer.
Wouldn't it be clearer if the existing option --python <version> is used for that purpose while --three/--two is only used for specifing that Python 3 / 2 is enforced (without a specific version) or at least that my version is enforced at minimum?
Then I could use --python 3.6 to enforce python 3.6, while I would use --three to enforce any python 3 environment (or any python 3 greater equal 3.6, if 3.6 is my local installation).
Or did I miss the real intention of the --two / --three / --python parameters?
