I have python 3.6 environment and using us package
I'm using us==1.0.0:
which supports python 3.6 (looks good so far)
but depends on jellyfish==0.5.6 (not py3.6?)
pipenv installs jellyfish==0.6.1 which supports py3.6
So we end up with:
jellyfish=0.6.1
us=1.0.0 which requires 0.5.6
pipenv raises error about version conflicts
Could not find a version that matches jellyfish==0.5.6,==0.6.1
I'm wondering if dependency resolution works correctly?
If works ok what's the solution for such case?
Shouldn't be jellyfish==0.5.6 treated as py3.6 compatible?
