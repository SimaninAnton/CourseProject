I've noticed that when I do a pipenv sync, it causes all the packages in my Pipfile.lock to be downloaded again from my package source (e.g., PyPi or Artifactory).
I'd like to see pipenv sync rely on the PIPENV_CACHE_DIR.
Am I missing something or is there another command I should be using to install the .lock dependencies from PIPENV_CACHE_DIR? I currently use pipenv sync for CI and it's causing a lot of unnecessary data transfer.
