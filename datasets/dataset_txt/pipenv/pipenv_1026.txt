Currently there are two practices of making virtual environment folder. One to is create a environment folder venv under the project tree and install package inside venv. Another is to install package under $HOME/.local tree. How about creating two folders, under two different places, by making a soft link automatically, like ln -s. I do not have to worry about which practice I should follow. There are always two folders, pointing to the same package tree, without any extra space. Is it a good practice? Thank you.
