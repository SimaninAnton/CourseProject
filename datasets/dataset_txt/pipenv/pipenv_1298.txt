In my ~/.virtualenvs folder, I have a number of environments - some are managed by pew and others by pipenv. I can't easily tell which is which (although my guess is that the ones ending in -<random letters> are managed by pipenv), nor do I appear to be able to identify which project directory is associated with the pipenv-managed venvs.
Basically, I'm looking for a way to do housekeeping on old or experimental projects - identify and tidy up no longer used virtual environments, determine whether it's OK to delete a project directory or if it will leave a venv behind, etc. My ~ directory is on a limited-space SSD, so I'd prefer to keep it clean.
