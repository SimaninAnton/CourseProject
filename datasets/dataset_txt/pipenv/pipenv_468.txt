Issue description
I'm on mac trying to switch a project over to pipenv, it requires an older version of wxpython (2.8.12.1)
When running it says it needs to be run with pythonw instead of python but it doesn't appear that pipenv copies / creates pythonw binary in the
$ which python
/Users/paul/.local/share/virtualenvs/python-Uwh_RfUa/bin/python
$ which pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/pythonw
Expected result
run pythonw through pipenv
Actual result
$ python main.py 
This program needs access to the screen.
Please run with 'pythonw', not 'python', and only when you are logged
in on the main display of your Mac.

$ ls $(dirname `which python`)/pythonw
ls: /Users/paul/.local/share/virtualenvs/python-Uwh_RfUa/bin/pythonw: No such file or directory
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
$ pipenv --support
