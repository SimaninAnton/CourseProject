The install instructions on the main pipenv page specify a non-user install of pip [1] while the separate installation docs [2] specify a user install, is the difference intentional, or should a --user install always be recommended?
Its likely on some platforms (e.g. most Linux variants) that attempts to install without --user will present the user with a Permission denied traceback.
Sorry if this is noise, but I didn't see an alternate forum for asking a question before opening an issue (I also didn't find an identical issue with a quick issue search).
