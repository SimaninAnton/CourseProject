I'd like to be able to generate wheels for all dependencies in a Pipfile.lock while taking advantage of hash verification. Prior to 11.1.2 you could accomplish this with:
pipenv lock -r > reqs.txt
pip wheel -r reqs.txt
(#1417 was problematic for this workflow, but otherwise it worked)
In 11.1.2, hashes were removed from the requirements-style output which (afaik) means there is no way to build/download hash-verified wheels from a lock file.
The use-case is to package Python modules for offline installs or installs without compilation/development tools on the server. The wheels can be built, then distributed and installed in a minimal Python environment.
Is this functionality that you'd consider including in the project? If not, is there some way to support this workflow again?
