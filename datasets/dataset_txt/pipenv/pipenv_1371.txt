As per #628 and #630, some output, e.g. courtesy notices and messages like
Loading .env environment variablesâ€¦
are sent to stderr instead of stdout. This is somewhat unexpected behaviour as these are clearly not error messages. In fact, these messages are polluting some of our error logs. It would be really useful to have an option to completely suppress these messages, e.g. by allowing the --bare flag for the run and shell commands.
