Hey there!
I've been browsing through this project and I gotta say I actually really admire what you guys have been doing, however, one thing that really intrigues me is the fact that you guys used the GPL "slogan" (free as in freedom) to describe it, when it isn't in fact a free (as in freedom) project, since it is under the MIT license.
Anyway, it was just something that was really bugging me out and I could not find anything similar on any recent issue (opened and closed).
