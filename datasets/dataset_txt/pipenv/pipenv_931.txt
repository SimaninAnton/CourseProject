Running with both the latest release and the latest master of pipenv, selective upgrades don't appear to work as expected. (If I'm doing something wrong, please let me know :-) )
$ python -m pipenv.help output
```
Expected result
If I run pipenv install --selective-upgrade requests, I expect the lockfile to be updated to requests==2.19.1 and the new version to be installed in the virtualenv.
Actual result
The lockfile is not updated and the new version of requests is not installed.
Steps to replicate
Clone https://github.com/mark-adams/pipenv-selective-upgrade-test
Run pipenv install
Run pipenv install --selective-upgrade requests
