Issue description
When we run pipenv shell, we end up being in the Pipfile's directory even if we ran the command in a sub-directory.
Expected result
I expect to stay in the directory I ran the command in.
Actual result
We are moved into the Pipfile's directory.
Steps to replicate
$ pwd
/home/simudyne/Documents/lebaron-models/fw12_dca
$ ls ..
... Pipfile ...
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environmentâ€¦
$ pwd
/home/simudyne/Documents/lebaron-models
$ pipenv --support
