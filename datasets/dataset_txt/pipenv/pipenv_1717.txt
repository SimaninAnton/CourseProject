Describe your environment
Ubuntu 17.04, Python 3.5.3, pipenv 9.0.1
Expected result
pipenv lock -r returns the exact same output when given the same Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.
Actual result
pipenv lock -r randomly reorders lines on each run. This becomes a problem when combined with pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt and version control, as it chances requirements.txt even if there is no actual change.
Steps to replicate
Create a project with Pipfile and Pipfile.lock (mine for reference). Run pipenv lock -r.
Workaound
A possible workaround is pipenv lock -r | sort.
