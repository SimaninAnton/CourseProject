Trying to create a pipenv in the root directory (cd /; pipenv --two) results in an error:
Creating a Pipfile for this project...
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
usage: pew [-h] [-p PYTHON] [-i PACKAGES] [-r REQUIREMENTS] [-d] [-a PROJECT]
           envname
pew: error: too few arguments
The problem is probably around this line: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/blob/0156f1e1b397cd8fcfe23738f49cf0bf6067ec76/pipenv/project.py#L33
