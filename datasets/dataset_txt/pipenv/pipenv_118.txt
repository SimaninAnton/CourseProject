I am using PyCharm for development and have run into issues with their integration of pipenv when using a pyenv-installed interpreter. As a result, I am using the virtualenv created by pipenv directly as well as specifying my interpreter directly in order to install packages when I am operating within PyCharm.
If I install packages this way, they go into the virtualenv's site-packages directory, but they do not update my Pipfile or Pipfile.lock. This makes sense, since it is bypassing the use of pipenv to install these packages.
However, is there a way to sync the existing packages within my virtualenv to my Pipfile.lock? Ideally, I could also sync my Pipfile, although I could see that being more complicated without having the exact command used to install these packages available (updating Pipfile manually is manageable in my case).
