I haven't looked into what's happening with matplotlib 2.1.0, but trying to install it with pipenv fails with:
pip.exceptions.InstallationError: Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /var/folders/0l/c9dt_3f11ks8_r84qtrjj0k00000gn/T/tmp7qdfg9tlbuild/subprocess32/
My system is pretty clean. pipenv is installed by pipsi and is up-to-date.
$ pip3 list
pip (9.0.1)
setuptools (36.5.0)
virtualenv (15.1.0)
wheel (0.30.0)
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.2.6
Here's how to reproduce.
mkdir dummy
cd dummy

# this fails
pipenv install "matplotlib==2.1.0"

# this works
pipenv install "matplotlib==2.1.0rc1"
Thanks!
