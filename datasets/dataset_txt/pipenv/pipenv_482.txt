Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Pipenv dependency resolution is slow. While some of it is due to the recursive nature of discovering and invalidating dependencies, some it is is slow due to how Pipenv downloads packages and executes them to determine the dependencies. Pypi supports json endpoints that will deliver dependencies without the need to download/execute (though I don't believe it works for every package)
Describe the solution you'd like
Pipenv appears to explicitly disable the newer api and use the legacy download/execute method, regardless of what the repo supports. (See pipenv/utils.py where it constructs PyPIRepository with use_json=False).
While this doesn't change the complexity of the algorithm, allowing use of the json api would greatly speed up the scalar factor.
Describe alternatives you've considered
I'm mostly just looking for an update on your thinking about how dependencies are found and whether or not usage of the json api is on the horizon.
