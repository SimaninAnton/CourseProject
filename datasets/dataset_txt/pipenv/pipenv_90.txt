$ pipenv --support
my env is..
host os : ubuntu 16.04 / 8 cpu, 7gb ram, 100gb ssd
guest os : docker container / ubuntu 16.04 / 6 cpu, 6gb ram
guest os : virtualenv python3.7 and 3.6
problem is...
fbprophet does works fine when using python 3.6 virtualenv.
fbprophet doesn't work(hangs when install over 30 min) when using python 3.7 virtualenv
above htop is host os (which works fine)
below htop is guest os (which doesn't work, Uptime is stopped)
