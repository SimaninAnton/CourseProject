Hi!
I am currently using the Fabric to configure the continuous deploy.
However, there is a problem because can not control the new shell created by "pipenv shell".
Below is the deployment scenario script I tried.
$ pipenv shell pipenv install && exit
How do I install the package and auto exit the spawned shell?
Thank you!
