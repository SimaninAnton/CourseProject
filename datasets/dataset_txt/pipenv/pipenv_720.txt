Issue description
Locking(pipenv lock --verbose) fails with
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pipenv/patched/piptools/repositories/pypi.py", line 301, in get_legacy_dependencies
    wheel_cache=self.wheel_cache,
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'download_dir'
I expect this is related to #2329, though I don't think it's the same situation(I don't have a setup.py).
Expected result
locking should succeed
Actual result
$ pipenv lock --verbose
Steps to replicate
pipenv install or pipenv lock
$ pipenv --support
