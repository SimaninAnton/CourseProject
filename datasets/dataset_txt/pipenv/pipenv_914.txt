Since 2018.6.25, pipenv install --dev -e . gets resolved to absolute paths when running pipenv lock --requirements --dev >dev-requirements.txt.
That has the downside, that that .txt is only usable by the person who locked the dependencies if you (like us and I’m sure many more) use Pipenv to manage your deps, but use standard .txt files to deploy/tox.
I’m sure you had good reasons to change this behavior but it would be great to have an option to get the old back.
