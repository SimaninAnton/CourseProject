Add an NPM like version command for the pipenv cli that modifies the package's version according to the semver part
Here is a working gist: https://gist.github.com/iddan/22bbb835f7a862a314f995f5d66674eb
To integrate it the function should be registered in the cli.py and be tested.
Should I PR this? Is this a welcome feature?
