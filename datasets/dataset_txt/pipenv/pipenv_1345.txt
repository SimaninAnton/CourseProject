In a brand new environment Im trying to install django = "==1.8.19" and django-redis = "==4.4.4".
However, Pipenv warns a conflict:
Could not find a version that matches django==1.8.19,>=1.11.
The thing is: django-redis at version 4.4.4 has no dependency on Django, as we can see here: https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis/blob/4.0.0/setup.py#L19
On the other hand, django-redis at the current release (4.9.0) and on master has a dependency on Django 1.11, as we can see here: https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis/blob/4.9.0/setup.py#L24
I think Pipenv is "looking" at the wrong versions, or is getting the wrong information, when trying to create the lock file.
Using version 11.7.4
Expected result
Pipenv should allow me to install Django at version 1.8.19 and Django-redis at version 4.4.4
Actual result
Pipenv says there is a conflict on Django versions, even though django-redis at version 4.4.4 has no dependency on Django.
Steps to replicate
In a brand new directory:
pipenv install django==1.8.19
pipenv install django-redis==4.4.4
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Pipenv version: `'11.7.4'`
