I'd like to run some commands within a new shell to further set up the environment. Two specific examples:
execute the argparse autocompleter for some scripts within the environment
set a Mac environment variable which causes exceptions when forking processes
I can't seem to find a way to run a specific command(s) after shell is spawned. This should be part of the Pipfile
A not-nearly-as-good option would be to have a specific section of my .bashrc which runs commands per environment, but that's a bit hacky, and it looks like the best variable to use would be the VIRTUAL_ENV, which points to the unique hidden environment directory.
Any other ways to solve this?
