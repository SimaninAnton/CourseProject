We distribute a script which in turn uses pipenv to run some python code. We do this to be able to have our script be portable.
What we are looking for is a way to check/verify that the machine the script is running on has the latest version of the pipfile.lock file.
Workaround is to always run pipenv install which works the way we want IF the pipefile.lock is missing or invalid. But it doesn't when everything is OK. Meaning, what happens then is that it uninstalls/removes everything and reinstalls. The option, if present, would simply do nothing at this point.
I hope that makes sense?
