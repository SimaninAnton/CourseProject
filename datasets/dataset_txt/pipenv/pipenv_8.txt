I have a Pipfile & Pipfile.lock which only have one package(openpyxl) and its already locked via pipenv lock. When I uninstall the openpyxl, my Pipfile.lock also changed (the openpyxl and its sub dependencies vanished) even tho I had locked the Pipfile.lock. if the .lock file changes in this way then what is the use of pipenv lock and why this is happening ? Can someone please explain how Pipfile.lock works ?
