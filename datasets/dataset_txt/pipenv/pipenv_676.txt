Not sure if this is intended behaviour or not. But sync doesn't sync the virtualenv to the pipfile but instead 'Installs all packages specified in Pipfile.lock.' (and will leave any installed packages in the virtualenv if these are not specified in pipfile.lock).
If it's as intended it's worth clarifying this is the docs. Happy to submit a PR if this is helpful.
