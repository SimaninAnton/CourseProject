pipenv includes an option named --venv which outputs virtualenv information:
$ pipenv --venv
/home/example/.local/share/virtualenvs/bla-534BN
This is a confusingly named command-line option. pipenv does not use venv at all, it uses virtualenv, and yet this command-line option is named after venv, not virtualenv. Both venv and virtualenv play similar roles, and so it's confusing to get one named for the other.
I propose deprecating --venv, and introducing a better named flag, maybe --virtualenv or --env-dir.
