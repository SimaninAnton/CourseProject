Previously I could reference git repos via the pipfile, even though they were not supported on the command line. Now running pipenv install with the latest version gives the following error:
For --editable= git+git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git@<hash>#egg=<pkgname> only git+URL, hg+URL, svn+URL, bzr+URL is currently supported
