I'm using pipenv for a new project in the hopes that it'll help simplify the on-boarding process for new devs. Already it's much better than teaching people how to use virtualenv. Ideally, I'd like new contributors to be able to simply clone the repo, then run e.g. pipenv run app.py to run the code locally.
The biggest blocker of that right now is that you have to manually run pipenv install once before you can do pipenv run python app.py. I think pipenv should automatically install all dependencies when creating a new environment if there's already a Pipfile present. This would allow you to run pipenv run python app.py immediately after cloning a project and it'll "just work".
If the maintainers of pipenv agree that this feature is desirable, I'd be happy to submit a PR adding the functionality.
