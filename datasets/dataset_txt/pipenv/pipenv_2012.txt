Hi,
First just want to say thanks for pipenv! It's a fantastic tool.
I have noticed an issue when pipenv gets one of my private packages from github. I have an ssh key with a passphrase. In this example, I update 3 packages off github with pipenv update and it will ask for my passphrase 3 times immediately. If I type my password 3 times, the first password is hidden, the next two display on subsequent lines in clear text and the updates work fine:
However, if I just type in the password once and fail the next two passwords by pressing enter 2 more times, everything seems to work as it should when pipenv installs the initially failed dependencies. It asks for passphrases one at a time:
This is Ubuntu 17.04.
Hope this helps and thanks again for pipenv!
