In my project, I have four libraries where I have local patches. I have built wheels for all four, and then
run pipenv install <path to local wheel> for each.
This results in a Pipfile that correctly refers to the local wheels for all four.
However, the Pipfile.lock refers to the local wheel for two of them, but not for the other two.
This leads to a clean pipenv install installing the packages from pypi instead.
This is the pipenv.help output with all four of these libraries installed.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
And here is a more minimal case, with just one of the problematic wheels installed:
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Pipfile.lock should refer to the local wheel for all four of the installed libraries, not just two of them.
Actual result
Two of the four libraries are not specified as paths to local wheels in the Pipfile.lock.
Steps to replicate
Extract wheels.zip, which contains the wheels in question.
pipenv install ./wheels/GoogleAppEnginePipeline-1.9.22.1-py2-none-any.whl
Optionally, install the other 3 wheels for comparison, but installing this one wheel is enough to see the problem.
