Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv.
Check the diagnose documentation for common issues before posting! We may close your issue if it is very similar to one of them. Please be considerate, or be on your way.
Make sure to mention your debugging experience if the documented solution failed.
Issue description
In the documentation here for the package lock command it has a flag specified -d --dev with the text
"Install both develop and default packages." When I execute the following command:
pipenv lock -r --dev 
It outputs only dev dependencies. Either it is working incorrectly or the documentation is confusing to me.
https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Expected result
I would expect it to output all dependencies in the Pipfile.
Actual result
Only dev dependencies are output.
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
