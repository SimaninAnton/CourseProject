I have upgraded pipenv to 8.2.5. Now, I am trying to install envparse. And I have faced this issue:
pipenv install envparse fails
pipenv uninstall envparse fails with the same error
pipenv lock fails with the same error (this package was removed already)
As I can see this, package resolution is broken for some reason.
Output
» pipenv install envparse 
Did you mean parse? [Y/n]: n
