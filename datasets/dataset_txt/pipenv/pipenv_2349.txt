Hello,
Right now pipenv install installs the vritualenv environment to the directory $HOME/.local/share/virtualenvs.
I want to specify the the directory path with command line option.
$ pipenv install
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
...
Virtualenv location: /home/jaruga/.local/share/virtualenvs/pipenv-E-4hsA7t
...
It is like this.
$ pipenv install --path vendor/venv
I think that setting the path is a typical workflow for Ruby's same kind of tool Bundler (the command is bundle) [1].
So, I want the feature for pipenv too.
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle 
How do you think?
By the way, I am really happy to find pipenv today.
I knew this kind of the tool to create clean environment for Ruby's Bundler, Perl's Carton, PHP's Composer. However I did not know it for Python.
Thank you for pipenv.
