Running /usr/local/bin/pipenv --venv without actually exporting the correct PATH variable produces inconclusive and misleading message: "No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!"
This snippet
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
echo $(/usr/local/bin/pipenv --venv)
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/root/bin:$PATH
echo $(/usr/local/bin/pipenv --venv)
would produce following
No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!

/.local/share/virtualenvs/myapp-dU9nX2_T
Describe your environment
FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE-p4
Python 3.6.4
pipenv, version 10.1.2
Expected result
Somewhat more conclusive message. For example:
Warning: it looks like XYZ is not in your PATH. We cannot continue until this is resolved.
Actual result
The inconclusive message:
No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!
Steps to replicate
Please see the snippet above.
