when converting my old project to Pipenv I've got an exception:
RuntimeError: No stable configuration of concrete packages could be found for the given constraints after 16 rounds of resolving.
This is likely a bug.
Unfortunately it did not say which package is problematic (even with --verbose option) - adding some hints here may be an help.
But going one dependency by one, I've found that removing line:
Pillow = "*"
resolves an issue, so I changed it to:
pillow = "*"
and that resolved an issue.
IMHO there is a problem when earlier package is generating dependency with different letter case (in this example pillow instead Pillow) - so most probably there is an issue with ignoring case of the packages.
