on Ubuntu 16.04 - default system python is 3.5; my PATH default python is python 3.6;
$ pip shell
in a new directory will install python-2.7: neither the system's default python installation, nor the default for python in my path.
This is contrary to the end of this documentation section:
https://docs.pipenv.org/basics.html?highlight=default%20python#specifying-versions-of-python
Note: /usr/bin/python is linked to /usr/bin/python2.7 but that is preceded in my path by /usr/local/bin/python (linked to /usr/local/bin/python3.6).
