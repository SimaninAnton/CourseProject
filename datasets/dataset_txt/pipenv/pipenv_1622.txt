We have different pip mirror urls (both public and private) depending on environments. Our private mirror is password protected. It would be nice to be able to provide global source configuration, without having to commit urls into all of the repositories, and also avoid having to store passwords in the repo (or enter them every time you are updating dependencies).
Pip does that via .pip/pip.conf file, where you can have [global] section with your per-environment configuration which makes work that Ops have to do a lot easier.
This also would be useful in environments where one wants to prevent global pypi from being used (to avoid depending on resources external to the datacenter in the build process), without modifying code being built/installed.
