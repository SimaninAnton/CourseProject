Hi,
I am very new to this so please excuse if it is a dumb question. I will appreciate any help/pointers in this regards.
Example:
AppA uses AppB
I used pipenv install to install AppA and AppB separately in separate folders / virtual environments.
I can do pipenv run python AppB
I can also do pipenv run python AppA but I get the error as AppA cannot access the dependency on AppB.
Question:
Is there a way to make AppA access AppB's virtual environment & the application from within AppA's virtual environment?
