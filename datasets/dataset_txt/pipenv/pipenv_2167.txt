I tried to put this in my Pipfile:
[requires]
python_version = "3.6.2"
And got:
Warning: Python 3.6.2 was not found on your systemâ€¦
You can specify specific versions of Python with:
  $ pipenv --python path/to/python
$ pyenv versions
  system
* 2.7.13 (set by /Users/johria/.pyenv/version)
  3.5.3
* 3.6.0 (set by /Users/johria/.pyenv/version)
  3.6.1
As you can see, I don't have 3.6.2 installed.
