Hi guys, I'm trying to get this readme to make sense, but when I follow the instructions I can't seem to get my stuff running. I'm trying to make the instructions as easy as npm. https://github.com/savovs/flask-graphene-hello
I get two errors when I follow the readme in the above repo:
Could not find a version that matches graphene>=2.0.dev
zsh: command not found: flask
It works when I manually install dependencies like this:
$ pipenv install flask flask-graphql graphene = ">=2.0.dev"
Any ideas about what I'm doing wrong?
