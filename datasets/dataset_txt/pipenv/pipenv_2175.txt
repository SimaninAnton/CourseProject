Hi, I would like to know what do u think about updating the version convention like this:
Old New Why
==3.2 3.2 is == necessary? Why?
'*' latest Would this be feasible? or does '*' means something different? Could we use a literal instead, more expressive?
Examples:
Old
django = '==3.2'
mock = "*"
New
django = 3.2
mock = latest
This is parsed like this by contoml:
{source = {'django': 3.2, 'mock': 'latest'}}
Keeping >= and any other it's okay, maybe something similar to npm would be cool to introduce.
Thanks!!
