Hi,
My Problem
When I run the pipenv shell command, the shell works whell but I have this error: bash: __git_ps1: command not found.
Context
I work on MacOS and I use git-prompt to see informations on the current repository in my prompt, like this: repo_name (master *). ls -l (where repo_name (master *). is my prompt and ls -l is a command for the example).
This git-prompt is activated in my ~/.bash_profile like this:
PS1='\[\e[1;34m\]\W\[\e[0m\]$(__git_ps1)\[\e[1;34m\].\[\e[0m\] '

[...]

# Bash Completion
if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
    source /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash
    source /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh
fi
[ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
Does somebody have an idea to fix that ?
Tanks a lot ! :)
