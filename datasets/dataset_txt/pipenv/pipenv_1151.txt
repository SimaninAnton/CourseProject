We're looking into vendoring pipenv to help with managing environments in the Firefox build systems, and to assist with upgrading from Python 2.7 to Python 3.5+
According to the dependencies, requests[security] and ordereddict are required for Python versions below 3.0:
pipenv/setup.py
Lines 31 to 32 in 9ecaf85
 'requests[security];python_version<"3.0"', 
 'ordereddict;python_version<"3.0"', 
This means we also need to vendor these packages and their dependencies, which is causing us some additional challenges. When looking to see if I could exclude these dependencies, I found that they were recently only necessary for Python 2.6:
pipenv/setup.py
Lines 32 to 34 in 861429e
 if sys.version_info < (2, 7): 
     required.append('requests[security]') 
     required.append('ordereddict') 
This was changed in 56d52b0#diff-2eeaed663bd0d25b7e608891384b7298 without any suggestion for why the version requirement should be raised. This leads me to suspect this was an error, and I have been able to successfully vendor and use pipenv with the clause changed to <"2.7".
I'll submit a pull request with this change.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
requests[security] and ordereddict are not required on Python 2.7.
Actual result
These dependencies are required.
Steps to replicate
Install pipenv under Python 2.7.
