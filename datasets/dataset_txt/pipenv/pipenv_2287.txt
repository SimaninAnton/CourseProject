I just started playing around with this project, and was surprised that pipenv --three in ~/Code/test-pipenv resulted in a virtualenv named test-pipenv-7v2SBB6d. Diving into the code, I eventually found that this was added in PR #238. I skimmed through that, and the related issue, and I think I understand the reasoning behind it. However, I couldn't find documentation for that behavior, and I imagine that others might also find it surprising (if not irritating).
