I'm trying to install tox plugin with pipenv in my project. I suppose that's was broken after this commit 50be8c3 and easiest way to fix that issue revert changes. Also, I have tried to revert that commit but pipenv start failed with another bug like project.pipfile_sources project does not have attribute pipfile_sources in the same file.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Module successfuly installed in virtual environment.
Actual result
$ pipenv install tox-pipenv
Pipfile.lock (e17f05) out of date, updating to (5fc513)...
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies...
penv/resolver.py", line 37, in main
    from pipenv.utils import create_mirror_source, resolve_deps, replace_pypi_sources
ImportError: cannot import name 'create_mirror_source'
