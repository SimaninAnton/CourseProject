Hi,
I would like to support multiple python_version (more exactly, I want to support python 3.5 and 3.6, but there is a problem with python 3.5.2 on a sub dependency, so I would like the support >3.5.2) and I can't find the right way to define this.
In the documentation it says Pipenv automatically honors both the python_full_version and python_version PEP 508 specifiers. but I don't seems to be able to express it:
in my pipenv I put:
[requires]
python_full_version = ">3.5.2"
> pipenv install
Warning: Your Pipfile requires python_version >3.5.2, but you are using 3.5.3 (/home/a/.local/share/v/a/bin/python)
I see that request does not define the required python version, it seems to be done in travis. Is it the right way to do this ?
