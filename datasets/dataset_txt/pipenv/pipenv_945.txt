I am attempting to install in a Docker container, and I was getting this error:
Step 6/10 : RUN pipenv install --system --deploy
Warning: --system is intended to be used for pre-existing Pipfile installation, not installation of specific packages. Aborting.
The command '/bin/sh -c pipenv install --system --deploy' returned a non-zero code: 1
The error message make think there was an issue with my Pipfile.lock. I rebuilt the lock file, and it did not help.
I was able to resolve the issue by changing my user to root and not attempting to do it in the root directoyr.
Please run $ python -m k.help, and paste the results here.
If you're on MacOS, just run the following:
$ python -m pipenv.help | pbcopy
Expected result
I expected an error message to tell me that I did not have permissions or something to that effect.
I'd be happy to work on a pull request to help with this, if it is something that would be useful.
