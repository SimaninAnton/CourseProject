# Pipfile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
dj-paypal = "0.7.0"
"1793fa7" = {file = "https://github.com/jleclanche/dj-stripe/archive/master.tar.gz"}
This pipfile depends on two packages:
dj-stripe, pulled from git master tarball (https://github.com/jleclanche/dj-stripe/archive/master.tar.gz)
dj-paypal, which itself depends on dj-stripe
The resulting environment is corrupt however: dj-stripe will be installed twice, in mismatching ways.
pipenv should either resolve the file dependency first and understand that it is dj-stripe and satisfies the dj-paypal "dj-stripe" dependency, or at least warn/error rather than create a corrupt env.
Edit: dj-paypal 0.7.1 drops the dj-stripe dependency, so I've locked it at 0.7.0
