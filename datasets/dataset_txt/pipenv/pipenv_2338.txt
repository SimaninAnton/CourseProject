I just started using this tool, but the first thing that comes to mind: i immediately miss that my zsh can auto activate the virtualenv enymore. Why does the tool add a hash after the projects name even if there are no conflicts? my shell can load a vitualenv either with the same name or one that can be found in a .venv dir in the project root.
Automatically linking it there should not be that hard to do and saves everyone with a decent shell having to activate the virtualenv. Or is the tool doing anything special while activating the virtualenv with the shell command?
