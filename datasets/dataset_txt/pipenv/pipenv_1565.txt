16 is a suitable value for a typical modern laptop, but VMs are more likely to have 1 or 2 CPUs and memory in the single digits of GBs. If a few packages require gcc, this is pretty likely to result in them all running simultaneously and thrashing or OOMing.
It looks like this value has changed arbitrarily in the past. Would a pull request to make it os.cpu_count() + 1 (one process on each core, one stalled on I/O) be reasonable, possibly clamped to < 32? Obviously it's impossible to predict how much memory will be used, but CPU count seems like a decent proxy for beefiness.
