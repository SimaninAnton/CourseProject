While there a multiple related closed issues, I'm unclear about what the last stance on supporting --(extra-)index-url when importing from requirements.txt is. IMO, it's am important migration scenario to support these to help adoption of pipenv. Also, it should be pretty much straight forward to add. If -i or --index-url is present in requirements.txt, the default [[source]] URL of https://pypi.python.org/simple in Pipfile should be replaced with whatever is given as the index URL. If one or more --extra-index-url are present, there should be additional [[source]] URLs pointing at the given locations.
