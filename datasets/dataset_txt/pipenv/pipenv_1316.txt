The vendor folder contains a copy of pipfile.
But it looks like the pipfile repo is outdated, for example https://github.com/pypa/pipfile/blob/master/pipfile/api.py#L129-L141 doesn't appear in the vendor folder version.
This makes things difficult:
Any commit to vendor/pipfile needs to be mirrored in the other repository
Tests seem to reside in the pipenv repository, and not the pipfile repository
Is there any reason why we don't just reference pipfile as a dependency in pipenv?
