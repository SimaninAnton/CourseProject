When an environment variable source (possibly any source) is updated in the Pipfile, the new source isn't used for resolution when pipenv install or pipenv lock is next run.
See for example:
Pipfile
Pipfile.lock

Try updating the source in the Pipfile in the above to "https://pypi.python.org/${ENV_VAR}" and installation will still failing, complaining that https://pypi.python.org/${ENV_VAR} isn't reachable.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
