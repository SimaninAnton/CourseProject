Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Is it possible to use pipe/redirect in the scripts section of the Pipfile? e.g.:
 [scripts]
 generate-requirements = ""pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt"
I guess this might not be windows friendly...
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to be able to use pipes and redirects.
Describe alternatives you've considered
A workaround is to use bash -c:
 [scripts]
 generate-requirements = "bash -c \"pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\""
$ pipenv --support
