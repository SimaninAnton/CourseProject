I've used the practice of having dev-requirements.txt, requirements.txt, and prod-requirements in my work. While the former two can be replaced by Pipfile's [dev-packages] and [packages], but it seems I can't find any correspondents for Pipfile.
The usual purpose of prod-requirements.txt is, for example, installing packages related to AWS or raven to record server-side exceptions.
I want to sweepingly introduce Pipenv to my work, but the lack of [prod-packages] (or whatever we call it) prevent it from leave a single list of packages. I need to have both Pipenv and prod-requirements.txt which share the many common items, and also need to edit both files when I change dependencies. It's also hard to keep deployment scripts straightforward.
So I suggest Pipfile to have [prod-packages] list and pipenv install to have -p/--prod option. Do this suggestion make sense?
