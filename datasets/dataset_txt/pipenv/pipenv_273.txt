Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv.
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 2018.11.26
Probably related to #3136, however, I can't reopen that.
Issue description
pipenv doesn't find pyenv-python versions.
Expected result
When calling pipenv install pipenv should detect existing versions of Python installed by pyenv. If it doesn't find a Python version as specified in the Pipfile it should start installing the correct Python version via pyenv and then use it to create the virtual environment.
Actual result / Steps to replicate
$ pyenv versions
* system (set by /Users/$USER/.pyenv/version)
  3.5.5
  3.6.5
  3.6.8
$ env|grep PY
PYENV_ROOT=/Users/$USER/.pyenv
$ pipenv --python 3.6
Warning: Python 3.6 was not found on your system…
Would you like us to install CPython 3.6.8 with pyenv? [Y/n]:
Installing CPython 3.6.8 with pyenv (this may take a few minutes)…
✔ Success!

Warning: The Python you just installed is not available on your PATH, apparently.
