I am using zsh with oh-my-zsh as my main shell.
Everything worked fine, but today I have noticed this strange behavior:
» pipenv shell
Spawning environment shell (/usr/local/bin/zsh). Use 'exit' to leave.
[Oh My Zsh] Would you like to check for updates? [Y/n]: source /Users/sobolev/.virtualenvs/test_project-c7lHFdaF/bin/activate

» pipenv shell
Shell for UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT already activated.
No action taken to avoid nested environments.
So, what happened:
I tried to activate a existing pipenv shell
My oh-my-zsh script tried to check for updates
I had to close my terminal and reopen it to make everything work again
Describe your environment
OS Type: macos
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
zsh --version: zsh 5.3.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0)
Steps to replicate
I guess, it would be hard to replicate.
