Hi,
I use behave as the BDD framework for Python related projects and it usually ships with a binary which one can execute from the CLI.
Behave is usually a development dependency as it's not meant to live alongside the production code when this is then later packaged and shipped elsewhere.
Given it's a development dependency, I had it defined under the dev-packages section. By doing so though, I wasn't able to reach the behave binary file and so run it from the CLI.
I was able to do that when adding behave under the packages section though.
Is this behaviour expected?
Thank you.
