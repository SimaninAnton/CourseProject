Question
I have created a Django project with virtual environment created with pipenv.
Now I want to deploy this to heroku and as per heroku it required a requirements.txt file.
How can I generate the requirements.txt usingin pipenv.
I tried pipenv freeze > requirements.txt
I gives
Error: No such command "freeze".
