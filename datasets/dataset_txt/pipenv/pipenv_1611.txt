This may just be a documentation issue, but what's the recommended way of using console scripts provided by a package that has been installed into virtualenv managed by pipenv in a crontab?
With traditional virtualenvs, you'd just use the absolute path to bin/{whatever}, but with opaque virtualenvs I'm guessing there is or should be a different way.
