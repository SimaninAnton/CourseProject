Looks like pipenv run explicitly looks for items in venv's bin directory. Is there a way get it to run scripts that are in the current working directory in a performant manner?
For instance, a django project's manage.py file. The only way I could get it to work in that particular instance is pipenv run python manage.py which works but takes 2-3 times longer than just ./manage.py from inside the venv. I realize I could pipenv shell first which is pretty much what I did pre-pipenv, but I was just seeing if between pipenv and makefiles you could stop worrying about the venv altogether.
something like
init:
 pip install pipenv
 pipenv lock
 pipenv install --dev
 pipenv run ./manage.py migrate

serve:
 pipenv run ./manage.py runserver

test:
 pipenv run py.test -v
