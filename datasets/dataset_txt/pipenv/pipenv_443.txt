Issue description
We use pipenv to install five packages from local directories as 'editable' packages. In the most recent version of pipenv we see that when we do a pipenv install of those packages they report success and appear to succeed in the logs. However, we are unable to import them due to ModuleNotFoundError: No module named XXX.
Expected result
We are used to being able to install all five local editable packages, and then being able to import them in code that uses the virtualenv.
Actual result
Pipenv installs and reports exit code 0. However, importing modules gives a ModuleNotFoundError.
The logs report no errors, and verbose logs show the same actions being performed in the older and newer versions of pipenv.
Steps to replicate
Create a Pipfile that has 3 or more entries of the form:
"my_module" = {path = "./path/to/module", editable = true}
Then run pipenv install and try to import all those modules. You will likely get the import error.
Rather than paste the pipenv --support output, I've actually already got a fix and a test for it ready to go.
I spent enough time going down the rabbit hole today that I figured I'd take a pass at fixing it. I'll update the issue w/ the PR in a second.
