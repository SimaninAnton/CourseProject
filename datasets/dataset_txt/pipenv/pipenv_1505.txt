Originally I had export SHELL=zsh, and I experienced no shell-opening-related problems with any software. Then I got the error
pexpect.exceptions.ExceptionPexpect: The command was not found or was not executable: /path/to/my/project/zsh
when running pipenv shell. Of course this was fixed by changing my startup files to export SHELL=/usr/bin/zsh, but I find it odd that this is the first time this has caused a problem. ArchWiki does say that $SHELL should be "the path to your prefered shell", so I'm not arguing that pipenv has a bug per se, but that it should be more accommodating of people whose configuration is not perfect.
Describe your environment
Arch Linux
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 10.0.1
Expected result
pipenv shell should work.
Actual result
I get the error reproduced above.
Steps to replicate
$ export SHELL=bash # or whatever you have installed
$ pipenv --three
$ pipenv shell
Thanks!
