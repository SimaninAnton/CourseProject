I noticed the pipenv git repository takes a long time to clone because of it's size. This is because a number of wheels (binary data) is stored directly in the repo rather than using git LFS or other means.
The problem will only grow with time, when different versions of the wheels get committed, because the old ones will still be part of the repo and git cannot make smart diffs with binary data as it can with text.
Please find another solution to storing wheels for tests.
