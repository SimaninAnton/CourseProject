How about the feature for skipping some packages selectively, I mean something like this:
~ pipenv install --skip "mypy"
Why?
Some packages not incompatible with some implementations of Python (mypy does not work with PyPy for example) and it would be awesome to have feature for skipping such packages on installing.
For example on building on CI:
  - if [[ $TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION == "pypy3" ]]; then pipenv install --dev --skip "mypy"; fi
