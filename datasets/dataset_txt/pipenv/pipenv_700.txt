hi! Is there a way to create a requrirements.txt file without creating a virtualenv? I'm trying to build a series of lambdas that each have separate Pipfiles.
After cding into each lambdas fodler, I'm running pipenv lock -r | pip install -r /dev/stdin --target src. Unfortunately, it creates a virtualenv per invocation which wastes time.
Is there an easy way to just translate the Pipfile.lock -> requirements.txt format without creating the virtualenv?
Thanks!
