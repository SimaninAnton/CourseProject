Hi,
on my Mac i have installed python 2 using brew.
This has created a binary called python2 in /usr/local/bin.
I have now also installed pipenv using
brew install pipenv
When i now create a project like mentioned in the docs using:
pipenv install requests
I see the following output:
Creating a virtualenv for this project… ⠋Using real prefix /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7
So my virtualenv is created using the System Python instead of my brew python.
What do i need to do to change that ?
Many thx in advance !
