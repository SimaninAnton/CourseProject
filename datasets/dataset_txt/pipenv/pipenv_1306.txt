With pipenv lock, I get a message that I can't decipher. It lists valid constraints, and then versions that fit within those constraints, and then says it couldn't find a matching version. One thing that looks odd to me is that it duplicates the versions found:
$ pipenv lock --verbose
Could not find a version that matches eth-account<1.0.0,>=0.1.0a2
Tried: 0.1.0a1, 0.1.0a1, 0.1.0a2, 0.1.0a2
$ python -m pipenv.help output
I'm brand new to pipenv, so apologies if I missed something straightforward.
There are a bunch of closed issues that might be related. Most of them said to expect it to be fixed in 11.8.0, but I have 11.8.3. Maybe this has to do with #1745?
Definitely thought I fixed this last night. Will have to inspect.
Expected result
An install without warnings.
Actual result
Got the warning about being unable to lock
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv install --pre --verbose web3==4.0.0b11
$ pipenv graph
