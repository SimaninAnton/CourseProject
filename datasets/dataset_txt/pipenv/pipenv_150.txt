Issue description
When running pipenv install <package>, Pipenv is installing the new package and updating all other packages whose version is not locked in the Pipfile. However, when only running pipenv install, e.g. after cloning a folder, Pipenv is just installing the packages as specified in Pipenv.lock - it is basically behaving like pipenv sync.
This is the first issue I'm filing, I hope I'm doing it correct so far :)
Expected result
Considering the Docs...
When no parameters are passed to install, all packages [packages] specified will be installed.
https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/
...as well as this Post...
pipenv install (without other arguments) is essentially lock + sync, so it is more like installing from Pipfile instead.
#954 (comment)
..., I would expect pipenv install to always install the latest package version "allowed" by Pipfile.
However, if it would behave like that, I don't really see the difference to pipenv update. But that's another topic.
Actual result
pipenv install does install the package version specified in Pipfile.lock.
$ pipenv install -v
Steps to replicate
Create a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock as it can be seen below and run pipenv install. The (old) version of Certifi, as specified in Pipfile.lock, is being installed.
$ pipenv --support
