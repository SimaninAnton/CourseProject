Im trying to install serverless-python-requirements,however, im getting the following error message :
ERROR: Could not find a version that matches serverless-python-requirements
No versions found
Was https://pypi.org/simple reachable?
ive attempted to clear the cache, uninstalling\reinstalling pipenv etc.. but nothing seems to work. i can install other packages ok ( serverless framework, numpy etc.. ). here is the pipenv --support details :
$ pipenv --support
