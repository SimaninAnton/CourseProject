Hi,
I'm running X260 with 16G RAM and a SSD and pipenv --venv is taking more than one seconds:
$ pipenv --three
...
$ time pipenv --venv
/home/bersace/.local/share/virtualenvs/testbed-ujqxzTi8

real    0m1,374s
user    0m1,264s
sys     0m0,084s
I expect this to be subsecond.
Can you reproduce this ?
Can you give me a clue on how to track this ?
Anyway, nice to have the better of Python and npm :-)
Regards,
Ã‰tienne
