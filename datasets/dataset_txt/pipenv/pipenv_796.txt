Issue description
https://docs.pipenv.org/advanced/#specifying-basically-anything describes the following usage to install pywinusb on Windows systems:
[packages]
requests = "*"
pywinusb = {version = "*", sys_platform = "== 'win32'"}
However, the text refers to PEP 508 which does not have win32 as a sys_platform. According to PEP 496 it reads:
After this PEP was initially drafted, PEP 508 was developed and submitted to fully specify the dependency declaration syntax, including environment markers. As a result, this PEP ended up being rejected in favor of the more comprehensive PEP 508.
As such, shouldn't PEP 508 also be used in the code example?
Expected result
I expected the code example to read:
[packages]
requests = "*"
pywinusb = {version = "*", platform_system= "== 'Windows'"}
Note that I understand that sys_platform = "== 'win32' works, but it was confusing not finding win32 in the PEP 508 documentation.
Actual result
