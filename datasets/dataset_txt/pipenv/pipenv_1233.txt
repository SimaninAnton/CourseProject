Some packages (sip from PyQt in my case), are installing some header files in the virtualenv, currently the include/ folder is symlinked to the system non-nt one, and so non writable.
The virtualenv script offers the --always-copy option (active by default on nt systems) to copy all the files.
The pew script by default forwards all the unknown arguments to virtualenv.
I have the local patch working because I'd like to use pipenv in my project.
NOTE: venv has a different argument, --symlinks / --copies, with the same use, but pew currently uses virtualenv.
add --always-copy option to pipenv install
add PIPENV_ALWAYS_COPY env var
add tests
