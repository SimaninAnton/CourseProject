525ed78 introduced a new section to core.py that contains package_names.copy(). The variable is a list, the copy method is only available for lists in Python 3. The following error is raised:
  File ".../lib/python2.7/site-packages/pipenv/core.py", line 1828, in do_install
    for i, package_name in enumerate(package_names.copy()):
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'copy'
