I'm using fish and looks pipenv works fine without shell command:
❰/private/tmp/asd❱✔≻ pipenv shell
Spawning virtualenv shell (/usr/local/bin/fish).
Unsupported use of '||'. In fish, please use 'COMMAND; or COMMAND'.
/private/tmp/asd/.venv/bin/activate (line 23):     if [ -n "${BASH-}" ] || [ -n "${ZSH_VERSION-}" ] ; then
                                                                         ^

Seems it is trying to active the virtualenv with bin/active, but virtualenv also support fish via bin/active.fish, i think we can source it while detected current shell is fish.
And also, i think pipenv dose not support csh / cmd.exe now...
