Pip 18.1 is quite buggy, constantly throwing up TypeError: 'module' object is not callable and breaking installs on Windows machines, so I'd like to tell pipenv to only ever use 18.0 until pip gets a fix in some next version. However, while there is a pipenv --python ... command, there does not appear to be a pipenv --pip 18.0 that I can set to ensure pipenv doesn't use the wrong pip version.
I can't find any mention about this in the docs, so: how do I make pipenv use an explicit version of pip when invoking it? Or even better, how do I configure pipenv so that it picks my preferred version of pip by default, unless I tell it not to using a flag?
