For me on ubuntu there's a warning about pew not being in the path, while it certainly is.
$ python --version
Python 3.5.4
$ pip --version
pip 9.0.1 from /home/bogn/.pyenv/versions/3.5.4/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
$ pyenv --version
pyenv 1.1.5-7-gaf8cca9
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.2.7
$ pipenv install flask
Creating a virtualenv for this project…
⠋Warning: it looks like pew is not in your PATH. We cannot continue until this is resolved.
$ pew version
1.1.0
At first I thought that the issue is that I modified the $PATH in ~/.bashrc, not in ~/.profile. But after adding it to .profile as well it still doesn't work. Note that I've used pyenv and it's plugin python-build to install python. Installing and uninstalling pew[pythonz] didn't help either. Reinstalling pipenv also wasn't succesful.
Expected result
I would have expected that pipenv creates a new env and installs flask into it.
Actual result
$ pipenv install flask --verbose
