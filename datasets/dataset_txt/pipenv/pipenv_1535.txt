pew has this ability to associate a directory to a virtualenv and a name. If you activate the virtualenv using the project name, it will not only activate the virtualenv but also cd into the directory.
If you use the command line a lot, it's very handy because no matter where you are, you can quickly move into your project and activate a virtualenv.
One way to implement it in pipenv would be:
Adding an option to pipenv install to set the project name. E.G pipenv install --project=foo
Adding a new subcommand to cd in the directory and open a virtualenv shell. e.g: pipenv go foo. If a virtualenv is activated, you can omit the project name, even if you didn't set any name, and it will take you to the directory associated with the currently activated virtualenv.
Adding a new subcommand to set the project name afterward, if you forgot about it. e.g: pipenv nameproject foo
We can even imagine integration with the new script feature of pipenv by providing pipenv gorun foo runserver which would cd, activate, then run the associated script, with the project name being optional if you are in a venv.
