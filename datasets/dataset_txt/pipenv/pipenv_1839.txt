Be sure to check the existing issues, both open and closed.
Describe the issue briefly here.
Describe your environment
Ubuntu 17
Python version: Python 2.7.13
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 8.3.2
Expected result
I don't really know what this is supposed to do, but this leads to further errors. Also, quite obviously, the error message didn't interpolate values correctly.
Actual result
Error: the command sphinx-build could not be found within PATH.
Steps to replicate
I'm trying to execute pipenv run sphinx-build from a SCons file, which is executed by calling pipenv run scons. Obviously, sphinx-build is installed in the virtual environment of the project where this is being run.
