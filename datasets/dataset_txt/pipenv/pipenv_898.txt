The package "django-timezone-field" successfully installs but once it's listed as a dependency the lock file will no longer update.
Running pipenv 2018.6.25, Python 2.7.15
Expected result
After installing django-timezone-field, the lock file should update or produce an error.
Actual result
It doesn't update, and any dependencies added in the future will not be added to the lock file either.
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv --two
$ pipenv install django-timezone-field
No lockfile will be created, pipenv lock will not create one, and future installs will not create one either.
