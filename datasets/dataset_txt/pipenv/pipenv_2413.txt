We would have to use pipenv shell while building a CLI project. So, once we switch to the new shell and suppose if we forgot and executed pipenv shell again it then creates a new shell once again and we have to exit two times to get back to the default shell.
It'd be great if we have already used pipenv shell, the next time it maybe gives a message saying "You're already in the pipenv shell".
