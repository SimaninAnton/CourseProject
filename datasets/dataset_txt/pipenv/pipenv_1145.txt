Running pipenv --update (with pipenv 9.0.0) fails with an error like the following:
ValueError: 11.10.1.dev5 is not valid SemVer string
This is presumably due to the release of dev versions of v11.10.1 over the last few days. Multiple runs of the command will fail on different dev versions. (I believe the problem is that, according to SemVer spec item 9, pre-release data should be separated by a hyphen, not a dot; thus the above version should be 11.10.1-dev.5.)
