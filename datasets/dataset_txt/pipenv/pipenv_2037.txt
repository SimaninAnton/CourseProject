Shocked at the version number jumps pipenv has made lately, I updated and pip --envs guided me to what I wanted (locating venvs with a project);
$ pipenv --envs
The following environment variables can be set, to do various things:

  - PIPENV_SHELL_FANCY
  - PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT
  - PIPENV_COLORBLIND
  - PIPENV_NOSPIN
  - PIPENV_PIPFILE
  - PIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION
  - PIPENV_DONT_LOAD_ENV
  - PIPENV_YES
  - PIPENV_MAX_SUBPROCESS
  - PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH
  - PIPENV_VIRTUALENV
  - PIPENV_USE_SYSTEM
  - PIPENV_USE_HASHES
  - PIPENV_SKIP_VALIDATION
  - PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION
  - PIPENV_HIDE_EMOJIS
  - PIPENV_TIMEOUT
  - PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT
  - PIPENV_DONT_USE_PYENV
  - PIPENV_SHELL

You can learn more at:
   http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html#configuration-with-environment-variables
Problem is: that link is broken ("Sorry - that page doesn't exist").
Ok - no problem. I'll search for "configuration with environment variables" - great! Two links found; one that looks like a TOC entry, and one like the section I want. But - both those links are broken too.
What gives?
Well, it turns out that taking the /en/latest out of any of those links gets you to the desired place.
And (in general!) you might want to avoid locking links on to the en encoding, anyway.
