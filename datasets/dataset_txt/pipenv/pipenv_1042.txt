I wonder if the team would be open to removing "for humans" references. Here are my personal thoughts on the subject, collected from a blog post I wrote a couple years ago.
People use the for humans meme so frequently on projects that it's original intent and meaning have been obscured, leaving only a meta-meaning -- which is no meaning at all. When I see it today, I only see the other person trying too hard to signify that they are "in". It is the opposite of some people's tendency to obscure things in jargon, but they both derive from the same underlying impulse.
There's also a whiff of self-deprecation implied, "X is difficult, so here's something for humans". But of course in order for a project to be useful, the maintainer must have a command of the subject, so it comes off as a show of false modesty.
When a new project comes out describing itself as X for humans, it somehow implies that any other libraries existing in the X space before were somehow not for humans. Since for humans is meant to connote sympathy for the developer, this label implies that other packages were not developer-friendly. In other words, it's a bit of a backhanded dig at other libraries for having bad APIs.
The audience for any Python project is always going to be a developer somewhere. To call your project For Humans is just a pretentious way of saying that you see your project as having a superior API to other projects in the same space.
Let the library speak for itself. Let others be the judge of it's quality.
I'm curious to know the pipenv teams' thoughts.
