My Ubuntu 16.04.03 is installed with Python 3.5.2. How do I setup pipenv to use Python 3.6 when my system does not have python 3.6? I wanted to avoid install Python 3.6 along side the OS default Python 3.5. I only want to install Python 3.6 in the pipenv shell/environment. Is pipenv design for use in my kind of requirement?
Presently, I am getting:
$ pipenv --python 3.6
Warning: Python 3.6 was not found on your systemâ€¦
You can specify specific versions of Python with:
  $ pipenv --python path/to/python
