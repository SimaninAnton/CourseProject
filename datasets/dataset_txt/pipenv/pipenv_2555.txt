You will not always start with a fresh project. Sometime you will have a project that works but is not cleanly structured and you want to convert it.
Tools like pipreqs allow you to scan your project, find the import of 3rd party tools and turn them into a requirements.txt file.
We can imagine use case for pipenv:
pipenv finddeps which does what pipreqs do, but only output it instead of saving it. Using --save would save it in the toml file.
pipenv init, which takes a non pipenv project, run findeps in it and then create the toml file with it.
