Hello,
Trying to install a module fails with the following error:
/bin/sh: /bin/pip: No such file or directory
I am using MacOS and have installed python and python3 using homebrew.
Then installed pipenv using pip3.
which pip returns:
/usr/local/bin/pip
and pip itself is found as a command.
However, if I use python -m pip --version it points to the default MacOS python:
pip 9.0.1 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
I am unaware where it tries to resolve pip from and does not find it.
I am not sure if there is a problem with my $PATH paths or the issue is different.
Thank you for your time!
