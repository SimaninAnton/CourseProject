pipenv --rm does not remove everything under the /user/.virtualenvs/<repo>-<hash>/ folder. It removes everything except the src folder.
This may be by design, but resulted in some unexpected errors when I did pipenv --rm and then pipenv install (to start 'afresh' and make sure everything is in order!):
Error:  An error occurred while installing -e git+https://github.com/MyCompany/MyTool@v2.0.1#egg=my_tool-2.0.1!
Command "git config --get-regexp remote\..*\.url" failed with error code 1 in C:\Users\Mani\.virtualenvs\MyTool-Vb5JMSd4\src\my-tool
Describe your environment
OS Type windows 7
Python version: $ python -V 2.7.12
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 10.1.0
Expected result
Would have expected it to just re-install everything (including a clone/install off of github). Manually removing the src/ folder, before attempting pipenv install does achieve this.
