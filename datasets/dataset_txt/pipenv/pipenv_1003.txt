Hi there,
I am trying to use heroku and face issue during the setup because I cannot install Django with pipenv.
Here I found a similar issue before but the solution is not working for me, so I think it's another issue with pipenv.
The issue I found is here:
#1838
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
https://pastebin.com/dPZ7D9gG
Expected result
Install Django 1.11.13 with Python 2.7.15
Actual result
An error occurred while installing django==2.0.5! Will try again.
-> It should install the 1.11.13 because I've indicated python 2.7.15 on the pipfile, not 2.0.5.
Steps to replicate
Install pipenv
My pipenv version is 2018.5.18
2.. Get the code from heroku.
git clone https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git
cd python-getting-started
Modify the Pipfile on [requires] field
Original: python_version = "3.6"
After: python_full_version = "2.7.15"
(I tried python_version ="2.7" but not working, too.)
trying to install
pipenv --two
pipenv install
(or pipenv install --system --deploy)
