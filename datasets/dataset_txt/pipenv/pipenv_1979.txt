At first I want to say many thanks to @kennethreitz for this great package. It makes working with virtual environment much easier and offers a straight workflow that fits perfectly in my toolchain.
So here is what I just experienced. I' m not sure if it is a bug or intentional. I just tried to uninstall a package which I before installed as a development package. So what I did was
$ pipenv uninstall -d somepackage
However the result was very unexpected for me. pipenv uninstalled all my dev packages. I then had a look at the help and it was completely clear and said that the -d or --dev flag uninstalls all development packages. So it was completely my fault but I could imagine this happening to quite a few folks.
I would suggest that the script should check for inappropriate parameters (like package names) and interrupt execution if they occur to prevent unintended uninstalls.
