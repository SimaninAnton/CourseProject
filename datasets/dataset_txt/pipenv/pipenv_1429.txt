Pipenv virtualenv created for a project, at the top of my project are a pipfile and pipfile.lock files.
When executing pipenv commands in sub directory (3 levels below), a new virtual env gets created.
I thought it would not be the case and pipenv would use the one at the top
Describe your environment
OS Type: Windows 10
Python version: $ python -V Python 3.6.1 :: Anaconda 4.4.0 (64-bit)
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version pipenv, version 11.1.6
Expected result
I expect no new environment to be created
Actual result
Passing the option --verbose to pipenv does not work
Steps to replicate
created a virtualenv with pipenv, and a pipfile
create some subdirs
in the subdir, execute pipenv --shell
It creates a new env instead of using the one at the top.
Please note that sometimes it works, sometimes not.
