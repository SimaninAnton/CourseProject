I upgraded pipenv to 2018.05.18 today from an older build (might have been 10.1.0) on my windows 10 machine, and now I'm having trouble using pipenv run to invoke executables I have in my PATH. It seems pipenv run doesn't resolve anything in my PATH.
For example, I have my IDE atom in my path and invoke it as pipenv run atom which worked fine before I updated pipenv on my system.
After the update, I now get this error:
$ pipenv run atom
The system cannot find the path specified.
(I also see the same behavior trying to pipenv run on any alias I have defined in my .bashrc.)
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
When <executable> is in my PATH, running pipenv run <executable> would resolve and run <executable> within the virtual environment.
Actual result
When <executable> is in my PATH, running pipenv run <executable> yields
The system cannot find the path specified.
Steps to replicate
I'm on windows 10. I guess this could be OS-related.
Open shell. I have replicated this on Git bash (for windows) and regular PowerShell.
Create an empty directory and cd into.
$ pipenv install --three
Have a PATH environment variable that inludes an exectuable, e.g. C:\Users\user01\AppData\Local\atom\bin (that contains an executable, here: atom)
Verify you can trigger executable from shell ($ atom)
Now try $ pipenv run atom
Get error message The system cannot find the path specified.
