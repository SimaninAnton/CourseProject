--system — Use the system pip command rather than the one from your virtualenv.

Deploying System Dependencies
You can tell Pipenv to install a Pipfile’s contents into its parent system with the --system flag:
$ pipenv install --system
This is useful for managing the system Python, and deployment infrastructure (e.g. Heroku does this).
I am having a hard time understanding what it does with these two descriptions. basic says it uses the pip command from the system. Which I assume means whatever which pip points to when you do not have a venv activated?
advanced says in the headline "Deploying System Dependencies". This makes it sounds to me it copies the system's site-packages directories into the virtual environment. I assume that assumption is incorrect?
The rest of the text in advanced makes it sound exactly like I am assuming it does when reading the basic text. But it is worded differently between the two.
To summarize:
Is my assumption correct that pipenv install --system installs into the same location as where which pip shows when you have not activated a venv?
Could this text be made easier to understand in both basic and advanced?
Thank you for a nice tool.
