Issue description
I've been using pipenv on Ubuntu 18 for a while now, installed with pip install --user pipenv. Have a concurrent installation of Anaconda. Both have worked fine until today, and haven't updated either of them. Rebooting is of no help.
pipenv --python 3.7 or any other version of Python hangs at "Creating virtual environment..." and while it creates a .venv folder and a Pipfile, however the Pipfile is empty.
There is no error, it just keeps going and going without doing anything. The --verbose flag doesn't give any additional output. Let it go for 12 hours and it didn't get beyond this, or throw an error.
Conda's virtual environment functionality, as well as running python -m venv venv both work to create virtual environments still, so it doesn't appear to be a problem with any system packages.
Expected result
A virtual environment to be created.
Actual result
Hangs on "Creating virtual environment..." with no error or result.
Steps to replicate
pipenv --python <any version>
$ pipenv --support
