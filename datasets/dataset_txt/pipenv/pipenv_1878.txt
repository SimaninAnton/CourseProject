I really like the ease of use of pipenv. But I'm still trying to find my way.
One thing I can't find in pip where I can set the proxy option:
--proxy Specify a proxy in the form [user:passwd@]proxy.server:port
As I often need to work behind a firewall at my workplace (a school).
Describe you environment
Mac Sierra
Python version: Python 3.6.2 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul 23 2017, 23:01:38)
pipenv, version 8.2.5
Expected result
something like:
pipenv --proxy myproxy
Thanks.
