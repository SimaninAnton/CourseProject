Reading #501 makes me wonder whether it is a good idea to check in Pipfile.lock for this particular project (Pipenv). Reading discussions about other similar tools (SO entry on Bundler) it seems it is generally recommended to include the lock file if you want everyone to work on the same dependencies (e.g. developing an application), but exclude if you intend to support various versions of dependencies (e.g. developing a library). Now that #295 is implemented it feels even more wrong checking in the lock file and tracking irrelevant changes all the time.
Another thing worth discussing is whether it makes sense to check in Pipfile.lock at all. I want identical dependency versions, but don’t usually care about host OS, and it feels wrong that the lock file changes all the time when I work on a Django website on two machines, one Mac and one Windows. Either I’m doing it wrong, or there should be some switches to mark whether a project is platform-specific, Python version-specific (the intention of #295 I think), etc.
