Not sure there's anything to be done in pipenv for this beyond maybe some documentation, but starting with an issue since it feels related to #1417.
If you include a local dependency in your Pipfile, -e . for example. pip lock --requirements will generate a requirements list that is not installable by pip. Trying to install it results in the error:
The editable requirement file:///path/to/your/project (from -r requirements.txt (line 27)) cannot be installed when requiring hashes, because there is no single file to hash.
The workaround is to manually remove -e . from the requirements and install the two separately pip install -r reqiurements.txt && pip install --no-deps -e ..
Describe your environment
MacOS
Python 3.6.3
pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
pipenv lock --requirements produces requirements that can be installed by pip
Actual result
pip fails to install when a local dependency is included with the error above.
Steps to replicate
From a local Python project with at least one dependency:
pipenv install -e .
pipenv lock --requirements > requirements.txt
# From an active virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
