I installed pipenv using pip install --user pipenv. After installing pipenv I was not able to create virtualenvs using virtualenv venv. I would like to uninstall it now but I can't find it in the docs how to uninstall it.
Environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: 3.6.1
Pipenv version: 9.0.3
