We currently vendor some of our dependencies to a target directory, using pip install -t. It would be great for pipenv to support this functionality! This is our main blocker to further use.
I think right now it may be possible to accomplish by having pipenv generate a requirements.txt and pass it to pip to do the install, but that's very manual, and loses features like integrity-checking, so it would be much nicer for pipenv to do it.
(I mentioned this at PyCon, just wanted to make a github issue too so I can follow it.)
