So I may have the usage wrong, but essentially I want to use pipenv in a docker container, but install the packages using pypy3 in this case, so I am trying to do:
pipenv install --system --python pypy3
This however gives the error that /bin/python cannot be found, which makes me think that it is ignoring the --python when used with the --python argument.
If this is expected then how do I install the packages in a docker container using another version of python like pypy3?
Describe your environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 17.04
Python version: pypy3
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
