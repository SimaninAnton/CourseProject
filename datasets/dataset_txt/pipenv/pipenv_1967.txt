I'm using devpi as a private pypi repository where I can proxy cache pypi packages and add my own in-house packages.
My pip.conf looks like the following:
[global]
index_url = https://pypi.priv.xxx/prod/+simple/
[search]
index = https://pypi.priv.xxx/prod/
Couldn't find another issue mentioning this problem.
