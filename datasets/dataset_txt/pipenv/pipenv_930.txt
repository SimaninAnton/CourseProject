Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I don't have a way to know which packages I'm using that have an update outside the version restriction in the Pipfile. I can do pip list --outdated, but that lists every package in the enviroment, instead of only the ones in the Pipfile.
Describe the solution you'd like
I think pipenv update --outdated should show every package in the Pipfile with an update. However it should be indicated which ones are in the version restrictions of the Pipfile.
For example, Composer color codes it depending on semver https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#outdated
