Pip 10 is changing its default upgrade strategy to "only-if-needed", which isn't the desired behaviour for pipenv's purposes.
In order to retain its current "upgrade everything to the latest version available" behaviour when regenerating the lockfile, pipenv will need to pass --upgrade-strategy=eager when calling pip.
(This issue replaces #418)
