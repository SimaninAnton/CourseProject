pipenv, version 2018.7.1
Issue description
We have an internal library that takes a few dependencies:
    install_requires=[
        'flask-opentracing>=0.2.0',
        'jaeger-client>=3.11,<4.0',
        'requests',
        'furl'
    ]
Both flask-opentracing and jager-client depend on the opentracing package.
I'm getting the feeling that this "mixed-sub-sub-dependency" confuses pipenv. When trying to install, I get this:
Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
  Hint: try $ pipenv lock --pre if it is a pre-release dependency.
Could not find a version that matches opentracing<2,==2.0.0,>=1.2.2
Tried: 0.5.2, 0.6.0, 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.0, 2.0.0
Skipped pre-versions: 1.0rc1, 1.0rc2, 1.0rc3, 1.0rc4, 1.0rc5, 1.0rc6, 2.0.0rc1, 2.0.0rc2
There are incompatible versions in the resolved dependencies.
This especially looks strange to me: <2,==2.0.0,>=1.2.2
Expected result
The packages should install nicely, as I can't see any dependency conflicts.
Actual result
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv --support
