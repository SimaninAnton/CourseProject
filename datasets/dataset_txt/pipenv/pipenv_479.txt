Issue description
If you are in a directory with spaces and '(' or ')' in the name then pipenv fails to work.
Expected result
pipenv to create a venv, activate it, and install other modules in it.
Actual result
pipenv created a virtualenv but could not activate it. The resulting error shows that the command path was truncated at the first '(' in the directory name.
Steps to replicate
On a windows OS:
py -m pipenv install pyperclip
$ pipenv --support
