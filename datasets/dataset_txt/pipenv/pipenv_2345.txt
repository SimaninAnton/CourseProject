There's an issue somewhere in the stack when we run delegator.run('pipenv install requests') in appveyor but we're getting no useful feedback from std_err. I've tracked it down to the emojis in easter_egg() but I don't know if this is a problem in the subprocess or appveyor itself not supporting emojis being written to std_out. This needs further investigation which I'd welcome anyone to look into. Otherwise we'll try to get this fixed in the next few days.
As of 3.6.0 (4703650), the tests run cleanly if we bypass the easter_egg call. Anything after that won't be verifiable on Windows until this is resolved.
