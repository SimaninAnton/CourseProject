I'm working on a project using the Serverless framework (serverless.com) and the way Lambda's are uploaded is to bundle all the files in the directory. The way you typically do this with serverless is to do something like
pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./vendored
Then in your python handler you'd have
import sys; sys.path.append('./vendored')
With pipenv I get the .venv directory but I'm not sure I want to bundle the whole virtualenv and upload that to AWS (or Google/azure) It would be nice if there was a command to generate a requirements.txt like output or install to a specific directory instead of a virtualenv for this sort of use case.
