Be sure to check the existing issues, both open and closed.
Describe the issue briefly here.
Describe your environment
OS Type MacOSx High Sierra
Python version: $ python -V Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version pipenv, version 9.0.1
Expected result
I created a virtual environment when I first "pipenv run python", which resulted in a virtual environment called "/Users/username/.local/share/virtualenvs/directory_name-w7QgSO1E"
Later on, I run "pipenv run python" in the exact same directory, and I expected the virtual env with directory_name-w7QgSO1E to be launched. However, that did not happen, instead, a new virtual environment called "directory_name-A5OeF-2g" has been created!
What's even more shocking is the fact that, when I run "pipenv run python" even later, a new version of "directory_name-A5OeF-2g" is created, overwriting the old one. Do you have any idea what is going on?
This behavior comes at random -- in other words, I can't specify the steps to create this problem. However, it happened to me just at the second day of using pipenv, so I guess it should not be something that rarely occurs.
Additional question: From Issue 796 (How does pipenv know the virtualenv for current project ?) I learnt that the postfix of the virtual environment is a hash of the absolute path. Is there anyway to access the hash function so I can check which hash is the correct one?
