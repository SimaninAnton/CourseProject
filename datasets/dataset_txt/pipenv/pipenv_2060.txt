Pip has an (ugly) mechanism for passing through arguments. When using SciKit Build, these arguments are used to control the CMake build. So, for example:
setup.py install -- "-DCMAKE_MY_ARGUMENT=ON"
can be handled as
pip install . --install-option "--" --install-option "-DCMAKE_MY_ARGUMENT=ON"
(pip also offers a --global-option, but don't provide much info on the difference; I assume this also gets applied to dependencies?)
pipenv doesn't offer a way to pass this through to pip, as far as I can tell. This would make the most sense with . installs, since build arguments are not be stored (AFAIK) in the Pipfile.
