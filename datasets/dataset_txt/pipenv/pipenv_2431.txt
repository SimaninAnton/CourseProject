Currently if pipenv fails to install (in my case due to hashes not matching the lock file, possibly also for other reasons), the error message is pushed off the screen by normal Collecting ... messages and the exit code is 0, despite the fact nothing has been installed at all.
It should return an error code and finish with a big red error message
To reproduce: Remove the virtualenv, change one of the hashes in Pipfile.lock and run pipenv install
