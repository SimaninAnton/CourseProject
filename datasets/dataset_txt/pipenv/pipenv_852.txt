While getting started with pipenv and reading thorough the documentation, I came across Configuration With Environment Variables.
Unfortunately, some of the items don't list their default value, and I'm not quite sure how to find it. So while I'm initially curious if anyone could point me in the right direction, I also think it would be useful to newcomers if they were listed in the section linked above.
