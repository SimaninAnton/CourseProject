If I run pipenv shell --fancy then when I run my script it complains that none of the packages installed with pipenv install are available.
IfI run just pipenv shell it works and packages are recognized and script works but it messes up the shell (oh-my-zsh/prezto/fish).
pipenv, version 2018.10.13
Python 3.7.2
