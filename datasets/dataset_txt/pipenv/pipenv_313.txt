thanks for all the hard work! i'm running devpi locally to speed up locking by using it as a PyPI mirror. while following the devpi server log, I noticed that requests are made for wheels for platforms and Python versions other than the version that I'm using. using the same mirror for pip without pipenv doesn't do the same thing, it just downloads the specific wheel for the platform and Python version I'm using.
