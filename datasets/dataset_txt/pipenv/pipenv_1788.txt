This is something that I am not sure if feasible but anaconda environments allow for the name of the environment to be set using a name flag -n. This would be useful for something like scientific computing where you will use an environment for a specific taskt (simulation, data science, statistics) and would like it to be named as such without creating a specific place for it to live on your computer.
