Issue description
$ pipenv shell alters the PATH env var by remove /usr/local/bin
Expected result
$ pipenv shell
$ echo $PATH
PATH should be the same as outside of the pipenv shell, with the virtualenv path added to the front.
Actual result
$ pipenv shell
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin is missing from the PATH, despite being present in the PATH before the shell is activated.
Steps to replicate
Running Ubuntu 18.04, using FISH shell.
