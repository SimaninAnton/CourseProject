We are using vanilla CentOs docker images. pipenv fails with the error
pipenv run python --version
Error: the command python could not be found within PATH.
How to reproduce:
docker run -it centos bash
yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
yum -y install python36u
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.6 get-pip.py
pip install pipenv
How to fix:
it looks like which utility is required by pipenv
yum -y install which

pipenv run python --version
Python 3.6.2
It would be nice to improve an error message of pipenv.
