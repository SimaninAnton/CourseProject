Hello all, I firstly want to say thank you for the great project. I have used virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper for a year, now I am trying Pipenv as it seems to be moved to pypa project. It feels really comfortable and safe to use.
In comparison with virtualenvwrapper, Pipenv has no command like rmvirtualenv. As far as I know, to do this, I check the path for the virtualenv then delete it directly as below.
$ pipenv --venv
/home/don/.local/share/virtualenvs/esl-S-0IVzfS
$ rmvirtualenv esl-S-0IVzfS  # or
$ rm -rf /home/don/.local/share/virtualenvs/esl-S-0IVzfS
The situation that I am concerning is when I delete the project directory and the corresponding virtualenv remains. Of course I may check the unused virtualenv by lsvirtualenv and remove it, but I feel that it is not a compact way.
I may be wrong with the usage or the philosophy of Pipenv, are there another way to do this? Or, is the manual removal enough?
Since I searched a bit but I could not find relevant issues, so I leave it here.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: 3.5.2
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
Maybe pipenv destroy?
