Issue description
The auto_envvar_prefix change from #3217 doesn't seem to be working. I have tried all of the following environment variables, and I remain unable to trigger pipenv install --system.
ENV PIPENV_INSTALL_SYSTEM true
ENV PIPENV_SYSTEM true
ENV PIPENV_RUN_SYSTEM true
ENV PIPENV_RUN_INSTALL_SYSTEM true
ENV PIPENV_INSTALL_SYSTEM 1
ENV PIPENV_SYSTEM 1
ENV PIPENV_RUN_SYSTEM 1
ENV PIPENV_RUN_INSTALL_SYSTEM 1
I am using version 2018.11.14.
Expected result
PIPENV_INSTALL_SYSTEM=true pipenv install --dev should install using the system Python, and no virtualenv should be created.
Actual result
A virtualenv is created.
Steps to replicate
Run PIPENV_INSTALL_SYSTEM=true pipenv install --dev on a project using pipenv version 2018.11.14.
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
$ pipenv --support
