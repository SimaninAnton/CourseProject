So, pipenv ships with a man page that can be opened with pipenv --man, but that man page has a few issues regarding usability, because it is just built from the sphinx docs.
I don't need any information about how to install pipenv. I already have it. (I don't need user testimonials either.)
It doesn't list the general cli usage at the top, which is one of the most useful sections.
The docs have a couple of links, which don't convert to a man page.
Example files are good, but more useful at the bottom
More, that I don't care to list right now.
Basically, it's not really a man page. It's a user guide in form of a man page.
That said, it's still good that there is something you can access (without an internet connection), but in the current state it's pretty lackluster. Pipenv needs a dedicated man page imho.
