I'm running into an issue with psycopg2 which I'm pretty certain is caused by the psotgresql libraries on my host having changed. I can fix the issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the library using pip in the virtualenv. Is there any way to do this directly via pipenv, something like pipenv install --force-reinstall?
