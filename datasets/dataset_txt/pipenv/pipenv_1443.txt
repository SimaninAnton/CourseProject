I forgot to cd to my project dir before running pipenv shell, and it created a new virtualenv.
Describe your environment
Windows 10
Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 11.1.5
Expected result
I would expect pipenv shell to fail when there is no virtualenv to start a shell for. I didn't see anything in the docs about the shell command creating a virtualenv and Pipfile.
Actual result
A virtualenv was created and then a Pipfile and then pipenv crashed with a SyntaxError (but I see there's already an issue for that).
Steps to replicate
Run pipenv shell in a directory with no Pipfile.
