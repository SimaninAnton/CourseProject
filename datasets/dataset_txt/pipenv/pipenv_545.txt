Issue description
The --bare flag is supposed to set "minimal output" in sync and clean, but I don't see any difference with and without it. Looking at the code implementing those actions, I see bare in the list of parameters for do_sync and do_clean, but they are not used anywhere in the body of those functions.
Expected result
No output when --bare is used in pipenv sync.
