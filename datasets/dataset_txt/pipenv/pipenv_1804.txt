I would like to have minimalistic installation of pipenv to do it's main task - the pip and virtualenv orchestration, without the additional features (code checks - flake8, etc.) E.g. we use different code check tools, or we do not need it at all on the production.
The project may split to modules, like pipenv, pipenv-codecheck, pipenv-..., etc. So a user may install, what she wants.
