Installing pipenv through Python 3 with pip3 install pipenv and initialising a Python 2 project with pipenv --two works fine, however pipenv check --style will use the Flake8 installed in the Python 3 environment as a dependency of pipenv, causing erroneous results since Flake8 should be run through the same version of Python that your code targets (for invalid syntax checks etc.).
Describe your environment
OS Type: Linux (Ubuntu Mate 17.10)
Python version: 2.7.14 and 3.6.3
Pipenv version: 8.3.2
Expected result
Given pipenv installed through pip3 install pipenv and an initialised pipenv project targeting Python 2, with a file valid.py containing simply print 'hello', I expect pipenv check --style valid.py to not return any invalid syntax errors.
Actual result
E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax is reported.
Steps to replicate
See 'Expected result' section above.
