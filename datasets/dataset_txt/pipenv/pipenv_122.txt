Issue description
pipenv lock --dev --requirements > requirements.txt 
generates a requirement.txt that doesn't include the default packages. It only includes the development packages.
Expected result
According to the documentation the flag --dev means
Install both develop and default packages.
(see https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/#pipenv-lock)
So either the documentation should be changed or the behaviour of pipenv lock --dev should be fixed.
