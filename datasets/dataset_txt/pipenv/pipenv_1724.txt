Environment
OS Type: docker python:3.6 (debian/jessie)
Python version: Python 3.6.3
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.0
Test repository: https://github.com/iknite/pipenv-system-develop
Expected result
Docker should be able to build the image since pyenchant doesn't need to be downloaded/executed.
Pyenchant It's a dev-package sub depencency of sphinxcontrib-spelling
Actual result
Can't build, a detailed log can be found here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/bbvalabsci/patton/builds/bznbtcjbawc73awzdknw8ih/
(there is more depencies than the isolated git repository, but the result it's the same.)
Steps to replicate
issue_repo=/tmp/pipenv-system-develop-issue && \
git clone https://github.com/iknite/pipenv-system-develop $issue_repo && \
cd $issue_repo && \
docker build .
