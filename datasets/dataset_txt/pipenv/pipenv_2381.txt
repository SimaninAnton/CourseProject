I couldn't find instructions on installing packages from git repositories. https://github.com/pypa/pipfile seem to suggest that the spec is:
pinax = { git = 'git://github.com/pinax/pinax.git', ref = '1.4', editable = true }
but i'm not sure whether this is supported or implemented.
I wouldn't mind making a pull request if it's not done yet.
