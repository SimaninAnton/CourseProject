I tried installing pipfile via pipenv install pipfile
Seemed to work OK at first, but then saw this in my ./Pipfile
[packages]
"8b8346e" = {path = ".../myproject/pipfile"}
Importing pipfile in my venv works fine. Bug seems to be limited to how the ./Pipfile gets updated.
I think pipenv got confused by the case-insensitive macOS file system... as ./Pipfile and the package pipfile differ just by one letter capitalization.
Describe your environment
macOS Sierra 10.12.6
Python version: 2.7.10
Pipenv version: 8.3.2
Expected result
I expected this in ./Pipfile:
[packages]
pipfile = "*"
Steps to replicate
Simply run pipenv install pipfile, then cat ./Pipfile
