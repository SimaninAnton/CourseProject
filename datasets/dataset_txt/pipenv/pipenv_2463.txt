I think it would be great if there could be a choice between adding the .venv/ folder to the repo directly and having a central ~/.virtualenvs folder - similar to virtualenvwrapper.
@kennethreitz, what do you think about adding support for this? I would be willing to take a stab at it if it is something you want to pursue.
