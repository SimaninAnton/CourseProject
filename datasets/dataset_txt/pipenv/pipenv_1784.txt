I'm not sure if this is intentional, but pipenv uninstall only removes the package, not it's dependencies from the venv. I would have expected it to be removed.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Windows 10, WSL
Python version: 3.5.2
Pipenv version: 8.3.2
Steps to replicate
$ pipenv install requests
$ pipenv shell
$ pip freeze
certifi==2017.11.5
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.6
requests==2.18.4
urllib3==1.22
$ pipenv uninstall requests
certifi==2017.11.5
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.6
urllib3==1.22
Expected result
requests and it's dependencies are removed.
Actual result
only requests is removed.
