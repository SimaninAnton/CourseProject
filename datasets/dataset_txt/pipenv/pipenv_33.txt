Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv.
Done. Searched for 'apt' and 'debian'. Found no relevant issues.
Check the diagnose documentation for common issues before posting!
Done.
Issue description
Debian Buster's apt retrieves an out of date version of pipenv. sudo apt update was ran before installation for sanity's sake.
Expected result
The same version of pipenv as served by homebrew.
Actual result
The version of pipenv installed is v11.9.0.
Homebrew on macos serves up v2018.11.26.
Steps to reproduce
Follow installation instructions on the pipenv github readme for Debian Buster
Check the version of pipenv after installation has completed
Thanks for the great tool!
