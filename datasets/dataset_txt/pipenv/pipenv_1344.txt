pipenv, version 11.0.7
I have the following project:
https://github.com/HearthSim/twitch-hdt-ebs/tree/7cb8315eb2740e520ac74b0dc93ab252a8199f69
I ran pipenv install at the root.
Now with most projects, pipenv detects requirements.txt. But before pipenv, I was using setup.cfg to define dependencies as it's less icky than requirements.txt and I can do pip install ..
Expected result
pipenv should have detected the dependencies in setup.cfg install_requires
Actual result
An empty venv and pipfile were created.
