I'm trying to understand the best practices for handling setup.py files with pipenv. Running into a few issues.
it seems as though requests[security] is not respected? I'm getting an ImportError: No module named ipaddress after doing a pipenv install. I do see idna and pyopenssl getting installed though.
when I change dependencies in my setup.py, and then try to run pipenv install or pipenv update those changes seem to not be respected since it's using the Pipfile.lock. I have to do some combination of deleting the Pipfile.lock or pipenv --rm before I can get the changes to register.
what's the best way to handle this type of stuff?
