Issue description
When using the --system flag, pipenv install will ignore any value of PIPENV_PIPFILE and try to install from Pipfile or Pipfile.lock.
Expected result
The expected result (and behaviour up to and including 2018.10.13) is for PIPENV_PIPFILE=Pipfile-foo pipenv install --system to install from Pipfile-foo, and not Pipfile, which may or may not exist.
Actual result
Running PIPENV_PIPFILE=Pipfile-foo pipenv install --system will install from Pipfile instead of Pipfile-foo.
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
$ pipenv --support
