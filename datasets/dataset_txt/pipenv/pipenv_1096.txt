pipenv seems to use virtualenv internally.
There are several known problems with virtualenv using its own site.py as opposed to Python's one, see pypa/virtualenv#355
In particular this means that Python 3 tab completion is not enabled by default.
A simple workaround (unsure how simple really) would be to use python's venv module in Python 3
