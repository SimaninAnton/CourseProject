Hi,
I can't seem to be able to start pipenv after installing it. I don't know if I'm missing a step in the installation process or maybe my setup is not compatible.
I am using pip via MacPorts so my priority PATH locations are /opt/local/bin and /opt/local/sbin. I am also using fish as my shell replacement (I actually was introduced to it and started using it because of the shell completion line in your documentation) and using virtualfish with the compatibility aliases activated to allow standard virtualenvwrapper commands (workon, deactivate.. etc).
I installed pipenv by doing sudo pip install pipenv. But after I try typing any of the pipenv commands I get fish: Unknown command 'pipenv'. Fish seems to recognize all my other usual commands except pipenv for some reason.
