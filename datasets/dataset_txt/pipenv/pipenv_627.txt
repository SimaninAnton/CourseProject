Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!), and make sure you are running the latest version of Pipenv
Issue description
I just updated to 2018.7.1 and pipenv shell starts /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash (so my prompt is gone, I'm running dash, etc).
Expected result
pipenv shell should start my shell.
Actual result
remram@axon:~$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environmentâ€¦
$  . /tmp/v/.local/share/virtualenvs/v-GWEjRKuf/bin/activate
$ echo $RANDOM

$
Steps to replicate
remram@axon:~$ pipenv --three
remram@axon:~$ pipenv shell
I tried running this in a brand new HOME with env -i HOME=/tmp/pe bash to make sure I don't have weird env/bashrc/... but same result.
$ pipenv --support
