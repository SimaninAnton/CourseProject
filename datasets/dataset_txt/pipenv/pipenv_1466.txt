Describe your environment
A git repository in any system.
Expected result
Updating project dependencies in different branches should result in a functional file when merging.
Actual result
When I change dependencies in different git branches, It fails when merging due to the signature of the file.
There could be a third file as backup of all the dependencies and use it to restore the project after merge.
Steps to replicate
In a commit with pipenv, branch it, change a dependency in one of the branches and merge.
