Issue description
Pytorch nightly can be installed using this pip command:
pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu100/torch_nightly.html
I am unable to install the same package using pipenv install.
I added this source entry in my Pipfile
[[source]]
name = "pytorch-nightly"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu100/torch_nightly.html"
verify_ssl = true
and added torch-nightly under packages like this:
[packages]
torch-nightly = {version="*", index="pytorch-nightly"}
Expected result
Installation of torch-nightly from pytorch's index
Actual result
ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches torch-nightly
Steps to replicate
Add the above [[source]] and [packages] entries in your Pipfile and run pipenv install
$ pipenv --support
