We need another section to specify test only dependencies so that during CI we won't have to install all the development tools as well.
UX-wise we have two options:
The first option is that pipenv install --dev will install both development and test dependencies.
To avoid installing test dependencies we can introduce pipenv install --dev --no-test.
The second option is to mandate the user to specify --dev --test if they want to install both development and test dependencies.
