First ，Thank you
pipenv is good
the question is
when I
$ pipenv shell
$ (myproject-__PQqsBP) ➜ /my/Desktop/myproject git:(master) ✗ >

$ pip install pep8
pip8 success install

$ exit
$ /my/Desktop/myproject git:(master) ✗ >

$ pipenv graph
pep8==1.7.0
pep8 is in output information

$ pipenv lock
Pipfile.lock is created
but pep8 is not in lock file
So when i in pipenv shell, pip install something ,then exit,
pipenv graph can catch the change, pipenv lock don't !
seem like
$ pipenv install pep8 --dev
the command is ok
pip8 success install
lock file will rewrite
pep8 in lock file
Can i Do?
could $ pipenv graph show packages in lock file
or something way to do with that
Is it the way design to work ?
