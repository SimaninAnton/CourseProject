I was trying to install pymc3 with pipenv. pipenv asked me whether I wanted to install pymc instead.
 % pipenv install pymc3
Did you mean pymc? [Y/n]: n
Installing pymc3â€¦
Collecting pymc3
  Downloading pymc3-3.2-py3-none-any.whl (1.2MB)
I don't know if this is the intended functionality of pipenv. I can very well imagine that this is intended and meant to reduce exploitation of typos in package names. Nevertheless, in such an instance I would find it much petter if pipenv mentioned to me that it actually found pymc3, but is suggesting another package name.
Describe your environment
OS Type
MacOS (High Sierra)
Python version: $ python -V
Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 8.3.1
Expected result
Either direct installation of pymc3, or if it is intended that asuggestion for another package is shown, a reference telling us that pymc3 exists.
