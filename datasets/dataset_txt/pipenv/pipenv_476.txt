Issue description
Environment variables are not handled in custom script shortcuts.
Expected result
The environment variable to be replaced by its actual value.
Actual result
The environment variable is treated as a string.
Steps to replicate
[scripts]
echospam = "echo $TEST"
gives
$ TEST=test; pipenv run echospam
$TEST
instead of
$ TEST=test; pipenv run echospam
test
If this is not a bug, it should be mentioned in the documentation (here or here).
$ pipenv --support
