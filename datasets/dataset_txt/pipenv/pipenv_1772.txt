Greetings and thank you for this sweet tool, Kenneth!
I have a question as I try to integrate pipenv into our make environment... Is there a way to make pipenv act w/idempotence?
Ex: With our current setup, we know that venv/bin/activate depends on setup.py, requirements.txt, etc, and we have a well-constructed Makefile such that if those files have not been updated, then re-creating the virtualenv is a no-op (make: Nothing to be done for 'venv'.). The virtual environment will only get constructed if venv/bin/activate does not exist, or if any of those course files are newer.
I can't seem to figure out how to get pipenv to behave this way. ie. Don't do anything if the virtualenv is already in-line with Pipfile.lock. pipenv install takes a good amount of time to return, and pipenv update does a purge before reinstalling everything.
Describe your environment
MacOS Sierra
Python 3.6.3
pipenv, version 8.3.2
Expected result
A super-fast command, where pipenv can check what is in Pipfile.lock and compare with the existing virtualenv.
Actual result
I don't know of a way to do this.
Steps to replicate
Run pipenv install repeatedly. If it's a big project each invocation can take some time.
