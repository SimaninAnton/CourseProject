For example:
I ran pipenv install django a year ago, then django 1.19 installed, and django = "*" was added to Pipfile.
Now I run pipenv install in a new empty environment, I want to install django that the version of a year ago, but django 2.x is be installed.
I think pipenv should be similar with npm: when I run npm install xxx, then "xxx": "^1.2.3" will be added to dependencies of package.json
PS: I know the Pipefile.lock will lock the versions of every packages. But I still think that the way like npm is better.
$ pipenv --support
