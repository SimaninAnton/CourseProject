Hello, i want to use custom python version (python 3.6 from pythonz). How can i specify that?
For now i see that there are option --three / --two, that passes 'python3' or 'python2' string as option to virtualenv. But on ubuntu linux / linux mint / other debian-based distros python3 version always outdated, so we can not use newer python version with pipenv.
