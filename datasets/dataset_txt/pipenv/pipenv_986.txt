Reading the basic usage tutorial through for the first time mentions python_version, but doesn't link to what the acceptable values are for that option.
Concretely, since my project uses PyPy, I put pypy in there, which appears to "work" in the sense that the virtualenv was created using PyPy when then running pipenv install, but I had to guess whether that was actually a thing.
