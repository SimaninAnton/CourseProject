The feature described https://docs.pipenv.org/basics.html#editable-dependencies-e-g-e was broken in this commit 0a48fa0
In the most recent version of pipenv (8.3.1), pipenv install '-e .' --dev fails with a TypeError from this line https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/blob/v8.3.1/pipenv/utils.py#L540
Since '.' is a directory and not a regular file, it fails the check on L539 os.path.isfile(req.path) and the Requirements object name is None when parsing this type of requirement which causes the exception to be raised.
Installing pipenv==8.2.7 resolved this issue for me.
