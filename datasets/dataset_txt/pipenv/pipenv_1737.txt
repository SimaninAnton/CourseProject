A proper way to exit from the pipenv shell is by exit command.
But I am used to deactivate through all these years.
And whenever I accidentally use deactivate I have to close my terminal window and reopen it again.
Is there a way to fix this somehow?
Maybe some way to recover from the wrong command?
Or disallow deactivate?
