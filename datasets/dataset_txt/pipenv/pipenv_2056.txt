The following was a little surprising to me. I should have been typing exit to exit the spawned shell, but typed deactivate like I normally do. A warning message telling me that running deactivate in the spawned shell is pointless would have been helpful.
>> pipenv shell
Spawning environment shell (/bin/bash).
source /home/csmith/.local/share/virtualenvs/gdbgui-VyTVnvfA/bin/activate
/home/csmith/git/gdbgui csmith@csmith-ubu(master*)
>> source /home/csmith/.local/share/virtualenvs/gdbgui-VyTVnvfA/bin/activate
(gdbgui-VyTVnvfA) /home/csmith/git/gdbgui csmith@csmith-ubu(master*)
>> deactivate  # would be good to see a warning here telling me I probably wanted to type `exit`
/home/csmith/git/gdbgui csmith@csmith-ubu(master*)
>> pipenv shell  # maybe another warning message here
Shell for UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT already activated.
No action taken to avoid nested environments.
