I'll be honest I can't find a reference to this in your code so it might be someone elses problem (mine?)
I'm running cmder on windows 7 when I do pipenv shell I get the following output
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' to return.
'C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Reproduce
install cmder into program files
launch one of your virtual environments with pipenv shell
keep a close eye on the output
My theory
My guess is, it is having problems with space in C:\Program Files. Which got me to thinking, why does it need program files anyway. I can only assume it's trying to call back to cmder to set up it's environment.
Anyway I'll download pipenv from the master branch later and have a proper poke around.
Tests
Installed cmder into C:/tools and it worked perfectly.
tried it in a standard cmd prompt and it worked perfectly.
