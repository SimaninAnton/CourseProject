I've been using pipenv for a new personal project and it's been working great! However when I run my script using pipenv run python server.py I don't see any of my logging debug statements. If I activate the virtualenv manually and then run python server.py it does output all of my logging statements to the stdout as I'd expect. Is this expected behavior? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
