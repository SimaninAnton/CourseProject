I am having issues installing Flask using pipenv
I have tried two approaches. Firstly installing from a Pipfile;
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
flask = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
I then run pipenv install the output of the command is as follows;

To activate this project's virtualenv, run the following:
 $ pipenv shell
The output of pipenv graph is the following;
Flask==0.12.2
  - click [required: >=2.0, installed: 6.7]
  - itsdangerous [required: >=0.21, installed: ?]
  - Jinja2 [required: >=2.4, installed: 2.9.5]
  - Werkzeug [required: >=0.7, installed: ?]
If I try to import flask in the python shell started with pipenv python I get missing library werkzeug error.
The second approach which works is to start without a Pipfile and just run pipenv install flask the output of which is;

I get no import errors!
Any help would be appreciated!? This worked perfectly less than a week ago...
