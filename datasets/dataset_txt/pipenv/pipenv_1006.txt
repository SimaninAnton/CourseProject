pipenv install -e local/subdir1 -e local/subdir2 fails with an assertion traceback.
Version: 2018.05.18
Expected result
That pipenv install -e local/subdir1 -e local/subdir2 would add both directories to Pipfile as editable installs, similar to the effect of pip install -e local/subdir1 -e local/subdir2.
Actual result
The second -e gets interpreted as a package to try to install, which then fails:
[snip successfully setting up the first editable install]
Installing -eâ€¦

AssertionError: This should match everything
Steps to replicate
Have two local directories that support being installed with pip -e local/subdir
Attempt to install them both as editable in a single command, rather than as separate commands
