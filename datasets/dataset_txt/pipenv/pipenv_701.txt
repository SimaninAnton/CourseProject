My Pipfile.lock contains many lines of the following form:
"markers": "python_version != '3.2.*' and python_version != '3.0.*' and python_version != '3.1.*' and python_version >= '2.7' and python_version != '3.3.*'",
and after an unrelated change, this line is changed into
"markers": "python_version != '3.0.*' and python_version != '3.2.*' and python_version != '3.3.*' and python_version != '3.1.*' and python_version >= '2.7'",
i.e. the same content but different order. It would be great to keep the order deterministic in order to keep the diffs small when updating.
