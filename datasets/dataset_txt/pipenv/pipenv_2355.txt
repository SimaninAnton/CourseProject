pipenv supports the format git+https://github.com/org/repo.... However, that will prompt me for a username and password. I expected it to support (as pip does) the form git+git@github.com:org/repo.... However, trying this gives the error message
Invalid Requirement: git-url from above
It looks like a path. Does it exist ?
