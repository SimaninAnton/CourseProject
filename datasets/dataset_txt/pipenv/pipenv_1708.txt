The messaging around missing Pipfile.lock seems to have regressed.
Describe your environment
macOS
Python 3.6.2
pipenv 9.0.1
Expected result
I expected to see a message indicating that a Pipfile.lock was being generated for me because it was missing. I believe this is a regression in 9.x.
Actual result
$ pipenv install --dev
Pipfile.lock () out of date, updating to (8ae34d)â€¦
Steps to replicate
Delete Pipfile.lock
Run pipenv install
