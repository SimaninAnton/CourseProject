hi there, quick Q. my hard drive is filling up and I wondering if you could suggest a command to run to delete "unused virtualenvs" (virtualenvs with renamed or deleted folders).
if the hash at the end of the venv name is reversible, I could use it to stat the project directory to make sure it still exists? wondering if you've tried something like this before.
closest issue I found was #202
