I see that today the different install groups default and develop are hardcoded. Is there a plan to have custom groups? For example, the very common pipeline dev, stage, production could be handled nicely:
[packages]
# default packages here
[dev-packages]
# dev packages here
[stage-packages]
# stage packages here
[production-packages]
# production packages here
[somethingelse-packages]
# something else packages here
