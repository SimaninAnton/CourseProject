I'm working on multiple projects at once, all using pipenv. I've noticed that if I start pipenv shell in project A root, and then move to project B and try to start pipenv shell again, it tells me that the shell for B is already activated. So pipenv is automatically switching between shells? Is this the desired behavior?
More concerning is that when I pipenv install an external package in project A, and then move to project B root and pipenv install it again I get something like:
$ pipenv shell
Shell for ws-storage-5jC_NMuk already activated. No action taken to avoid nested environments.
$ pipenv install --dev toml
Installing toml...
Requirement already satisfied: toml in /home/bob/.local/share/virtualenvs/ws-sheets-server-rkQt47xA/lib/python3.5/site-packages

Adding toml to Pipfile's [dev-packages]...
pipenv says its already installed, but references another project's virtualenv directory. Are my projects sharing their locally installed packages?
