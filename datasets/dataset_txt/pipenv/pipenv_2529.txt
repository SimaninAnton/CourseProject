Sorry if this is lame. As a regular user of Bundler in Ruby ecosystem, and package.json from npm, why not use
Python, which will give more freedom to express logic and other constructs
JSON, as it is human readable and parsers are available already
YAML, not as readable as JSON, but saves us from learning one more markup language.
Thanks
