hobbes:backend cdunklau$ pipenv run pip --help
Usage: pipenv run [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Spawns a command installed into the virtualenv.

Options:
  --three / --two  Use Python 3/2 when creating virtualenv.
  --python TEXT    Specify which version of Python virtualenv should use.
  -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
...that should have been the help for pip, but I got pipenv run's help.
Looks like this comes down to how click handles things. The workaround is simply to use --. Both pipenv run -- pip --help and pipenv run pip -- --help give me pip's help output. This also appears to happen for the other pipenv run options: --two, --three, and --python.
I'd expect at least a mention in the pipenv run help output about this, if preventing click's normal behavior isn't feasible.
