Issue description
pipenv shell is unable to activate the virtualenv in Travis CI.
Expected result
pipenv shell should spawn a new virtualenv so I can run the commands that have been installed (pytest, mypy, etc.)
Actual result
I get this output in the log:
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environmentâ€¦
 . /home/travis/.local/share/virtualenvs/pypokedex-308VNbI2/bin/activate
  . /home/travis/.local/share/virtualenvs/pypokedex-308VNbI2/bin/activate
bash: /home/travis/.local/share/virtualenvs/pypokedex-308VNbI2/bin/activate: No such file or directory
When this happens, the command doesn't end but no further output is seen. Eventually Travis times out because of a lack of output.
The example that can replicate this is this PR build. The build times out after 10 minutes.
Steps to replicate
Try using pipenv shell in Travis CI.
