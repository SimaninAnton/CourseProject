Hello. I'm having some trouble installing Rasa (lastest version: 1.1.3) with pipenv.
Just the installation works, but the process of "locking" presents issues because it triggers out the timeout after several minutes of waiting.
My pipenv works just fine with other packages, but only with rasa I've been experimenting this issue.
I absolutely don't understand what the problem is.
Please help.
Thanks!
Steps to reproduce
Install python 3.7
Install pip (in case of linux)
Install pipenv
Then, in the directory of choice:
pipenv install rasa
Environment
Same error in:
Windows 10 64 bits with Python 3.7 and lastest versions of pip and pipenv
Ubuntu 18.04 64 bits with Python 3.6 and lastest versions of pip and pipenv
Source
Pipfile
[[source]] name = "pypi" url = "https://pypi.org/simple" verify_ssl = true
