I use powershell as my primary shell, but pipenv shell starts a CMD prompt.
Describe you environment
OS Type: Windows 7
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.2
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 8.2.6
Expected result
I'd expect the shell that was started to be the same as my current shell (i.e., powershell)
Actual result
The shell is always a CMD shell, as far as I can see there is no way to change this.
Steps to replicate
pipenv shell. It's possible to work around this by using pipenv run powershell but this doesn't set $env:VIRTUAL_ENV (which I believe is a known issue).
