When running the example command at the bottom of this page: http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html#pipfile-lock-security-features
The install process fails with pkg_resources.RequirementParseError: Invalid requirement, parse error at "'--ignore'"
It looks as if it's treating --ignore-hashes as a package name and exploding appropriately.
I checked back and this last worked in v5.3.3.
