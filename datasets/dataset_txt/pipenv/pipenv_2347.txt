If I tried what docs suggest it doesn't work at all:
$ cat ~/.zshrc
 eval (env _PIPENV_COMPLETE=source-zsh pipenv)
Then I tried following:
$ cat ~/.zshrc
 eval "$(env _PIPENV_COMPLETE=source-zsh pipenv)"
Now I get following error:
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
