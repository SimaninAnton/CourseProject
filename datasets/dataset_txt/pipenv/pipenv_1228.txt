When installing a dependency through a wheel (using either https:// or file://), the initial installation will work fine and install all the library's dependencies into your virtual env. Running pipenv graph will show the dependency tree correctly. The resulting Pipenv.lock file though, will not have the child dependencies of the wheel (even after running pipenv lock again).
I created a repo that shows the error happening in one script: https://github.com/TotempaaltJ/minimal-pipenv-wheel-fail. If you clone it and run test.sh it'll run through the steps, executing them as it goes, to show that it fails to import the dependency after installing straight from a Pipenv.lock file.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
