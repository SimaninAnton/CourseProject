When using .env files, pipenv will not read environment variables that are prefixed with export which makes the files less cross-compatible with other uses, such as python-dotenv, or actual environment variable files for deployment scripts. I think it'd be useful to support the inclusion of export as an optional thing.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Project's environment variables are read when using export:
--- .env ---
export FLASK_APP=autoapp.py
--- shell ---
$ echo $FLASK_APP
autoapp.py
Actual result
--- .env ---
export FLASK_APP=autoapp.py
--- shell ---
$ echo $FLASK_APP
Steps to replicate
See results.
