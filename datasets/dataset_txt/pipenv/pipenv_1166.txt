I've recently found this tool and it completely changed my workflow, I feel like I have a proper NPN or PHP's composer for Python with virtualenv management built it. I've really liked that you can specify optional and suggested packages in composer and I wish to suggest that functionality for this really great tool:
The optional packages usually don't require for the project to run or develop but they could enhance the experience mostly for development but some cases to the environment as well. A good example could be: django-debug-toolbar, ipython, the optional packages for djangorestframework. I'm sure there is more but I just only used django in my first 6 month so far
Suggested packages are a subtype of the optional packages, they just a hook to make a note after you firstly installed the project from the really important options.
Both options behave just like the [dev-packages] but with a different flag.
Thoughts, Ideas, Opinions are welcomed!
