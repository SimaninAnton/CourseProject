Issue description
When installing local package, the logical check on this line does not work correctly when package name has -i in it.
pipenv/pipenv/core.py
Line 1873 in 29eb73a
 if any(s in line for s in index_indicators): 
Actual result
Pipenv tries installing a package called -e
Steps to replicate
Suppose you have a local python package named like marathon-python-internal
pipenv install -e ../packages/marathon-python-lnternal/
This results in the code flow falling inside the IF condition vs some other package name that doesn't have the string -i in them eg
pipenv install -e ../packages/funniest/
pipenv, version 2018.7.1
