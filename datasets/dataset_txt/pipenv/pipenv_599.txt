Issue description
After the latest patch for the incompatibility problem with pip 18.1, the pipenv parsing of the package name during installation no longer is working (it's replacing . in the package name for a - and this leads to pip not finding the available versions).
This happens with pip 18.1 as well as 18.0.
Expected result
pipenv install zope.interface==4.5.0 should install from this package https://pypi.org/project/zope.interface/
Actual result
Instead it translates to zope-interface==4.5.0 and then it don't find the package:
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement zope-interface==4.5.0 (from versions: 4.4.0, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3)
No matching distribution found for zope-interface==4.5.0
Steps to replicate
create new virtualenv with latest pipenv version (2018.10.9) to see it break, and test it with the previews one (2018.7.1) where it's still ok.
obs: I'm not sure if this is a bug in pip or pypi (not finding the correct version when replacing . with -), but since it started happening with the latest pipenv release then I believe it is actually related to pipenv.
