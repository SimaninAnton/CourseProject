Pipenv noob here, here is what I did, I had 2 terminal windows open:
pipenv install -d django_extensions on terminal window 1
pipenv run pip freeze on window 1 and shows the package
pipenv run pip freeze on window 2 and cannot find the package
Tried exit and pipenv shell on window 2 again, and still cannot find the package.
UPDATE: the package shows up on a newly opened window.
