Issue description
Using pipenv check --unused" in our project directory. We use the asyncio` package, but pipenv unused check is claiming it is not used.
Expected result
We do not expect asyncio to appear in pipenv's output check.
pipenv check --unused .
Actual result
pipenv check --unused .
The following dependencies appear unused, and may be safe for removal:
  - asyncio
(snip)
Without leaking specific implementation details, here is roughly where it might be within our project
$ grep -rins asyncio *
foo_bootstrap.py:10:import asyncio
foo_bootstrap.py:54:        self.loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
Pipfile:7:asyncio = "*"
Pipfile.lock:61:        "asyncio": {
, where self.loop is used throughout such as:
self.loop.run_until_complete(python_code_stuff)
Steps to replicate
I would hope it is:
import asyncio in a python file
use it in a function (there may be details here pertinent to reproduction which we have not specifically shared)
run pipenv check --unused . in the root project python dir
