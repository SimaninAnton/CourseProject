I am using the pipenv Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/pipenv/) to deploy images from it. Unfortunately, since it moved to pypa it hasn't been updated.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.3 (17D47)
Python version: 2.7.10
Pipenv version: 9.0.3
Expected result
I expected the Docker image continue to be updated on pushes to master on this repo or to transition to a new place on Docker hub.
Actual result
The old images are not updated and the current Dockerfile as on the master branch in this repository is not on Docker hub.
Steps to replicate
FROM kennethreitz/pipfile
gives me an outdated version and I can't make a pull request to fix things because the file is not synced with Docker hub any more.
