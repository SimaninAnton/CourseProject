It seems the opinion of the community is pretty unanimous:
NOBODY WANTS LOCAL DEV OS JUNK IN Pipfile.lock
See #753
I don't know too many people that use Mac OS in production, so many people using Heroku or similar tools will have to deal with their app being in a perpetual fugue state.
I haven't yelled on GitHub before... but I also haven't come across a thread on an open source project where everyone wanted to remove a pretty bad feature from something and then the core maintainer popped in and said:
going to remain, for now.
Then locked the thread to avoid hearing any other opinions on the matter (outside of the DPRK, we have an "Unsubscribe" button on the right side of the thread when we don't want the chatter).
