When I run pipenv uninstall, I am counting on uninstalling the package with all it's dependencies that are not shared with other packages.
Maybe having this behaviour by default is too aggressive, but having at least a flag would be awesome.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Linux
Python version: $ python -V Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
I would expect pipenv to uninstall all dependencies of distex (dill, cloudpickle).
Actual result
