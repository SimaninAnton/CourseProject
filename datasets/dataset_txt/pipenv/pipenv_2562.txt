I realise right now your tool does not needs to activate any env (I actually like it, it makes it easier for beginers to get in) but I will use pipenv activate eventually.
I would like to suggest to get some inspiration from pew for the virtualenv part. It has some nice benefits:
it's pure Python and works with any shell, even in windows. No need for activation script.
it spawns a subshell. Meaning you don't activate a virtualenv, you get into a brand new process. To exit the env, you just exist the shell (Ctrl + D). No side effect, back to your previous session.
