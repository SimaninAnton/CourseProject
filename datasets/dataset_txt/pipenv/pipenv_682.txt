Is there currently any way of running an executable in [virtualenv-path]/bin/ automatically after pipenv forks to the subshell? For example, I'm installing awscli in a virtual environment and I'd like to setup auto-completion with aws_completer which is installed with it.
Right now it seems like PATH is being set after .bashrc is sourced. Would it be a bad idea to do the opposite? If not, I could add something like this to my .bashrc:
hash aws_completer 2>/dev/null && complete -C $(which aws_completer) aws
