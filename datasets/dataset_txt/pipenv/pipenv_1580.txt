pipenv seems to have to be installed globally, it does not work out of the box when installing it in a virtualenv.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Mac OS
Python version: 2.7.14
Pipenv version: 9.0.3
Expected result
To try out this tool I want to be able to install it into a virtualenv without having to fiddle with my path settings.
Actual result
Creating a virtualenv for this project…
⠋Warning: it looks like pew is not in your PATH. We cannot continue until this is resolved.
As a workaround I used (Caution fish shell!):
$ env PATH=$PATH:./bin bin/pipenv install SomePackage
Steps to replicate
$ virtualenv-2.7 pipenv
$ cd pipenv
$ bin/pip install pipenv
$ bin/pipenv install SomePackage
