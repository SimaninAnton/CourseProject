Every time run pipenv command, it starts up very slow.
$: time pipenv run flask
pipenv run flask  2.83s user 0.61s system 81% cpu 4.209 total
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
If you're on MacOS, just run the following:
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Steps to replicate
$: time pipenv run flask
pipenv run flask 2.83s user 0.61s system 81% cpu 4.209 total
