I want to make a small script that automates running something that needs python2 with pipenv.
I would do:
pipenv install --two
pipenv run hello.py
The first invocation is fine, the second time I run this script however it says:
Virtualenv already exists!
Removing existing virtualenv...
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
even though nothing has changed. It's the --two option that causes this. If I remove that option it behaves as I would expect and reuses the old virtualenv, however then I get python3.
Since python3 is the default you don't need --two/--three, so then you don't have this problem.
