Having pipenv lock record hashes for each package version would ensure cryptographically repeatable installation. If this tool isn't meant for use in deployment, then this can be safely ignored, but the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock standards seem to me to be a good start in this direction, and some tooling around this would be nice. I use hashin for this currently, but it has some shortcomings (namely that it doesn't seek out dependencies for you).
Thanks!
