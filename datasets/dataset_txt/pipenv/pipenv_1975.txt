It has been mentioned multiple times that Pipenv cannot find find Python with a specific version on Windows. So you need to provide full path to python.exe, which works, but is less than convenient.
I think I have a solution to this. Newer version of the standard Python distribution comes with a py.exe launcher, that performs some registry magic to find the Python executable, outlined in PEP 397. In a gist:
py -2 finds the latest Python 2
py -3 finds the latest Python 3
py -3.6 finds Python 3.6
and so on.
I’m thinking about providing a Windows-specific implementation for --two, --three, and --python <version> based on the py launcher, but want to be sure this would be considered for merge before actually work on it. I’ll try to come up with a pull request if you think this is a good idea.
