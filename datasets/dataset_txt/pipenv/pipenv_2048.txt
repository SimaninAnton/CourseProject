Mr Kenneth Sir,
Your projects have a massive reach across the python community. I was thinking about python 2 coming to and end and how to highlight the issue more as the date gets closer and closer. How would you feel about having some kind of banner when using pipenv with python2 ?
Something like;
NOTICE: Python 2 will be retired in 2020. It is recommended to migrate your applications to Python 3.
As the date gets closer the Notice could become more prominent. At some point you will probably drop support for py2 in this project that could also be incorporated into the notice.
Its just a thought, I can completely understand if you didn't want to have the additional overhead of managing something like this.
Thanks for your time and the awesome work on this project.
