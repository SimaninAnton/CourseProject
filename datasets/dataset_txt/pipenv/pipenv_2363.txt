Hi, I wanted to freeze my versions in Pipfile, and I just wanted to point out, that there is no doc (that I could find) how to do this.
Say I want version of maya 0.1.8, so I created Pipfile:
[packages]
maya = "0.1.8"
This however gives error: can't install maya0.1.8. After going through the code of pipenv, it just concats the package name + version inside "".
To fix the problem, I had to edit "0.1.8" to "==0.1.8". I get why this is there, because of comparison operators "=<>". But there could be at least mention of this in readme, or it could be smart about exact match version - when there is no * or =<>.
Thanks for awesome project!
