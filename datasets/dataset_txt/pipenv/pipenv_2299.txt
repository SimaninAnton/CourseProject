When I run pipenv install I get the a stack trace ending in
OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [('system library', 'fopen', 'No such file or directory'), ('BIO routines', 'BIO_new_file', 'no such file'), ('x509 certificate routines', 'X509_load_cert_crl_file', 'system lib')]
This may be caused by the bundled requests module (v2.13) missing a cacert.pem file... see psf/requests#4019 ("OpenSSL issue when vendoring requests"). I can confirm that trying import requests; requests.get(...) with pipenv/vendor/requests on my path causes the error above while the same command using my system-wide requests (v2.14.2) does not.
