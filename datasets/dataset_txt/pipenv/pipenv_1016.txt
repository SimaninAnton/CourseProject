I am installing numpy directly from a .whl file compiled with the MKL extensions. The wheel file is called
numpy-1.11.1+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
However, using this filename breaks a matplotlib 1.5.3 install that we are also doing (pipenv incorrectly complains that it cannot satisfy the version constaint on numpy 1.11.1). However, changing the numpy wheel filename by removing the +mkl appears to fix the problem, but then we lose information about the MKL status of the wheel file.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
