Referencing an older issue, I understood lockfiles should be portable between different OSes now, but this doesn't seem to be the case.
As an example, I encountered the following error after running my deploy script:
THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM Pipfile.lock!. If you have updated the package versions, please update the hashes. Otherwise, examine the package contents carefully; someone may have tampered with them.
    oauthlib==1.0.3 from file:///usr/share/pip-wheels/oauthlib-1.0.3-py3-none-any.whl (from -r /tmp/pipenv-az9xn_nu-requirement.txt (line 1)):

I confirmed the hashes using pip download + pip hash on local and on the server, they're as above. Are there other factors that could contribute to this e.g. Python version? (In the end I did pipenv install <package> on the server itself, ugh).
