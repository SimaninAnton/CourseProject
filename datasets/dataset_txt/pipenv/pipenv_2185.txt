This issue is likely to show up on libraries that need to support both Python 2 and 3 where pipenv is being used to manage tooling. The feature:
Tell pip we're using the required Python version, with trickery, for dependency resolution.
is keyed off python_version = "2.7", but to test that this project works with multiple versions of Python, my build matrix also runs with version of Python 3.
Install Python 2
Install Python 3 and set this as your global Python version
Install pipenv 7.0.2
Set a required Python version of 2.7 in Pipfile
Run $ pipenv install --python=python2
