I have a directory
c:\temp\project1
I want to test that project in py2 and py3 from that dir without having to change dirs to enable a new venv.
It seems that with pipenv I can't create two venvs in that directory. As it will delete the previous one.
From the root of the project I would like to be able to do this:
pipenv shell --python 2
pipenv shell --python 3
or the name of the venv.
Does pipenv support this in any way - I could also use a hack if anyone knows of one.
Thanks,
Jon
