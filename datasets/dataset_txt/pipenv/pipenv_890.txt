I have a private git repository which I have in my Pipfile and it is marked as editable = true.
I can install this locally in my virtual environment no problem.
I am using Docker and inside my Dockerfile I run:
pipenv install --system --deploy
This installs my library into a src/ directory in the working directory. I don't know why it's doing that but is there something I am missing or is there a way to specify site-packages.
