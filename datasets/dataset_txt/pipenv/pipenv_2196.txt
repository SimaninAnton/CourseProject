Workon does two things. When executed with no args, it lists all available projects (i.e. venvs).
More helpfully, it streamlines the activation process when opening a new shell. This is super useful if you have dozens of projects you work on regularly. A possible syntax for pipenv could look like this:
~ $ pipenv work
blog
django
requests
supersecretproject
pipenv
~ $ pipenv work requests
Moving you to the requests project and activating the shell
(requests) ~/code/requests $
(PS1's might not be right for pipenv behaviour, but you get the idea.
This streamlines the developers' flow from:
cd code/requests
pipenv shell
to just:
pipenv work requests
It's a minor enhancement but something I'd miss moving from virtualenvwrapper.
