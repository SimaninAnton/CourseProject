Usually, I use a separate virtualenv as a replacement for my global / system python, (anaconda using pyenv), for quick testing stuff and running python based utils (like fuck, sass and some other one's i've made for myself.)
This means that i'm always in a virtualenv by default.
But this also means that if i try to use pipenv anywhere in my machine, i can't (untill i deactivate my
"pyenv global venv")
To be specific, this is what i'm talking about
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project.
