One of the challenges with carrying patches indefinitely for vendored projects is that it can easily lead to those projects becoming stale, and potentially subject to security vulnerabilities already fixed in the upstream project.
#1887 covers switching the regular vendored dependencies over to a redistributor-friendly model akin to the one that pip already uses, but that won't apply directly to the patched dependencies in pipenv (including pip 9.0.x itself).
One option worth considering is git subtree, since that takes full advantage of git metadata to help with pulling in upstream changes while retaining the downstream modifications. (I use it for this purpose at work, although I haven't looked at the specifics of how we might apply it to pipenv)
