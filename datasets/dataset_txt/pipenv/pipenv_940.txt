This is similar to #2165 even though I'm not sure if they're exactly the same.
Describe the issue briefly here.
pipenv update <pkg> does not update the lock file and fails to install the newer version of package.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
It should update the package
Actual result
It did not
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).
Create an empty folder and cd into it
pipenv --python 3.6 to create a Pipfile
pipenv install black==18.5b0
Edit Pipfile to say black = "*"
Run pipenv lock --keep-outdated --pre, keep-outdated preserves the 18.5b0 in the lock file while 18.6b2 is the latest version
Run pipenv update black, see that pip installs black==18.6b2 into the virtualenv and then pipenv install 18.5b0 back from Pipfile.lock since it did not update the lock file
