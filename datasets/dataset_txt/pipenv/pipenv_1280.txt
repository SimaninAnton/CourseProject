Hi.
I would like to report some issue. I'm running Python 3.6.4 v on macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 and everytime i create a new folder and try to
pipenv install django
i got this:
Warning: the environment variable LANG is not set!
We recommend setting this in ~/.profile (or equivalent) for proper expected behavior.
Creating a virtualenv for this project…
Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3.6 (3.6.4) to create virtualenv…
blablabla....
'python_version': python_version(required_python)[: len('2.7')]
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
This issue was mentioned here but i didn't find a solution that worked for me tho. So for everyone who faced this problem. Just simply put this in your terminal
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
Then u can install django and use shell.
Have a nice day.
