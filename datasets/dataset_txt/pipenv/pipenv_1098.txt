Would be super usable to support shebang:
$ head ./registry_mirror.py
#!/usr/bin/env pipenv run
but due the way hashbang is parsed by linux kernel and to be most portable for other OSes, this would only work if the /usr/bin/env argument is single word.
$ ./registry_mirror.py
/usr/bin/env: ‘pipenv run’: No such file or directory
so, i propose you install pipenv-run command as well, or modify pipenv behavior so that is able to detect such invocation scenario and behave as if pipenv run /path/to/program.py was invoked.
