can pipenv have an option to get sha1 instead of sha256? or calculate?
can pipenv have a similar command like "pip download -r requirements.txt" but for pipfile?
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
yes, when i have requirements.txt i can just do pip download -r requirements.txt but if i have a pipfile, without a requirements file, how can i download the binary files ?
it's good for me i want to calculate sha1 not sha256 which is given in lock file
Describe the solution you'd like
a command to download binary files from pipfile/lockfile
Describe alternatives you've considered
the only way to work around this is to convert from pipfile to requirements.txt then run pip download -r requirements.txt and then get the binary files..
$ pipenv --support
is not needed, i work on different projects and i want something generic, either to download binary files, or to have sha1 option in the first place..
