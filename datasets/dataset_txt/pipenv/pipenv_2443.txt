Hi Kenneth.
I think this package is brilliant. As a newcomer to the Python Community, I think pip needs many improvements, and that whole virtualenvironment process was a pain to understand in the beginning. Pipenv solves a lot of them.
Two suggestions:
Adding a shortcut command for source .venv/bin/activate
Activating the virtual environment automatically after installing it with e.g. pipenv --three
