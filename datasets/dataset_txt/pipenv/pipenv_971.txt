I have a small quirk when running pipenv shell with fish shell. When I run it, env var get loaded, and a subshell is spawned, but then it left me with a prompt, with a prepared activation command in it, the cursor at the end of the line, and I have to press enter again to activate the env.
~/path/of/work/dir > pipenv shell
Loading .env environment variablesâ€¦
Spawning environment shell (/usr/bin/fish). Use 'exit' to leave.
~/path/of/work/dir > source /home/my-name/.local/share/virtualenvs/my-env-name/bin/activate.fish [cursor here and command ready to run]
# press enter
(name-of-my-env)   ~/path/of/work/dir >
I expect pipenv shell to work in one go, just as it does in bash. It's not a blocking problem, it just feels broken. And it prevents from automating too.
