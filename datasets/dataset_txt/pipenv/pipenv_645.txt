Hi,
I was just wondering, for the [scripts] feature, how best I might inline a few commands. I'm looking to do things like for pipenv run deploy for it to first call a build script:
[scrips]
docs-build = "sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build"
docs-deploy = "pipenv run docs-build && aws s3 sync docs/_build"
The way I've found to do this, is to do something like:
[scrips]
docs-build = "sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build"
docs-deploy = "bash -c 'pipenv run docs-build && aws s3 sync docs/_build'"
I was wondering if there was a cleaner way of listing scripts that I've not thought of, like if scripts can take a list or undocumented pre-/post- command syntax. Just wanted to check as using bash might just add a dependency I don't need for platforms like Windows.
Thanks
