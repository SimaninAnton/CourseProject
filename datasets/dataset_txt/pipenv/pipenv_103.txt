$ pipenv --support
I'm currently working on a project that was previously using pyenv, virtualenv. I wanted to convert it to pipenv, but am having trouble. It's unfortunately a Python 2.7 project, and when I ran the pip install for the first time, when I saw that the generated pipfile had the Python version (thanks to a .python-version file I assume), I figured it'd be fine. However, a number of packages fail to install, and I see the error:
/usr/local/Cellar/pipenv/2018.11.26_2/libexec/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pipenv/cli/command.py
I tried pipenv --rm as suggested in another closed issue from two years ago, and recreated the env, and I see the message that it setup a 2.7.16 env, which is what I expect, but still get the 3.7 path. Any help in what I've done wrong would be really appreciated. Early apologies for anything blatantly obvious/stupid; I'm relatively new to Python.
