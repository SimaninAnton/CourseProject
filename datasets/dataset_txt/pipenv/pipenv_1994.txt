Is there any way to disable prompt editing, or can that be added? I like to maintain control of my terminal prompt, and with pyenv-virtualenv (on fish, at least), the prompt is not modified when activating a virtual-env, but with pipenv it is - it shows the full venv-name, including the random hash.
