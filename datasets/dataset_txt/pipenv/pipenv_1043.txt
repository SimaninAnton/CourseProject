Actual result
After shell activation, existing terminal colors are lost.
New colors will show as expected; only colors in the parent shell are lost.
Expected result
After shell activation, parent shell colors are maintained
Steps to replicate
On windows, using cmder or cmd.exe:
Print any command that shows color (eg. on cmder, ls)
use pipenv shell
(See gifs below)

Looks like the actual shell activation happens here
I tried adding stdout=sys.stdout to the f call as suggested here) but it did not fix. (I think that's already default check_call args anyway...)
If anyone has any guess of what might be the cause I would be happy to look further into it and prepare a PR.
Examples
Cmder
Cmd.exe
