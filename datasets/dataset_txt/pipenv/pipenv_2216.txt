Hi, I'm on mac os and have fish as my shell. Apart from a bunch of aliases and a couple functions, I've not done anything special to my shell. Oh i use ITerm btw. However I can only get pipenv to work ok only if I set -x PIPENV_SHELL_COMPAT 1.
I understand from comments in other issues that, its as a result of a misconfigured shell. Thing is I've spent ages trying to figure out what has been misconfigured in my shell and so far I've found nothing.
I'd appreaciate if someone with a similar system, terminal and shell can share how they've set theirs up so that, pipenv works without the need for set -x PIPENV_SHELL_COMPAT 1.
Cheers.
