Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
In my django projects, the manage.py isn't in the root of the virtualenv, so a common pattern before I used pipenv was this:
cd /project/django
source ../.venv/bin/activate
Which meant I stayed in /project/django
However, with pipenv shell:
cd /project/django
pipenv shell
The new directory is /project
Describe the solution you'd like
Either pipenv shell should stay in the same directory after using pipenv shell to enter a virtualenv by default or the command should have an option to indicate this behavior.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Changing the project root or just using the source command.
