I use comments in the Pipfile to help group and document related packages, but they are lost when installing new packages.
Describe your environment
pipenv 8.3.2
Expected result
New package is added to Pipfile at the bottom (or top) of the [packages] section, but the rest of the file is unchanged.
Actual result
The whole Pipfile is rewritten, dropping all my comments, whitespace, and ordering.
Steps to replicate
Copy this Pipfile: https://github.com/jacebrowning/template-django-demo/blob/fd4fb87ddb92601f435e333ae2e246b8af7462ef/Pipfile
$ pipenv install django-export-action
