Issue description
When creating a virtual environment no pyvenv.cfg file is created.
Expected result
When creating a virtual environment a pyvenv.cfg file is created in the root of the virtual environment. This is expected, becasue python3's own venv moduel generates it at least since some 3.5 version.
Actual result
See description: No pyvenv.cfg file is created.
Steps to replicate
Create a new directory.
Issue the command
 pipenv install
Check the virtual environment directory for the pyvenv.cfg file.
$ pipenv --support
