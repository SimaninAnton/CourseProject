Hi,
First of all: sorry about my english;)
I have some issue. I have project where i have requirements.txt with some requirements.
require.txt
but when i want to create env with pipenv with command:
pipenv install --two --require.txr
pipev installing some extra packages, not necessary packages. Here is my pipfile and pipfile.lock:
Pipfile.txt
Pipfile.lock.txt
and i can't run my django project, becouse i still have issues with imports, missing modules etc.
The best thing is that, when i create env with:
pipenv install --two
and install my require with:
pip install -r require.txt
everything works fine.
Describe your environment
OS Type ANY
Python version: $ python -V 2.7.14
