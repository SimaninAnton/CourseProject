In reality I am having issues with my own repos but I decided to test with something more official and it showed the same issues. I would expect the following sequence of commands to work on Windows but it does not. It does work in Linux.
pipenv install -ve git+https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#egg=pipenv
pipenv --rm
pipenv install -v
Instead of working I get an error from the last one including the following (full log in gist above).
Command "git config --get-regexp remote\..*\.url" failed with error code 1 in C:\Users\FSTAB\.virtualenvs\test7-QkksyU_j\src\pipenv
Note that at the end the pipenv source directory is nearly empty and it's .git directory is as well.
