I would like to install a company proprietary internal package that is shipped with the project. Is only available in a folder relative to the project root and it's absolute path may vary between environments.
This is at least connected to #958 and #914
Expected result
That the package multiinfo would be installed and put in the Pipfile in a way that can be used on production environment.
Steps to replicate
Create a non-published not generally available python package,
Create a dist python setup.py bdist_wheel
Install resulting wheel with pipenv
Actual result
$ pipenv install --verbose requirements/local/multiinfo-0.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
$ python -m pipenv.help output
