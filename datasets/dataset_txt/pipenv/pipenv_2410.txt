Is it possible to use pypy or pypy3 instead of the regular cpython equivalents?
I've given it a try with pipenv --python pypy3, and while inside pipenv shell, running python puts me in a pypy3 repl as I'd expect (which is amazing, by the way!).
Unfortunately from that point onward I don't seem to be able to install any packages, as installation fails with this mysterious error:
bash-3.2$ pipenv install simplejson
Installing simplejson...
Collecting simplejson

Error:  An error occurred while installing simplejson!
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement simplejson (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for simplejson
Is there something I'm missing, or is this something that the pipenv project currently doesn't support? If it's the latter I'd be happy to contribute, if you have recommendations for where to get started.
Thanks for the project, it's saved countless hours of headaches already
