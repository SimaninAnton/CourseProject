I've been searching the docs and Googling but I couldn't find anything related.
Since you are also an Anaconda/ST3 user, can you describe the recommended setup for using it with Anaconda?
Previously, with virtualenvwrapper I've been putting .anaconda files in all my projects, with the following contents:
{
  "python_interpreter": "~/.virtualenvs/my_project/bin/python"
}
This worked perfectly, the only downside possibly being that it wouldn't work in multi-team projects where teammates would put the virtualenv folder in custom locations, or if someone would have used Windows.
Now with pipenv, the virtualenv has a random/hashed name, thus it's not even possible to just type it in a .anaconda file. How do you solve this?
I guess by the cleanest solution in the future would be to do a PR for Anaconda plugin to have built in support for Pipfiles, did anyone work on such?
