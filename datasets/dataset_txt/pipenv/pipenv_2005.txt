Search results in the docs seem to have the wrong prefix, eg:
https://docs.pipenv.org/search.html?q=requirements.txt&check_keywords=yes&area=default
The first result points to https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/basics.html?highlight=requirements.txt, but should point to https://docs.pipenv.org/basics.html?highlight=requirements.txt (note the extra en/latest/ in the first link).
