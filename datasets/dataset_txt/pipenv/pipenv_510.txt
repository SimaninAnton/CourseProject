Issue description
Pipenv works when you just install it. However, after rebooting PC (I'm on Windows), it no longer works.
Expected result
I expect the python shell command to work every time.
Actual result
pipenv shell 'pipenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
Steps to replicate
1/CD to folder with pipfile
2/In CMD: pip install pipenv (installs fine)
3/In CMD: pipenv shell (works fine)
RESTART COMPUTER
1/Go to same directory
2/pipenv shell --> FAILS with message I pasted in "Actual Result"
Content Pipfile:
[[source]]

Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
I can not. It says:
'pipenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I checked the PATH and I have both Python as the Scripts location added there. When I run pipenv install after the above, it says it is already installed:

When I remove virtualenv & pipenv and then reinstall pipenv, it works again until the next time I reboot my computer.
