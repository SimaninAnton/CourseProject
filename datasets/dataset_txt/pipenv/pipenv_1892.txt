I tried installing Django prelease using pipenv, here are the steps I followed
pipenv lock --pre
pipenv install --pre Django
And when I check the pip freeze it shows me correct version of the Django
(fiobot-dPUFI04r) simon@ENGINE:~/Nightybuild/fiobot$ pip freeze
Django==2.0b1
gunicorn==19.7.1
pytz==2017.2
However when I looked into Pipfile.lock it shows this "version": "==1.11.6"
I deployed to Heroku my code doesn't run because my code needs pre release version of Django how to solve this ?
My environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Python version: Python 3.6.3
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 8.2.7
