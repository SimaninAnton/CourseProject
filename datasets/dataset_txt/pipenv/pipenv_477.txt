Issue description
In 714ff65 commit, I got confused in several places.
For now, even pipenv lock have --skip-lock option? This option does not exist for any released pipenv versions. It is introduced in
pipenv/pipenv/cli/options.py
Line 356 in 3ce8d7c
 f = skip_lock_option(f) 
.
According to the doc, pipenv uninstall --all will purge all files from the virtual environment, but leave the Pipfile untouched. But for now, from this code https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/pipenv/core.py#L2115-L2133, the pipfile and pipfile.lock will be updated anyway.
A @option("--skip-lock/--lock", is_flag=True, default=False, help="Lock afterwards.") is introduced in
pipenv/pipenv/cli/command.py
Line 256 in 3ce8d7c
 @option("--skip-lock/--lock", is_flag=True, default=False, help="Lock afterwards.") 
which confused me. A skip-lock option is already added by @uninstall_options. Besides, it looks like this option is not passed into do_uninstall which means it does not work at all.
Let me know if I'm wrong.
