Issue description
Should I run pipenv install fakePackage, the installation fails as expected. However the problem arises because Pipenv still adds fakePackage = * to the Pipfile. This causes all subsequent pipenv install commands to fail.
Expected result
I expect that Pipenv only adds the dependency to the Pipfile after a successful resolution.
Actual result
Seems to add to the Pipfile first, before attempting the resolution
Steps to replicate
pipenv install foobarpackage. Error is received as expected
pipenv install hatch (a real package). This time hatch seems to install, but there is now an error dump about being unable to resolve foobarpackage.
$ pipenv --support
