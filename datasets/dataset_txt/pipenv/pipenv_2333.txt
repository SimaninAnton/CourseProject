Hi,
I was able to create a virtualenv using pipenv ($pipenv install --three --dev) and I've noticed a new virtualenv was created in ~/.virtualenvs/deploy-HshZVj8N.
However, I was wondering if I could specify the name for the virtualenv using pipenv so I could give it a more human-friendly name. Is that possible?
