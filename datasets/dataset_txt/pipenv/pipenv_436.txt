Issue description
When trying to install pycountry (either via Pipfile or pipenv install pycountry), pipenv becomes stuck on the installing stage. There are unfortunately no errors or outputs that I have been able to generate to narrow this issue down.
Expected result
The pycountry package to be installed.
Actual result
  $ pipenv install pycountry --verbose
  Installing pycountryâ€¦
  [    ] Installing...Installing 'pycountry'
  $ ['C:\\Users\\Studybuffalo\\.virtualenvs\\test-23MAWioC\\Scripts\\pip.exe', 'install', '--verbose', '--upgrade', 'pycountry', '-i', 'https://pypi.org/simple']
  [  ==] Installing...
The "Installing" output continues indefinitely (have left it for over an hour). When cancelling the install the only output is: FAIL
Steps to replicate
Using Windows 10, Python 3.7.1, and pipenv 2018.11.14:
pipenv install pycountry
Other Details
Pipenv installed via pip (pip install pipenv==2018.11.14)
Output from pipenv --support
$ pipenv --support
Attempted Fixes
The following attempts did not result in any changes to the above:
Installing in a fresh virtual environment.
Clearing the cache when installing (with the --clear option).
Downgrading pipenv version to 2018.10.13 and 2018.10.09.
Reducing the PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT variable to < 60 seconds to trigger a timeout.
Running installation with Administrator rights.
Verified installations work by installing other packages (django in the above output for example)
The following attempts had varying success:
Installing pycountry via pip (pip install pycountry) in pipenv shell works. The Pipfile was not updated, but pycountry was listed with pipenv graph.
Installing into an Ubuntu 16.04 server worked as expected. pipenv --support output as follows:
$ pipenv --support
