Trying to create a virtual environment with pipenv-python 3.7 will end up with a MemoryError after being held for a very long time.
At that time, a large number of logs such as 'Running virtualenv with interpreter C: \ Program Files \ Python37 \ python.exe' appear.
The virtual environment is not created when only 'Pipfile' is created.
The contents of 'Pipfile' are empty.
Looking at the processes in the task manager, you can see that the python processes are constantly increasing while creating the virtual environment.
Python was installed from the official site binary and was installed as pip install pipinv after pip install --upgrade pip.
The 'PIPENV_VENN_PROJECT' environment variable is 'true'.
