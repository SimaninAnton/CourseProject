pipenv lists pathlib2==2.1.0 as a requirement (for python2.7). More recent versions of pathlib2 are newer than 2.1.0 have been released. If you have a newer version installed, pipenv throws an error.
Does pipenv really only work with pathlib2 2.1.0?
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
