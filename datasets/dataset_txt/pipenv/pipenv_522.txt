I am having an issue installing extra requirements from drf-yasg
Issue description
pipenv install drf-yasg[validation]
drf-yasg = {extras = ["validation"], version = "*"} is added to pipfile
pipenv lock --clear
pipenv, version 2018.10.13
Actual result
After every operation, pipenv prints:
Ignoring flex: markers 'extra == "validation"' don't match your environment
If installing using pip install -r requirements.txt no errors are issued.
$ pipenv --support
