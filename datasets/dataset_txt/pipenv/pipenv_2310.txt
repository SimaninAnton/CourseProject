I need to install Twisted[tls,http2] and while i can kinda do that, its not saved in my Pipfile!
Pipenv will install the right stuff and lock every package that is currently installed (with the lock command), but as soon as i tell it to update, any additional package not mentioned in the Pipfile will be gone.
So please fix:
pipenv install Twisted[tls,http2]
pipenv, version 4.1.1
