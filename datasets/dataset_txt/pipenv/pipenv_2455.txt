There is a default depth of 3 for the recursive search of a Pipfile. For projects with a deeper file hierarchy it's difficult/confusing to use pipenv. For example I have already created a virtualenv on the root dir, then I move 4 directories down, and I do pipenv install Something and I end up with a new virtualenv in that directory. This behavior should be documented and it would be nice to be able to configure the depth (for example with a flag). I can create a PR if this is desirable.
