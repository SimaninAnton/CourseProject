I'm trying to initialize a production environment from Pipfile.lock. I have an empty directory with a Pipfile.lock and run pipenv sync. It fails with the following message:
Error: Pipfile.lock is missing! You need to run $ pipenv lock first.
Aborted!
Note that Pipfile.lock is there. It's rather the Pipfile that is missing but my understanding is that you don't need it when you do pipenv sync.
