After modifiying Pipfile/Pipfile.lock (i.e. after a git checkout) I would expect that there is a simple command, that syncs the changes back to the virtual environment. Ideally it is done automaticially when running pipenv shell/pipenv run. At least I would expect pipenv check to warn if Pipfile does not matcb to the environment any more.
But neither did I find a command to sync the files with environment manually nor did run/shell sync them automaticially nor did check return errors.
What I did was:
pipenv install <packagename>==<version1>
save Pipfile (i.e. by git commit)
pipenv install <packagename>==<version2>
restore Pipfile (i.e. by git checkout)
run any pipenv command => commands are done within an environment that has installed
