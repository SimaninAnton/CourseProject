Excited pipenv user here. I don't understand what several of the commands do. Here is the output of pipenv:
Commands:
  check      Checks for security vulnerabilities and against PEP 508 markers
             provided in Pipfile.
  clean      Uninstalls all packages not specified in Pipfile.lock.
  graph      Displays currentlyâ€“installed dependency graph information.
  install    Installs provided packages and adds them to Pipfile, or (if none
             is given), installs all packages.
  lock       Generates Pipfile.lock.
  open       View a given module in your editor.
  run        Spawns a command installed into the virtualenv.
  shell      Spawns a shell within the virtualenv.
  sync       Installs all packages specified in Pipfile.lock.
  uninstall  Un-installs a provided package and removes it from Pipfile.
  update     Runs lock, then sync.
lock "Generates Pipfile.lock." Is it doing that based on the current environment, or based on what's specified in the Pipfile, or some other thing? Sometimes it seems to be accessing the internet, which is altogether unexpected.
Does open open the editor with the virtualenv bin directory prepended to the PATH? Or something else?
install "Installs provided packages". What are "provided packages"? Do they include the ones in my Pipfile? If no arguments are given, it installs "all" packages; which "all" are you talking about: in the Pipfile, Pipfile.lock, current active environment?
Which of these commands modify my environment? Which modify my Pipfile? Which modify my Pipfile.lock?
Could the cli help text and documentation clear this up, please?
Thank you for all your work on pipenv.
