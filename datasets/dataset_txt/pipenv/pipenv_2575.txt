I run linux Mint and running "pip install pipenv" fails with this error
"""
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pipenv/core.py", line 11, in
import _pipfile as pipfile
ImportError: No module named _pipfile
"""
I had to manually copy the _pipfile directory to my dist-packages/pipenv/ for it to work
Has anyone else experienced this too?
