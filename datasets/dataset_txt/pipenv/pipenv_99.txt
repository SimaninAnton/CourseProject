I'm using pipenv version 2018.11.26, and running pipenv check returns the following:
Checking PEP 508 requirements…
Passed!
Checking installed package safety…
An error occurred:
Unable to load vulnerability database
It seems that this has happened in the past -- I did some googling and stumbled across this old issue: #3826
When I first started noticing the error, https://pyup.io/ was returning HTTP 500 for their homepage. But now it's back up and running, and pipenv is still giving errors. pipenv check --verbose doesn't show any extra information, so I'm not sure what's wrong.
On another note, might it be possible to add a flag to pipenv check to only do the PEP 508 checks and skip the security checks for times like this?
