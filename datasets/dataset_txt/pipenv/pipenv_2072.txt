I am looking for a way to pass the name of the .env file for pipenv to load automatically when running pipenv shell or pipenv run. The use-case here is multiple environments, e.g. when running in development I have different database credentials than production.
I am envisioning having .env-prod and .env-dev and passing those as args to pipenv run --env=.env-prod <args>
And have that passed instead of the hardcoded .env
