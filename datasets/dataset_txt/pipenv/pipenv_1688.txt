The virtualenv name suffix is insufficiently random. A removed directory that is re-created will obtain "ownership" of the virtualenv that was created for the prior project of the same directory.
Describe your environment
Debian 9
Python 3.6
Pipenv 9.0.1
Expected result
A sufficiently randomized virtualenv suffix for every virtualenv created
Actual result
Steps to replicate

cd something
