I'm using Visual Studio Code as an IDE in Windows. When I open an integrated terminal in vscode, it loads cmd in the root of the current project. I then type pipenv shell to load that project's environment before doing other terminal-ly things.
I would like to go directly to the pipenv shell when opening a terminal within a project, without having to type this command. My options are either:
Paste a different .exe path in this option, and add the shell argument as an argument
// The path of the shell that the terminal uses on Windows. When using shells shipped with Windows (cmd, PowerShell or Bash on Ubuntu).
"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"
Add where to load whatever Windows environment variables get loaded by the pipenv shell command here
// Object with environment variables that will be added to the VS Code process to be used by the terminal on Windows```
My question is where could I find either... value to input?
