When trying to pipenv lock on project with (too) many dependencies (>300), pipenv crashes.
Describe your environment
osx
Python version: 3.6
Pipenv version: 9.0.3
Expected result
pipenv creates lock file.
Actual result
pipenv crashes with:
OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files: '/var/folders/4h/s6ttpgkd1d1ddm85n3n5kw4w0000gn/T/pipenv-m5smono2-requirement.txt'
Steps to replicate
Pifple with over 253 dependencies.
Run any command that would produce the lock file (eg: pipenv lock)
