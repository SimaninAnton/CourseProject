If I set a particular environment variable (in this case ORACLE_HOME) in both my .bashrc and the project's .env, the .bashrc value will take precedence, even inside pipenv shell. (Apparently .env doesn't even get run with pipenv install?)
Expected result
The value of an environmental variable set in a project's .env file would take precedence over the value of the same variable set in the user's .bashrc.
Actual result
The value of an environmental variable set in the user's .bashrc file takes precedence over the value of the same variable set in a project's .env.
Steps to replicate
Set ORACLE_HOME to one value in your user's .bashrc (probably using export).
Set ORACLE_HOME to another value in your project's .env.
Run pipenv run echo $ORACLE_HOME and note the value.
