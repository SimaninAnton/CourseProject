Some python packages aren't pip installable. For example, to use PyGObject in Linux, normally you have to either have to create the virtualenv with the --system-site-packages option, manually create the symbolic links between the virtualenv and the distribution installed packages, or use another external python package like vext that attempts to automate this for you (I haven't had much success with this option). It would be great if pipenv supported a --system-site-packages type option. It would be even better if we could find a better way to automate usage of these types of libraries, because having to use --system-site-packages is still a pain point especially if you want to setup a pipeline to automate testing.
