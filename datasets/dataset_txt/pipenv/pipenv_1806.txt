Hello.
I had an issue yesterday with an invalid version of my package being installed with pipenv install --dev, using editable line such as:
"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
Even by cleaning everything, an old commit was used instead.
I fixed it by entering the egg name of my package in Pipfile:
mypackage = {path = ".", editable = true}
An, I find it more elegant instead of this sha-1-like name, to use the package name. It is more logic, since it is editable, there is no need to freeze a hash whatsoever.
What do you think of it?
I have opened a suggestion here: pipfile#94
