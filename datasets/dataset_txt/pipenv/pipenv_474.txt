Issue description
Currently pipenv with latest requirementslib will output pipenv lock -r as followings. But actually index in line such as flask==1.0.2 -i https://pypi.org/simple is not working for pip install -r requirements.txt. Only the top line -i https://pypi.org/simple works.
So probably it is redundant to add sources per-line?
pipenv lock -r
-i https://pypi.org/simple
click==7.0 -i https://pypi.org/simple
flask==1.0.2 -i https://pypi.org/simple
itsdangerous==1.1.0 -i https://pypi.org/simple
jinja2==2.10 -i https://pypi.org/simple
markupsafe==1.1.0 -i https://pypi.org/simple
werkzeug==0.14.1 -i https://pypi.org/simple
Please run $ pipenv --support, and paste the results here. Don't put backticks (`) around it! The output already contains Markdown formatting.
