Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I was frustrated while starting to work with pipenv by the documentation structure. Until I figured out how to navigate pipenv docs I felt like child in a fog. I felt lost in the amount of the information. Couldn't find things that I needed.
Here are some things that bothers me while working with pipenv docs:
Sidebar is bloated and mostly has links to other projects, not focusing on the main topic: providing info about how does pipenv work.
Sidebar doesn't have a full Table of Contents - only current page contents is on sidebar Table of Contents
Installation instructions not in Table of Contents.
Pages are to big, for example: advanced that's a lot of stuff in here.
Full description of CLI usage is on title page.
Describe the solution you'd like
Just negate things I mentioned above and I'll be happy :D But just for the record:
Sidebar is free of distractions.
Sidebar concisely list's Table Of Contents with current page contents unfold.
Single source of true for Table Of Contents.
CLI usage help has its own separate page.
Additional context
I would like to bring other project documentation here: Mitogen. Its sidebar is so helpful - contains full TOC - it's so easy to navigate. This is what we should pursue.
