As described in this StackOverflow question, I'm trying to use pipenv together with pyenv to specify a certain version of Python. However, when I run pipenv shell, it runs with my system version of Python and not the one I specified using the pyenv local command.
Are pipenv and pyenv not compatible with each other?
