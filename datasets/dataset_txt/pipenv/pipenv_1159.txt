Expected result
pipenv should be usable with direnv, i.e. like minikube does:
eval "$(minikube docker-env --shell bash)"
the shell parameter exactly does what i would expect for pipenv.
Actual result
internally, direnv uses bash spawn to do it's work, and will pass the changes to the actual shell.
therefore, using direnv in conjunction with fish shell will always detect fish as shell.
as the syntax is not compatible, this will fail.
Steps to replicate
use direnv
have eval "$(pipenv --completion)" in .envrc
issue direnv allow
