Issue description
pipenv install psycopg2 failed, even though the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files included the entries and hashes for packages.
Also I noticed that pip install psycopg2 also failed: https://gist.github.com/ye/bf1198cc15d9a6a177bae8bc0fc0aff9#file-pip-install-psycopg2-log
Also after the pip install failure, the pip inside pipenv virtual environment is borked.
$ pip -V
