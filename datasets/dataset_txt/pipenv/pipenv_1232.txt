I tried running pipenv shell -c as recommended here and got the following error:
⚡ ~/proj/temp/pipenvtest$ pipenv shell -c
Spawning environment shell (/usr/local/bin/zsh). Use 'exit' to leave.
. /Users/kbd/.local/share/virtualenvs/pipenvtest-4itLjI3S/bin/activate
-c
⚡ ~/proj/temp/pipenvtest$ . /Users/kbd/.local/share/virtualenvs/pipenvtest-4itLjI3S/bin/activate
(pipenvtest-4itLjI3S) ⚡ ~/proj/temp/pipenvtest$ -c
zsh: command not found: -c
It seems to pass anything after shell to the shell inside the virtualenv (which is what this code seems to do), but -c isn't being handled?
