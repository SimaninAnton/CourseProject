$ pipenv --support
This is a general question. I know that venv names are made out of project name (folder name) and slug value. For example for me here it is simple-v0MobB9A.
With venvs created with pipenv==2018.5.18 doing pipenv shell was transforming my prompt into
(note the space after venv name)
(simple-v0MobB9A) machine42 ➜  simple git:(master) ✗
Now after updating to pipenv==2018.10.9 I am getting
(simple)machine42 ➜  simple git:(master) ✗ 
It is awesome that the slug value is skipped, however, the missing space between (simple) and machine42 is bothering me. It's a minor issue (don't know if actual issue or bug?) but I find it aesthetically unpleasant and have no idea where it comes from.
