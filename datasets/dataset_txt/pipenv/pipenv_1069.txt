Hey, I installed pipenv with brew install pipenv, the version of Python and pipenv are:
Python: 3.6.5
pipenv: 2018.5.18
But now I can only create one virtualenv with python:3.6.5, no matter where I am:
~
•100% ➜ cd hello

~/hello
•100% ➜ pipenv --three

The two projects' virtualenv path are the same: /Users/jack/.local/share/virtualenvs/jack-JNXsLa7q.
IMO, the Python virtualenv should be located at:
/Users/jack/.local/share/virtualenvs/hello-JNXsLa7q
/Users/jack/.local/share/virtualenvs/world-JNXsLa7q
based on the video instructor at https://docs.pipenv.org/
But they all use the home folder's name, so the Pipfile is located at /Users/jack.
Look forward for your help & reply. :)
