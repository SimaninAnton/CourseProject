Via python_version it is possible to specifiy the exact version of python that shall be used.
But for some Project I need to ensure that only 32bit/64bit Python is used. I.e. if the project uses specific DLLs.
The windows launcher of python allows to specifiy the exact python interpreter by adding "-32" or "-64" to the version. I.e. python_version = "3.6-32". It would be nice if pipenv allows the same interpreter selection.
Alternatively an additional setting in the Pipfile could solve the issue.
