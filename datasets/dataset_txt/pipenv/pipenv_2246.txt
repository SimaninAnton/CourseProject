I don't know if this is feasibly debuggable, or if this is even a bug.
I run pipenv to get its help page, and it takes a surprisingly long time to show output. Here's the results of one time pipenv. Multiple runs gave similar results.
pipenv 0.79s user 0.12s system 99% cpu 0.912 total
Seems like it should be instantaneous to run what's essentially a help page.
