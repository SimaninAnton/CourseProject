The extra index is definitely available, as the desired package is installed when running pipenv install --skip-lock. However, I cannot generate a lockfile by running pipenv install or pipenv lock. This was not true earlier today and I have not updated pipenv or anything else relevant to my knowledge.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Pipenv version: 9.0.1
Expected result
Lockfile is generated when running pipenv lock.
Actual result
$ pipenv lock --clear --verbose

Steps to replicate
Unfortunately I can't provide replication since the extra index requires credentials I cannot distribute publicly. But my steps are as follows:
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv lock --clear --verbose
The toy project contains only two files:
.env:
PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://[elided]@packagecloud.io/[elided]/pypi/simple
Pipfile:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[packages]

get-app-root-path = "*"


[requires]

python_version = "3.6"
