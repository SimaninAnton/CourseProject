Try this:
cd ~/project
pipenv install foo
pipenv shell
# ... do some work with virtualenv activated ...
cd ~/sandbox
pipenv install bar
This creates a new virtualenv, installs bar and creates Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in ~/sandbox/ when I expected it to be in the activated virtualenv and bar to be included in ~/project/Pipfile and ~/project/Pipfile.lock.
As far as I can understand I dunno if it's a bug or a feature. But this seems strange to me. Thanks for pipenv !
