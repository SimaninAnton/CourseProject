I've been following the project. And I saw that he now supports pyenv.
I did not understand how to make them work together. I use pyenv a long time.
I tested the lines added in the lasts commit.
$ py -c "import os; print (bool (os.environ.get ('PYENV_SHELL')) or bool (os.environ.get ('PYENV_ROOT')))"

True # Exit the shell
What should I do to make it work?
Thanks in advance for the help
