Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!).
Describe the issue briefly here.
installing incompatible packages on purpose. azure 2.00 wants azure-mgmt-compute ~1.0.0, but we need 3.0.1. so far works for us using just pip
This works fine:
pipenv install --skip-lock azure==2.0.0 azure-mgmt-compute==3.0.1
However, if we want to recreate the virtualenv from scratch and use the Pipfile generated by the above command, the result is that we have both 1.0.0 and 3.0.1 of azure-mgmt-compute installed in site-packages. I can verify this by looking at ..../site-packages/azure/mgmt/compute/. If there is another computer dir under that, then 1.0.0 is installed. If compute_management_client.py is there, then 3.0.1 is installed. It seems though that 1.0.0 is active because of the errors we get when running our code.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
If you're on MacOS, just run the following:
$ python -m pipenv.help | pbcopy
error running this on my Mac:
