Now that pipenv update it's gone, I'm not really sure how can I update packages locally.
Describe your environment
MacOSX 10.13
Python version: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: 10.0.0
Expected result
$ pipenv run pip list --outdated
Package       Version Latest Type
------------- ------- ------ -----
boto3         1.5.35  1.6.1  wheel
botocore      1.8.49  1.9.1  wheel
flake8-quotes 0.13.1  0.14.0 sdist
SQLAlchemy    1.1.17  1.2.4  sdist
tqdm          4.19.5  4.19.6 wheel

$ pipenv sync --dev
[...]

$ pipenv run pip list --outdated
Nothing outdated
Actual result
I also tried with pipenv install --dev but I'm not really sure how to update packages.
The content of my Pipfile is something like this:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[packages]

"psycopg2" = "*"

[dev-packages]

pytest = "*"

[requires]

python_full_version = "3.6.4"
with all other packages listed as "*"
