I don't understand what the Pipfile.lock file actually does.
I can see that it stores the hashes of the installed versions, and I can see that from that I can create a pinned requirements.txt file to use with pip.
But I don't see what it prevents from happening, if you don't use pip and only use pipenv.
There's mention of how it can be used to deploy to production, but an example would be great.
If some kind soul could explain what the "dev -> deploy to production" workflow is supposed to be here, I'd happily turn it into a Pull Request for the documentation.
P.S. Thanks for this, @kennethreitz , I love the graph and secure options...
