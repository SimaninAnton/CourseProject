Any suggestion if the editable package is located outside of the current application?
Let's assume you have this folder structure
/application
-- Dockerfile
-- Pipfile
-- Pipfile.lock
/lib1 # local python package
and I want to install local editable package lib1. My entry in the Pipfile looks like:
lib1 = {path = "./../lib1",editable = true}
And my Dockerfile looks like:
RUN pipenv install --system --deploy
Running cd application && docker build . is failing with the following error:
ValueError: Invalid path './../lib1'
What is the recommended solution here?
