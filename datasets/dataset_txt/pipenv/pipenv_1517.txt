Hello
Can we imagine a "--user" option for "pipenv install", that would allow a content of a Pipfile/Lock to be installed into the ~/.local directory of the user? Pip provides this option, and is used by pipenv to update itself.
I should not be the "normal" way of using pipenv, but since there is a "--system" that install on the system (requiring sudo permission), a similar "--user" can be useful.
I am looking for this option especially for embedded the application inside a docker image, most of a time it is fine to recreate a virtualenv inside the docker (it is still better than using "--system" even from inside a docker), but sometimes we want the application directly callable by the docker user.
thanks
