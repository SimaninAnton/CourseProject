Issue description
I have installed the apache-airflow version 1.10.6 using pip inside the pipenv shell.
My AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable is set to ~/airflow (by default) and I want to change this path to my desired path. (to this directory containing Pipfile).
For this, I created a .env file and mentioned all environment variables and their paths that must be set each time I am inside pipenv. It successfully sets all those ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES as set in .env except the AIRFLOW_HOME variable.
For now, I have to manually run source .env to set the AIRFLOW_HOME variable to the desired path
Expected result
echo $AIRFLOW_HOME
/home/varun/Desktop/airflow
Actual result
echo $AIRFLOW_HOME
/home/varun/airflow
Here is the .env file
AIRFLOW_HOME=/home/varun/Desktop/airflow
PYTHONPATH=/home/varun/Desktop/:/home/varun/Desktop/Airflow-Start/examples/
Here is the output from pipenv --support
$ pipenv --support
