Be sure to check the existing issues, both open and closed.
Describe the issue briefly here.
Describe your environment
Linux
Python version: 3.6.4 and 2.7.9
Pipenv version: 11.10.0
Expected result
I expected the wtforms package contents to be correct.
Actual result
It appears the wtforms package contents was the latest version overridden by the specified version.
Steps to replicate
This is easiest to replicate with docker where the environment is clean:
docker run -it --rm python bash

pip install pipenv==11.10.0

export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1

# Test python3
mkdir /test-python3 && cd /test-python3
pipenv install --three wtforms==1.0.5

# Notice files line up with wtforms==1.0.5
# (https://pypi.python.org/packages/fb/9d/9dcdb7a9a19301c0cc04eca1aa8c60da50d97156f3c10e24519eb77202e1/WTForms-1.0.5.zip)
ls -la .venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wtforms/

# Test python2
mkdir /test-python2 && cd /test-python2
pipenv install --two wtforms==1.0.5

# Notice it appears the files from wtforms==2.1
# (https://pypi.python.org/packages/bf/91/2e553b86c55e9cf2f33265de50e052441fb753af46f5f20477fe9c61280e/WTForms-2.1.zip)
# were overriden by the files from wtforms==1.0.5
