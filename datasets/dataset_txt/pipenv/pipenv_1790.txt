Given the following file:
import os

print(os.environ.get('VIRTUAL_ENV'))
pipenv run python test.py will result in printing None.
I discovered this bug while trying to install venvgit2 inside of pipenv, which relies on having $VIRTUAL_ENV available inside of its setup.py.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Debian Stretch
Python version: Python 3.5.3
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 8.3.2
Expected result
$VIRTUAL_ENV is present when running scripts from pipenv.
venvgit2 correctly installs.
Actual result
$VIRTUAL_ENV is not present.
Steps to replicate
Already provided.
