I'd like to see the following changes to improve the usability of the documentation:
Add a search box site wide.
Fix search results to use the proper URL. For example: https://docs.pipenv.org/search.html?q=virtualenv shows the resulting URL for the first link as http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/index.html?highlight=virtualenv but it should be https://docs.pipenv.org/index.html?highlight=virtualenv
Provide some navigational context where users know where they are in the docs through either a left sidebar, breadcrumbs, Next and Previous links, or both.
Use a theme that is consistent with the PyPA which includes all these features out of the box.
Thank you for your consideration.
