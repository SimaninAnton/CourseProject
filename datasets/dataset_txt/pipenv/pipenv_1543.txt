You have the latest version of a dependency that's on an index like PyPI installed using pipenv install dep.
You import dep, and check dep.__file__ and it returns something along the lines of '/users/<user>/.virtualenvs/madness-HMebEsp1/Lib/site-packages/dep', which is good.
You want to use dep with some custom features, so you clone it onto your disk and use pipenv install -e /path/to/local/dep to play with it.
You import dep and dep.__file__ and you get path/to/local/dep/dep/__init__.py which makes you happy. The Pipefile now has: "8c9b980" = {path = "path/to/local/dep", editable = true} added to it.
You want to revert back to using the PyPI version because you gave up on your feature, so you uninstall it using pipenv uninstall '<hash>' , where <hash> is 8c9b980.
You import dep and dep.__file__ and you STILL get path/to/local/dep/dep/__init__.py, even though "8c9b980" = {path = "path/to/local/dep", editable = true} has been removed from the Pipefiles. This makes you sad .
... or should it? is this by design? Am I missing something about how these editable installs are supposed to be used?
Describe your environment
OS Type windows
Python version: $ python -V 2.7.12
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 9.0.3
Expected result
to see dep.__file__ return something like '/users/<user>/.virtualenvs/madness-HMebEsp1/Lib/site-packages/dep just like it did before the local editable version was installed.
