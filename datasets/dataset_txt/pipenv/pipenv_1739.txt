More than I issue is a question: is this https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/d122401869391db4c42fd32cc5020861b8c8cd0a/pipenv/project.py#L131 the only way the virtualenv name is generated? Is there the possibility to specify the name from the command line? If not, it's a missing feature or rather a defined choice (to have it projectname+hash) ?
Thank you so much, cheers.
p.s: if there is a better place where to ask these questions, please let me know. I'd rather ask in the proper place :)
