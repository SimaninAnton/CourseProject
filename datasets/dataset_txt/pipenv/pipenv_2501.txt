I was kind of confused that pipenv uninstall does not change the Pipfile at all. I'd expect that if the pipenv uninstall requests command removes the requests entry from the Pipfile then pipenv uninstall would do, too.
I'm aware that you might never want to remove all your dependencies from the Pipfile. However, a command like pipenv clean would be much more appropriate in my opinion to clean the environment.
I'd love to see that the packages argument for pipenv uninstall would be required and a separate pipenv clean command would exist.
