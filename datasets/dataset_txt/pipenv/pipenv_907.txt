When I install a local package with pipenv, the entry in the Pipfile and the lock file is a short hash instead of the package name. Is there a reason why that happens? And is there anyway to make it use the package name instead?
The issue with that is uninstalling with package name leaves the Pipfile and lock file unchanged. The hash entry remains.
I am installing from local because the package is in a monorepo, and did not want to create it as a package in pypi.
