I have a problem with pipenv, when building in different platforms (machine). As you can see in the uploaded Pipfile.zip I have specified some packages to be install in the virtual enviroment. The imageio package doesn't support the raspberry pi yet.
I tried to exclude it in Pipfile using:
imageio = {version = "*", platform_machine = "!= 'armv7l'"}
Even with that directive if I try to install to my raspberry pi, the pipenv hangs!!!
Describe your environment
Raspbian: Linux *** 4.9.59-v7+ #1047 SMP Sun Oct 29 12:19:23 GMT 2017 armv7l GNU/Linux
Python version: Python 3.5.3
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.1
Expected result
I expected to install all the packages except the imageio package.
Actual result
I hangs! Some how it misses some packages and hangs around numpy package! I tried to get the logs here:
pipenv_log.zip
Any Ideas?
