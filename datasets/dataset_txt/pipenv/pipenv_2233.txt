There are occasions where a pip editable install from a git repo will ask for input. This causes pipenv install to fail with the following.
No package provided, installing all dependencies.
Pipfile found at /home/jsatt/dev/summit/summit-knowledge/Pipfile. Considering this to be the project home.
Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock...

Steps to recreate:
Add and install git editable repos dependency Pipfile (how every you want to, mine was installed via requirements file before)
Edit Pipfile to change case of any characters in repo url (pipenv convert from requirements file lower cased all my repo urls)
pipenv install, this should fail with the output above.
Expected behavior:
There's a couple possible expected since the command is looking for user input. Could provide a reasonable default for various types of input requests. Could be some why of allowing the user to prove input for their choice.
