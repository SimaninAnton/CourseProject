It's not clear to me why pipenv lock is a separate command that the user must remember to invoke. This introduces something easily forgettable into the pipenv workflow which can ultimately lead to, say, committing but forgetting to add your dependencies (which is a pitfall already true of normal pip/virtualenv workflows).
It would be great to have the lockfile automatically regenerated on pipenv install and pipenv uninstall. This brings pipenv more in line with tools like Yarn and Bundler, which make it hard to get your dependency info into an inaccurate state.
E.g. running yarn add underscore will both insert underscore into package.json and add a locked version to yarn.lock. I think it's natural that pipenv install requests should add requests to the Pipfile and the new locked versions to Pipfile.lock.
