Issue description
Install mercurial repo as user into his current pipenv:
Expected result
pipenv installs the package of the hg repo into current pipenv.
Actual result
pipenv tries to install the package of the hg repo into global site-packages.
Error: An error occurred while installing hg+https://user@bitbucket.org/user/myrepo/#egg=myrepo!
Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/myrepo-0.0.1.dist-info'
Consider using the --user option or check the permissions.
When possible, provide the verbose output (--verbose), especially for locking and dependencies resolving issues.
Steps to replicate
cd ~/my_project
rm Pipfile
sudo -uhttp pipenv install "hg+https://user@bitbucket.org/user/myrepo/#egg=myrepo"
$ pipenv --support
