[packages]
requests = {git = "https://github.com/requests/requests", editable = true}
Here is the output.
➜  pipenv lock

It is because there are two seprate venv_resolve_deps process (one for normal packages
pipenv/pipenv/core.py

 results = venv_resolve_deps( 
, one for editable packages in
pipenv/pipenv/core.py
Line 1059 in 707cca9
 vcs_results = venv_resolve_deps( 
) which will both calling spinner and finally output the success! message.
Besides, It also takes a while for get_vcs_deps to process. But there is no spinner for this method and this makes gap which has not status in shell at all between two get_vcs_deps processes
