Issue description
When using an existing virtualenv, we get this message:
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1 to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead. You can set PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1 to suppress this warning.
Expected result
With export PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1 the Courtesy Notice message should not be shown.
Actual result
The message still appear with export PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1.
