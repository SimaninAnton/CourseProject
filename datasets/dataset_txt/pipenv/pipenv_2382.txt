On macOS with python and python3 installed, pipenv hangs with this Pipefile:
[packages]
awacs = "*"
awscli = "*"
aws-shell = "*"
botocore = "*"
jetstream = "*"
mycli = "*"
sops = "*"
troposphere = "*"
troposphere-cli = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
Here's what it shows:
$ pipenv install --three
