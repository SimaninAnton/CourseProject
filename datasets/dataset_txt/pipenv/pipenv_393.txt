Pipenv version 2018.11.26 on Windows 10.
Issue description
When installing from a private git repository the prompts for entering username and password appear to be hidden due to the "Installing" animation.
[Edit] I am able to enter username and password by assuming when it is asking me, pasting in the values, and hitting enter. The same animation overwrite behavior is then seen at the "Pinning VCS Packages..." animation.
Expected result
When running,
pipenv install -e git+https://git-private-repo@v0.2.0#egg=private-project
I expect to be prompted for my username and password.
Actual result
There are no visible prompts.
Console output:
$ pipenv install -e git+https://git-private-repo@v0.2.0#egg=private-project --verbose
Installing -e git+https://git-private-repo@v0.2.0#egg=private-project… 
[    ] Installing...Installing 'private-project'
$ ['C:\\Users\\user\\.virtualenvs\\env-l1hpaNfS\\Scripts\\pip.exe', 'install', '--src', 'C:\\Users\\user\\.virtualenvs\\env-l1hpaNfS\\src', '--verbose', '--upgrade', '-e', 'git+https://git-private-repo@v0.2.0#egg=private-project', '-i', 'https://pypi.org/simple']
[=== ] Installing...
At this point the prompts for entering my username and password are being overwritten by the installing animation. If I hit enter at this point I can see the enter username/password prompts flash onto the screen, so they are there, just hidden.
Steps to replicate
Install from a private repo without using environment variables for username/password.
