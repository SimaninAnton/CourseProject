Using 7.2.1 and this Pipfile:
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[requires]

python_version = "3.6"

[packages]

testpackage = "*"
Installation with a full Python path works:
$ pipenv install --python=C:\\Python36\\python.exe
Creating a virtualenv for this project…
Using C:\Python36\python.exe to create virtualenv…
Running virtualenv with interpreter C:\Python36\python.exe
Using base prefix 'C:\\Python36'
New python executable in C:\projects\template-python-demo\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
But pipenv is unable to locate Python otherwise despite it being installed in the normal location (on AppVeyor):
$ pipenv install
Warning: Python 3.6 was not found on your system…
You can specify specific versions of Python with:
  $ pipenv --python path\to\python
Is pipenv able to locate Pythons on Windows? Having this feature work would mean that build scripts no longer need to workaround the Windows case and can get rid of hardcoded paths.
