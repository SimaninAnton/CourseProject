This is something you can do with virtualenv and pip. pipenv is just missing the main.py file to do so.
python3.6 -m venv anenv
. ./anenv/bin/activate
python -m pip install pygame
However pipenv can't run as a module.
$ python3.6 -m pipenv install
/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.6: No module named pipenv.__main__; 'pipenv' is a package and cannot be directly executed
This is useful for running the script with different python interpreters in build scripts and such which use different python versions, or on different platforms where things like "pip3.6" do not exist.
