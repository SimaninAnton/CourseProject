Describe your environment
OS Type macOS
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 9.1.0 (aka master)
Expected result
Setting PIP_INDEX_URL creates a Pipfile with a [[source]] set to the contents.
Actual result
Pipfile contains both the default section pointing to "https://pypi.python.org/pypi" and a section with my settings.
Steps to replicate
Since I don’t know a public PyPI index, let’s do a simpler thing:
env PIP_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.python.org/pypi pipenv install requests
results in
[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/pypi"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"


[[source]]

url = "https://pypi.python.org/pypi"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
If they were different, the correct one would be at the first place.
