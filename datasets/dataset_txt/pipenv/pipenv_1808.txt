I think Pipenv is great, but am confused on the state of things. A single, comprehensive, canonical source of information on the topic would be extremely helpful (preferably not under someone's personal github account).
This git repo (Pipenv) claims it is the official packaging tool for Python
Pipenv â€” the officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org, free (as in freedom).
Yet it's stored under the @kennethreitz git user. This seems odd. Why not under the Python Packaging Authority github user @pypa or Python @python?
The Python Packaging Authority has this to say about Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
WARNING: This project is under active design and development. Nothing is set in stone at this point of time.
This repository contains the design specification of the Pipfile format, as well as (soon) an implementation of a parser for the specification which can be used by pip and any other consumer (e.g. Pipenv), once the design (including the form of a Pipfile itself) has been built out and finalized.
So it seems a surprising that the officially recommended tool is "under active design an development" and that "nothing is set in stone at this time". Is this still accurate? Is it intentional that Pipenv be distributed to thousands or millions of machines if it's still in beta?
