I've been using it via the pew package, which fills roughly the same niche as virtualenvwrapper, but using the inve approach. My own experience finds it vastly superior to the script-sourcing approach. Explained simply, it starts a subshell instead of changing the current shell. That means de-activating an environment is as simple as the standard exit command in your shell.
