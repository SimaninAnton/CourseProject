Reading the code while working on a PR (#1008), I was trying to write a test and realized that Project.create_pipfile() forces the name to Pipfile instead of relying on the clever Project.pipfile_location() property. There is no reason as far as I can tell but I might be missing something as I'm still a bit new on this project.
