What is the best practice for using pipenv with Continuous Integration systems (specifically, with Heroku CI)? Currently I have testing dependencies in my dev-packages but that doesn't load when using Heroku CI, so I have to include all dev stuff in my default (ie, production.) list. Is there a [test] header? Some other practice?
