While working on several PRs to this project I have tried to run tests as described in CONTRIBUTING.rst and .travis.yml.
And some of them were constantly failing. I tried all possible things like:
setting and removing PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS
uninstalling pipenv from my computer completely
starting everything from scratch several times
Still no luck.
@techalchemy helped me with this task, we both did not succeed.
We discussed in #1394 that this should be a separate issue.
Describe your environment
OS Type, macos 10.11.6
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 9.0.3,
master was at https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/tree/4f2295a1dbf7fe6fa36ef4ec92b758acf60e1710
Expected result
I expect tests to be run successfully.
Actual result
Since the output is rather verbose I have created a gist: https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/e9f72d535c1eae52ab441c0c940a0f2e
Steps to replicate
I have followed the same steps as we do in CONTRIBUTING.rst: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/4f2295a1dbf7fe6fa36ef4ec92b758acf60e1710/CONTRIBUTING.rst
