I'm attempting to install specific versions of packages in a pipenv and have different versions of those same packages on my host environment from local whl files. When I attempt to do any thing like run "pipenv shell" or "pipenv install [package_name].whl", I get an error stating that the encryption package needs to be at least version 2.1.4. The error is below. Does pipenv require this version specifically? If so, why did it not get automatically updated as a dependency?
Using the following versions:
Python 2.7.13
Pip 9.0.1
pipenv 11.8.0
cryptography 2.1.1
The error I get when executing "pipenv shell":
