Install process fails when the version string is not in the typical x.y.z format. To be exact the installation succeeds but the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are not getting updated.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
'pipenv install beeware' installs the requested packages
Actual result
The process fails with:
truncated 'pipenv install beeware' output

As you can see above the exact version (and newer versions too are available). The 'toga' and 'beeware' packages end up being installed though:

'pipenv graph' output

python REPL output
Steps to replicate
run 'pipenv install beeware' in an empty directory
