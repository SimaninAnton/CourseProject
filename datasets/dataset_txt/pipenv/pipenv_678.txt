I get the pipenv/patched/
but why O why are you patching a module that This repository has been archived by the owner. It is now read-only.
This means the version of crayons available to us mere mortals is broken as far as using it with pipenv.
Also ask the question why are you using it if it is archived.
Q what is pipenv's suggestion for producing coloured text in a terminal.
many thanks
