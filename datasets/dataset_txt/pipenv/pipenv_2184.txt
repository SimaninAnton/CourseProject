On a Mac, when running pipenv run python, the following error occurs
pipenv run python -V
Warning: There was an unexpected error while activating your virtualenv. Continuing anywayâ€¦
Python 3.6.1
It appears to be down to when pipenv is attempting to activate the virtualenv https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/blob/master/pipenv/cli.py#L1549. When printing out the exception message, I get;
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '"/Users/kevinbradwick/.local/share/virtualenvs/nltk-ZIngsREP/bin/activate_this.py"'
The entire path is quoted in double quotes, which of course, is not part of the path hence it failing to open.
