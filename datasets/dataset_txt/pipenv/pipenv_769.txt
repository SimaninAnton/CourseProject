Thanks for the great work!
I'd like to use a private pypi repo as described in https://docs.pipenv.org/advanced/#specifying-package-indexes. Is there a way to specify a client-cert and CA for this pypi repo? The corresponding pip call would be pip install --cert <path> --client-cert <path> package.
Is this possible? if not, would you be interested in a PR?
$ pipenv --support
