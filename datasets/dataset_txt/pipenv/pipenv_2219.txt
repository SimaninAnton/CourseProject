When we pip install then pip freeze an editable vcs requirement, the frozen requirements include all dependencies and the sha of the editable requirements.
With pipenv the dependencies of editable vcs requirements do not appear in Pipfile.lock, nor the sha of the installed version.
$ pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/sbidoul/subdirtest.git#egg=subdirtest\&subdirectory=setup
...
$ cat Pipfile.lock
...
    "default": {
        "subdirtest": {
            "editable": true,
            "git": "https://github.com/sbidoul/subdirtest.git",
            "subdirectory": "setup"
        }
    },
...
$ pipenv run pip freeze
click==6.7
pkg-resources==0.0.0
-e git+https://github.com/sbidoul/subdirtest.git@7b18afe980a42bfe8d1a96b5ed52e05f58d9ef6c#egg=subdirtest&subdirectory=setup
Since the installed package depends on click I expect to see it in the locked dependencies.
I also expect to see the sha of the installed subdirtest in Pipfile.lock.
Is it a missing feature in pipenv? (perhaps I misunderstand something)
