It would be great to be able to force an ignore of a mismatch in package dependencies. At present you can't lock a configuration which has has a mismatch, even if the code works properly.
Describe your environment
OS Type: OSX
Python version: 3.6.3
Pipenv version: 9.0
Expected result
I would like to be able to run pipenv lock --ignore-mismatch to create a lockfile which ignores a mismatch generated in version dependencies. Some unhelpful packages include a maximum version in their install_requires, even though the version they're preventing you from working with doesn't exist yet.
Example
django-babel specifies a requirement for Django<1.12. The code works absolutely fine with Django 2.0, so this restriction is not relevant. At present the following sequence of commands will fail, and there's no way I can find to generate a lock file to solve it.
pipenv install django-babel
pipenv install "Django>=2.0"
