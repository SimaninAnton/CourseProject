Issue description
PYTHONPATH does not contain the current directory when using pipenv run
Expected result
When running something using run, for example tests
pipenv run pytest tests/
The PYTHONPATH / sys.path should contain the current directory so that packages containing modules to be tested can be found.
Actual result
I get errors like
E ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hello'
And doing
pipenv run python
import sys
print(sys.path)
Shows that the directory the command was executed from is not in the path.
Steps to replicate
Execute these commands in the root dir of a project using pipenv:
pipenv run python
import sys
print(sys.path)
