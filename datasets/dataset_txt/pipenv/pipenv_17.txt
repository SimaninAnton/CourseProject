Summary:
$ pipenv --support
Issue: Trying to initiate dependency management running on bash.exe (git-bash) and end up with some issues...
$ pipenv shell                                                                                       
Warning: Python 2.7 was not found on your system…
You can specify specific versions of Python with:
  $ pipenv --python path\to\python
Note: pipenv install django end up with same error.
