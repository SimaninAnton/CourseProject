I ran:
$ mkdir test
$ cd test
$ pipenv install requests
but this caused the following error:
ERROR: ERROR: Could not find a version that matches requests
No versions found
Was https://pypi.org/simple reachable?
I thought this problem is due to proxy, but the following successfully run.
$ pip install requests
Please help me...
$ pipenv --support
