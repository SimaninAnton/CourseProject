Injecting credentials into Pipfiles via environment variables works as advertised when doing pipenv install. However, it expands and stores the environment variables in both the Pipfile and the Pipfile.lock files when installing a package via pipenv install package-name.
$ python -m pipenv.help output (partial)
Expected result
The environment variables shouldn't be stored in neither the Pipfile nor the Pipfile.lock files.
Actual result
The environment variables are stored in both the Pipfile and the Pipfile.lock files.
Steps to replicate
Add a new private package through pipenv install private-package
$ pipenv install private-package -v output (redacted)
.
See your credentials in both the Pipfile and the Pipfile.lock files.
