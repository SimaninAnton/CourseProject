In a docker build pipeline the same virtualenv is often copied into multiple images. However when pipenv runs on an existing virtualenv (even after I've explicitly erased the Pipfile & Pipfile.lock) it will not report the path of the virtualenv. There are edge cases where multiple environments will be built in .virtualenvs so reporting this pathevery time pipenv install is run is important (at least to me). To be honest it's not even clear to me that the flag works at all.
