I've switched to using pipenv in most projects but got some, what I found to be, unexpected behaviour. I have one project that depends on another and both track their dependencies with pipenv.
The first project (A) had a dependency on numpy = "*" in its Pipfile and in its Pipfile.lock it was using 1.14.
The second project (B) has a dependency on numpy = "==1.13.3" as well as the first project A.
When doing a pip install in project B I would always get numpy 1.14, even when explicity calling pipenv install numpy==1.13.3.
Is this expected behaviour? My understanding of python dependencies is that the dependant specifies source (e.g. pypi.org) and versions.
Also the setup.py in project A just has numpy as a dependency listed (no version requirement).
