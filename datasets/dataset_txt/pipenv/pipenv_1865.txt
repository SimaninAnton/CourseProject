Message from a fan:
I tried using pipenv and after pipenv install requests noticed it used version "*" in the pipfile. I edited that to "2.18.4" to fix it to an exact version but got an error Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies. After googling found that the exact format is supposed to be "==2.18.4".
I found pipenv because I was looking for something like npm or composer for Python, so I thought the version constraints would be similar. Maybe you can show an error when the version constrain format is wrong, or better yet, add it as an alias to the correct one?
I love this idea, and think we should implement it.
