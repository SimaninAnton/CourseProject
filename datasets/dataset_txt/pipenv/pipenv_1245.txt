I'm opening up a new issue to hopefully further the conversation from another closed issue #1579.
pipenv author mentioned when closing the issue above that the issue was with the setup.py for the futures package.
I opened the issue at agronholm/pythonfutures#76 and they are willing to help but we need more info on this side.
Specifically an answer/help to my question here #1579 (comment).
Pipenv and the lock file are amazing so any help getting this resolved will be greatly appreciated!
