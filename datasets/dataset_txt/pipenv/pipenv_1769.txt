Occasionally I want to vendor packages, so with a requirements.txt based workflow, I would have executed pip download -r requirements.txt -d vendor. As far as I can tell, pipenv doesn't have an subcommand to do this. It would be great to have such an option.
Also, in addition it would be cool to choose whether to vendor development packages, or whether to not vendor them.
