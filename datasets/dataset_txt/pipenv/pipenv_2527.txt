Currently there are two issues when having -r foo.txt in a requirements file itself:
relative paths do not work (i.e. with -rbase.txt in requirements/dev.txt pipenv install -r requirements/dev.txt will not find base.txt - for this a temporary os.chdir could work.
a space inbetween -r base.txt will not be handled properly:
Installing -r base.txt...
Error: An error occurred while installing -r base.txt
Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ' base.txt'
(Please note the extra space with the "No such file or directory" error)
It seems like the real fix for this might be to recursively handle -r includes though, instead of passing them as-is to pip_install (and also to the Pipfile) maybe?!
