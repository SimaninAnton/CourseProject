What's the best workflow to use Pipenv with Docker?
I am trying to accomplish this with a Django project running inside Docker / Docker Compose.
Any tips / suggestions / ideas?
P.S. also, I am using https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv to automatically activate my virtualenvs and manage local Pythons. Does that not work well with this toolchain?
