Why not add list command? It should list all required dependencies considering lock file.
I think it is in scope of this package because reading json file is not very pleasing for eye and occupy a lot of space in terminal output. Moreover, I suppose this is assumed to replace pip command in the future, so it should provide all the functionality that vanilla pip does.
