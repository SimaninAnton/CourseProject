Hello,
I am in dire need of the --requirements flag and was wondering why it was removed. Especially after seeing the very recent discussion in #163.
We currently experiment with both pipenv and pip in our development pipeline. Local development is done with pipenv (thanks btw!), but to deploy our servers, we fall back to plain ol' pip. More specifically, we build Docker images from our code. And in those containers there is absolutely no need for virtual environments.
Up until now, we used pipenv install --requirements to generate a requirements.txt file during the build, copy that into the image and used pip to install all requirements.
As long as pip does not support the Pipfile format, I think pipenv should offer some way to export the requirements as a requirements.txt file.
Cheers,
JD
