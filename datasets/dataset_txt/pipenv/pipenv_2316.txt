This is equivalent to the path overrides feature from cargo, rust's package manager. The idea is to be able to override dependency versions from a separate file to the lockfile, which is then not checked into version control.
I have two projects, where one depends on the other via a repository URL + commit hash. However, while developing locally, I would want to use my local copy of the first project.
