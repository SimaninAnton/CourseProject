Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'm always frustrated when I try to update the vendoring script but I'm hit by unrelated issues.
Describe the solution you'd like
This could be solved by having the vendoring script being run as part of the Continues Integration (Travis CI e.g. has daily cron as well).
Describe alternatives you've considered
Prove that the vendoring script is always reproducible.
