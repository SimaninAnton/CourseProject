Sadly the current version of pipenv available in homebrew has broken support for pyenv. While it's possible to install pipenv from master, it would still be a good idea to release a new version as soon as possible. Otherwise you risk that people who try pipenv for the first time might get a misleading first impression. Additionally even seasoned pipenv users suffer from having to do a web search to find a workaround to fix their work environment.
