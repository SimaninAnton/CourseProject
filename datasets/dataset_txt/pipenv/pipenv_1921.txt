Describe you environment
OSX (MAC)
Python version: 2.7.10
Pipenv version: 8.2.6
Issue
setup.py inside invocations repo -> installing CaaS package :
install_requires=[
    'CaaS>=1.0'
  ],

  dependency_links=[
    'https://<private_repo>#egg=CaaS-1.0'
  ],
Installing invocations in a virtualenv
python setup.py install
Valdiating CaaS installed correctly.
(test_1) c4b301cf5d25:invocations quj291$ pip freeze
CaaS==1.0
So far everything works.
Created a Pipfile
[requires]
python_version = '2.7'

[packages]
invocations = { git = 'git://<private-repo>/invocations',  ref = 'master' }
Fails to install invocations because CaaS package cannot be found: pipenv install
Collecting CaaS>=1.0 (from invocations)

  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement CaaS>=1.0 (from invocations) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for CaaS>=1.0 (from invocations)
Tried pipenv install --verbose

Cleaning up...
Tries to get CaaS from pypi instead of private github repo's inside dependency_links of invocation's setup.py
Is this expected? How can I install CaaS package?
Thanks!
