Issue description
in Windows gitbash:
running pipenv shell
starting a python app inside pipenv shell (I used a simple http app)
terminating the app with Crtl + C
typing exit + return to exit pipenv shell
results in a zombie python process
in Windows gitbash:
running pipenv run python myapp (I used a simple http app)
terminating the app and the pipenv run together with Crtl + C
results in a zombie python process
performing the same two workflows in a normal windows cmd:
does not result in a zombie python process
performed the same two workflows with a different simple python flask app generates the exact same result/ behaviour - so, I the problem is probably not what python app is run, but from which shell (gitbash or win cmd).
Expected result
pipenv running in gitbash to not miss to quit python processes, which it started
Actual result
see Issue description
Steps to replicate
