In the doc section on importing from requirements.txt, it says:
Note, that when importing a requirements file, they often have version numbers pinned, which you likely won’t want in your Pipfile, so you’ll have to manually update your Pipfile afterwards to reflect this.
I'd like more explanation about why one wouldn't want pinned version numbers in a Pipfile. Is there a suggested workflow for teams with respect to committing Pipfile.lock (or not)?
