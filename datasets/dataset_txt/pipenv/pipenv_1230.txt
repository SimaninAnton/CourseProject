Per the TOML spec, bare (unquoted) keys can contain ASCII alphanumerics, underscores and dashes â€“ since these are the only characters allowed in Python package names (at least on PyPI), Pipfile shouldn't need to contain any quoted keys.
I tried to check if this was a pytoml or contoml issue; I couldn't get either of them to generate quoted keys with only alphanumerics, so I guess this is an issue with Pipenv? I'll admit I didn't do much testing, so I could be wrong.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Expected result
Pipenv should generate beautiful Pipfiles that look like this, with no quotes (as far as possible):
[dev-packages]
flake8 = "*"
twine = "*"
check-manifest = "*"
pyroma = "*"
flake8-bugbear = "*"
Actual result
Any keys with numbers in are quoted, even though they are allowed to be unquoted.
[dev-packages]
mypy = "*"
"flake8" = "*"
twine = "*"
check-manifest = "*"
pyroma = "*"
"flake8-bugbear" = "*"
Steps to replicate
pipenv install flake8
