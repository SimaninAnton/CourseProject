My current strategy is to add my requirements (generally pinned) to setup.py and then have a requirements.txt file that specifies particular versions.
The workflow I've migrated to is: pipenv install "-e ." and pipenv install "-e .[test]" --dev. Looking at requests's Pipfile this seems to be the same approach, with a couple caveats / notes:
the dev dependencies contains more installation requirements than requests[text]. This is probably fine, as I assume it means you want even more packages installed when developing requests(?).
your dependencies are "-e ." = {extras = ["socks"]}. This appears to be handcoded, as my output looks like: "e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}. Is the first approach better? I.e. should I be manually adding "-e ." = {} to my dependencies?
