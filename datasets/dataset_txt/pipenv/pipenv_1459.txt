pipenv install
throws an error. I also see this doing a variety of other tasks, including pipenv lock. This occurs in multiple projects. I can get rid of the problem by reverting from 11.1.3 to 9.0.1.
I get the same error as #1553, but the error occurs all the time, and I'm not in a virtualenv.
Describe your environment
OS Type MacOS 10.13.1
Python version: $ python -V 3.6.2
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version pipenv, version 11.1.3
Expected result
Not expecting a traceback.
Actual result
~/code/python/scratch/protobufs $ pipenv install
