I'm trying to build a docker image with dependencies installed with pipenv. It fails really weirdly.
My host OS is Debian Stretch, and I'm using the Docker image alpine:3.6.
~ # python3 --version
Python 3.6.1
~ # pipenv --version
pipenv, version 11.0.2
This is the output of my docker build:
Step 10/14 : RUN pipenv install --dev --system --verbose
 ---> Running in d1242c945a25
Pipfile.lock (006157) out of date, updating to (9173ad)…
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies…
ython: not found
I can provide a minimal Pipfile and Dockerfile to reproduce the problem if needed.
