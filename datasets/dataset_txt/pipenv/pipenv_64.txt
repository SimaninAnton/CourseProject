Hello All ,
My systems is macOSX Ver 10.14.6.
My python 3.7.4
When I run pipenv like "pipenv --python 3.7" the env is do created but always in the same place.
and NO PipFile and Pipfile.lock is avail on the local dir.
here what I have done...
I created dir /home/test1/
run "pipenv --python 3.7"
no Pipfile on the /home/test1 dir to be found.
I try to install django and it did install it fine but not on the pipfile on current dir.
I also created /home/test2
run the same as above and the result are the same.
I try to install flask and it did install it fine but not on the same pipfile as above in main home dir.
Any help please.
