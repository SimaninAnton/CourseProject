Hi,
I am trying to sort out how to get Pipenv to fit into my workflow. I am coming from a conda managed environment, so you'd have a "base" virtualenv that was the default python environment, but it is distinct from the system python. I previously installed various python tools into that base, when I wanted them available throughout my system. I'd then create specific virtual environments on a per project basis.
I can easily fit pipenv into the per project part of my workflow, but I'm still trying to figure out how to create the same "base" environment. I am currently using a Pipfile in my home directory and that seems to be a reasonable way to get the benefits of pipenv and have this general python environment.
The one issue I've seen is that if I happen to be in a directory with a Pipfile, pipenv defaults to updating the Pipfile for the current directory vs. the one for the "base" environment.
Is there a better to get the workflow I'm looking for? Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks!
