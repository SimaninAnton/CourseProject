I would like to be able to add a local wheel file to my Pipfile, and be able to emit a requirements.txt that can be installed with pip install -r.
Right now, the Pipfile.lock does not include hashes for local files which means the emitted requirements.txt can't be used as if any hashes are provided all dependencies need hashes.
Describe your environment
MacOS
Python version: Python 3.6.4
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 9.0.3
Expected result
Hashes included for local wheel files in Pipfile.lock and in pipenv lock -r output.
Actual result
No hashes included.
Steps to replicate
pipenv install path/to/some_wheel-py3-none-any.whl
Lock file does not include hashes for some_wheel.
