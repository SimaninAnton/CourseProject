Right now we only have a single way to install development environment: pipenv install --dev.
npm on the other hand has very useful $NODE_ENV variable. So it is possible to change the environment without changing the command itself: npm install.
Right now I have to do a conditional installation in my Dockerfile: RUN pip install pipenv && test "$DJANGO_ENV" == production && pipenv install --system --deploy || pipenv install --dev --system --deploy
I really think it should be simplified.
