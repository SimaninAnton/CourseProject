I'm always frustrated when install/syncs take significant amounts of time when the lockfile hasn't changed. It'd be handy to have this handled automatically.
We can capture last installed/synced Pipfile.lock hash (meta/hash or similar) in virtualenv directory to skip redundant installs/syncs.
Command line parameters, redirecting to other files, and makefile/other infra changes are more time intensive workarounds that require pipenv introspection. Capturing hashes per venv would be a handy universal solution.
