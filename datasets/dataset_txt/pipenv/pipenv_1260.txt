Apologies if this has been suggested before, but I couldn't find it in the existing issues.
Given that pipenv supports subcommands such as pipenv run, pipenv install, ..., the first thing I try when I'm unsure about something is pipenv help. However, this results in an error ('No such command "help".') It always takes a few second to realise that pipenv -h will do the trick but it is a little confusing and results in a mental context switch from the task at hand that would be nice to avoid.
I know that @kennethreitz said in another issue that he wants to keep the list of commands as small as possible, but the help command is arguably one of the most fundamental ones and it is surprising to a user that pipenv help doesn't work while something like pipenv install does.
Suggestion:
Add pipenv help (equivalent to pipenv -h)
Add pipenv help <subcommand> (equivalent to pipenv <subcommand> -h), for instance: pipenv help run
