Checkout the code here and run test.sh with the latest version of pipenv to repro. Dependencies fail to resolve. If you revert to 2018.5.18 it works.
Additional info: moving the same sub-dependencies into the Pipfile directly also allows pipenv to resolve things properly (see the previous commit in the tree).
