Found during a pipenv update against this commit using pipenv 2018.05.18:
$ pipenv lock
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies…
al/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pipenv/resolver.py", line 71, in main
    sources=project.pipfile_sources,
AttributeError: 'Project' object has no attribute 'pipfile_sources'
Revert back to pipenv-11.10.4 did not fixed the issue.
Fixed by reverting to pipenv-11.10.1
I install pipenv using:
pip3 install --user --upgrade 'pipenv==11.10.2'
Summary:
2018.05.18 : failed
11.10.4: failed
11.10.3: failed
11.10.2: failed
11.10.1: work
11.10.0: work
Going back and forth from 11.10.1 to 11.10.2 reproduce this issue, so their have been a change in 11.10.2 that break the pipfile parser.
Maybe it would worth a try to define a "unstable" release channel of pipenv, to avoid breaking change like that that might impact everybody. Are we supposed to use "latest" pipenv or freeze the version of pipenv used in a project? At least early adopters can test these change and general public only get well tested pipenv packages.
