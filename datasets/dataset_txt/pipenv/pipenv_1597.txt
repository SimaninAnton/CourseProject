When running pipenv install the querystringsafe_base64 package gets renamed/normalized to querystringsafe-base64, in the resulting, generated Pipfile.lock file
It can be seen in mozilla/stubattribution-tests@c24d26e
Describe your environment
macOS High Sierra (10.13.4 Beta (17E139j))
Python version: Python 2.7.11 (locally)
Pipenv version: pipenv, version 8.3.2
Expected result
While I'm not sure, I'd expect that querystringsafe_base64 would either be left as-is, or renamed, consistently, to querystringsafe-base64
Actual result
Pipfile.lock has querystringsafe-base64, whereas the Pipfile itself has querystringsafe_base64
Steps to replicate
pipenv install with https://github.com/mozilla/stubattribution-tests/blob/845824793062bc7a2b33faa6ccc2e8a796775932/Pipfile in place
Look at the package-dependency name in both the resulting Pipfile.lock and the original Pipfile, for querystringsafe_base64
