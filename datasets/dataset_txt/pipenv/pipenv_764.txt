Hello,
I have a python project using pipenv and I have several external libraries on it.
I would like to generate a zip file for uploading to AWS Lambda that contains all the dependencies but I can't find the way to do this? Sorry if this is a dumb question but I am quite new to Python and pipenv.
Thanks.
