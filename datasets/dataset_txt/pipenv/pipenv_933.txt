There's a particular CVE that is being raised for our project when running pipenv check that we'd like to ignore. The safety library provides the --ignore argument for this purpose, but the check command doesn't seem to support passing args down to the safety library.
Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like some method for passing arguments down to the safety library, though I don't know what UI would be best. It could involve copying args that safety supports onto check. Or an argument on check like safety-args that'll group a string under a single argument to be expanded and passed down.
Another solution could be environment variables SAFETY_IGNORE for example, but the underlying library does not support that as a variable, so it'd have to be collected and passed down anyway.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Running safety directly and bypassing pipenv check, but that's not a nice alternative.
