I have tried to define two sources in Pipfile, something like this:
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[[source]]
url = "https://myprivatepypi.com/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "internal"

[requires]
python_version = "2.7"

[dev-packages]
"coverage" = {version="*", index="pypi"}

[packages]
"my-private-package" = {version="*", index="internal"}
However, when I try pipenv install I run into an error, which includes a 404, saying that pipenv is looking for 'my-private-package' in https://pypi.python.org/simple.

Seems like the code might just be grabbing the first source in the Pipfile?
