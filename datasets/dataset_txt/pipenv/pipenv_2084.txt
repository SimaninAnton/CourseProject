Two pipenvs, btest and ctest, corresponding to two parallel dev directories.
cd btest
pipenv shell
# command prompt displays (btest-x_1phj8d), showing that it's active
cd ../ctest
pipenv install foo
cat Pipfile
> [packages]
> foo = "*"
foo gets installed into the ctest venv, even though I never exited the btest venv, and the command prompt says btest is still active.
Not clear if this is a bug or a feature. If a feature, I find it very confusing, as I trust what the modified command prompt is telling me.
