I'm always frustrated when pipenv wants to lock things. This happens when I install and uninstall things. The problem is that it takes FOREVER to lock big scientific packages (that probably include sample data).
I would like to be able to specify completely skipping the locking process within the Pipfile itself.
I've tried to specify --skip-lock in many commands that support it, but some commands simply don't support it. Additionally, if I forget to specify --skip-lock then I have to force quit the program and hope that it maintains a usable state.
