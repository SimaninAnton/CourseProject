I use pipenv install as part of a CI pipeline. When I updated pipenv version used in the pipeline pipenv install stopped working.
Describe your environment
OS Type: Linux
Python version: $ python -V: 3.6.4
Pipenv version: $ pipenv --version 11.1.5
Expected result
Updating pipenv shouldn't make installation stop working.
Actual result
pipenv doesn't install all the dependencies because they have wrong python_requires, for example:
Ignoring pluggy: markers 'python_version == ">=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*"' don't match your environment
Please note that despite the version in python_requires all this packages were working before.
