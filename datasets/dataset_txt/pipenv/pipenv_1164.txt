Hi,
Script shortcuts are great and very helpful in project. But they are too simple and stupid for now. There are some features which will be great to implement to my mind:
Multi-line commands. For now there are no simple way to specify multiple commands, e.g.:
[scripts]
cmd = [
    "echo 1",
    "echo 2"
]
Of course as workaround I can use bash -c "echo 1 && echo 2", but if I want to write something complex with two more command it will be like a mess.
Positional arguments in commands. Would be great to implement something like implemented in tox (http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#substitutions-for-positional-arguments-in-commands). It's very useful for example in case of tests:
[scripts]
test = py.test {posargs:tests/unit/}
And pyenv run test to run all tests or pyenv run test -- tests/unit/test_utils.py to run subset of tests.
This is just a proposal and I'm interesting in what you think about that.
Thanks!
