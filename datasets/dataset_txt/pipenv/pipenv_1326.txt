Expected result
Given this line in my Pipfile (a hacked version of mozilla's bleach, don't judge), I was expecting the corresponding lines of Pipfile.lock to reflect the git dependency. The issue may well be that another part of the dependencies also links to bleach (in which case I would expect an error).
Actual result
Pipfile.lock points to the version from the package index.
Steps to replicate
Clone the linked repo at the specified revision
rm Pipfile.lock
pipenv install
pipenv help output
$ python -m pipenv.help output
Pipenv version: `'11.8.0'`
