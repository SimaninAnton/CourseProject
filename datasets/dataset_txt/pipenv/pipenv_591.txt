This is probably related to #2296, but I'm currently unable to upgrade pipenv past 2018.6.25 using Homebrew.
I have my Python pinned at 3.6.5 with brew switch python 3.6.5_1 && brew pin python
Because of this I have to --build-from-source for any upgrade to a brew-installed package that depends on python as the bottles are built on Python 3.7.
After brew upgrade pipenv --build-from-source I get the following error:
pipenv --help
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/pipenv/2018.10.9/libexec/bin/pipenv", line 6, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/pipenv/2018.10.9/libexec/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 26, in <module>
    import zipfile
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'zipfile'
Switching back to 2018.6.25 resolves the issue, but it'd be nice to get on the latest version.
