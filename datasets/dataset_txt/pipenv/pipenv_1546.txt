In pypa/packaging.python.org#437, @stevepiercy pointed out that the current visual styling of the pipenv docs reflect's Kenneth's personal docs style, moreso than the common PyPA style we've been adopting for pip, the Python packaging user guide, etc.
If folks are OK with the idea of migrating to the PyPA theme, then I'd be happy to put together a PR for that.
