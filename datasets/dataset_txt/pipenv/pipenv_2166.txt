hi, I was wondering if its possible to have a consistent named virtualenv path? Some people on my team like to use pycharm which I believe needs to have a consistent path to a virtualenv to work properly. It's not entirely clear to me right now when the virtualenv path (pipenv --venv) changes.
I understand I can use WORKON_HOME to change the folder but I believe the venv name is still subject to change?
