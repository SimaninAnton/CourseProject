Hello everyone,
First of all thanks for this great project.
I'm trying to use pipenv for one of our projects. After environment setup i just start to install our dependency packages with :
 pipenv install 
But the experience is here really unexpected, it tooks almost 1 hour.
Also when process complete the console says it just takes 4 seconds :
I guess this message is not related about whole process. There must be another items such as indexing, caching or something else.
I think these step needs some improvements in console behaviors.
It could be nice if console output gives correct information about whole process and its current steps.
It could be nice if install process takes less time.
Basic Pipfile for just 3 packages:
[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
numpy = "*"
imutils = "*"
opencv-python = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.7"
