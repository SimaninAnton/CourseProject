I have django-heroku installed in my Pipfile as a package (rather than a dev-package). gunicorn is a dev dependency of django-heroku. See: https://github.com/heroku/django-heroku/blob/master/Pipfile
I would expect that after running pipenv install --dev, I could then run pipenv run gunicorn.
So why does this throw the following error?
Error: the command gunicorn could not be found within PATH or Pipfile's [scripts].
If dev dependencies aren't available, what's the point of install --dev?
$ pipenv --support
