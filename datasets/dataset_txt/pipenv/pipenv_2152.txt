To activate this project's virtualenv, run the following:
 $ pipenv shell
Step 2 pipenv shell:
alien:master* → pipenv shell
ERROR: The virtualenv hasn't been activated correctly.
Either the env is corrupted (try running `pew restore env`),
Or an upgrade of your Python version broke your env,
Or check the contents of your $PATH. You might be adding new directories to it
from inside your shell's configuration file.
In this case, for further details please see: https://github.com/berdario/pew#the-environment-doesnt-seem-to-be-activated
When I active virtualenv manually, it is OK:
alien:master* → . /Users/xxx/.local/share/virtualenvs/alien-g1TPh9jd/bin/activate.fish
(alien-g1TPh9jd) alien:master* →
