Pipenv is not installing anything on Travis CI.
It was working until the last job run with pipenv 9.1.0.
Expected result
The project requirements should have been installed like they were 2 months ago during the last test build.
Actual result
0.50s$ pipenv install --deploy
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1 to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead.
Warning: --system is intended to be used for Pipfile installation, not installation of specific packages. Aborting.
See also: --deploy flag.
The command "pipenv install --deploy" failed and exited with 1 during .
Linke seen in the first line im not using the --system flag it is complaining about.
The old command was 'pipenv install --dev' and i tried out the --deploy in the last test, but im not sure what changed and is keeping me from successfully testing my packaged with travis.
I could manually install an old version i guess, but id like to understand whats wrong here.
Steps to replicate
Let pipenv install requirements on Travis CI.
