Issue description
If I have both pytest and pytest-watch in my Pipfile I get a complaint that "Could not find a version that matches pluggy<0.7,>=0.5,>=0.7" when running pipenv install
Expected result
Since the only dependency in the graph is from pytest pluggy [required: >=0.7, installed: 0.7.1] the install should proceed.
Actual result
Could not find a version that matches pluggy<0.7,>=0.5,>=0.7
Joshuas-MacBook-Pro-2:temp vickeryj$ pipenv graph | grep pluggy
    - pluggy [required: >=0.7, installed: 0.7.1]
    - pluggy [required: >=0.7, installed: 0.7.1]
Steps to replicate
Provide the steps to replicate (which usually at least includes the commands and the Pipfile).

Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
  You can use $ pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass this mechanism, then run $ pipenv graph to inspect the situation.
  Hint: try $ pipenv lock --pre if it is a pre-release dependency.
