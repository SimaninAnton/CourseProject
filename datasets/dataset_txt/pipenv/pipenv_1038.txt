If requests is added to the [dev-packages] section, it will not install it's required dependencies, i.e. urllib3, certifi, chardet, and idna. Issue reproduced in multiple environments.
Expected result
Adding requests to [dev-packages] installs the requests library and all required dependencies.
Actual result
Adding requests to [dev-packages] installs the requests library but does not install dependencies urllib3, certifi, chardet, and idna.
Steps to replicate
Add requests = "*" to the [dev-packages] section of a Pipfile
Delete virtualenv and recreate using pipenv install --dev
Activate created virtualenv with pipenv shell
Open a python interpreter and enter import requests
You should get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'urllib3'
