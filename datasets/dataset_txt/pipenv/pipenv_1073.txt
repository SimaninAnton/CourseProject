Be sure to check the existing issues (both open and closed!).
Checked #1490 and other issued that mention update.
Describe the issue briefly here.
Upgrading package with pipenv update PACKAGE upgrades given PACKAGE but then reinstalls old version.
Please run $ python -m pipenv.help, and paste the results here.
$ python -m pipenv.help output
------------
Expected result
Given I have requests = "==2.17.0" in Pipfile and I change it to requests = "*", running pipenv update requests I would expect to have latest version of requests.
Actual result
(test-BnvVBCnl) root@c4d4399a20d3:/test# pipenv update requests

I found that if I run pipenv lock before step 4, Pipfile.lock would be updated and everything would work as expected for me. Upgrade workflow does not mention need to lock before update.
Please note that in my real project I have "*" version specified but I wouldn't be able to make reproducable case as it happend when new version of package is released.
