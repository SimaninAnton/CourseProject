When I create a venv in a directory, I can access it (through any pipenv command) from that directory, from the directory below it, and from the directory 2 below it. When I go down 3 directories I run into No virtualenv has been created for this project yet!.
Is there any way to set how many directories up pipenv will search for a venv activation site?
PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH doesn't do it.
Or can someone point in the code to where it searches up 2 directories and no more? I can't seem to find that.
