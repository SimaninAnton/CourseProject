Hi,
I am having problems if I want to use pipenv to install tensorflow-gpu.
If I create virtual env in conda, and do "pip install tensoflow-gpu", works like a charm.
However if I do "pipenv install tensoflow-gpu", after I try to import it in python I get
"ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
I have CUDA Version 10.0.130.
/usr/local/ folders: bin cuda cuda-10.0 etc games include lib man sbin share src
I read online that I should install cuda 9 instead of 10, however, tensorflow-gpu in conda works just fine, so if possible I'd like to avoid downgrading.
What is the "goto" way to fix this? How can I set up the same configuration as conda?
Thanks!
