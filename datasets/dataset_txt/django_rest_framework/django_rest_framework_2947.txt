format_suffix_patterns breaks when trying to use django.conf.urls.include() to separate urlpatterns into separate bundles.
I was trying to separate my URLs and define some default parameters to each include() bundle. Similar use case would be to define a function that generates the URL collection for a given serializer (e.g., creates the detail and list urls) and then include them into the main urlconf.
