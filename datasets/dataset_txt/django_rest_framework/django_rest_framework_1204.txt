Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add filter_fields to serializer, the field is a foreign_key with A LOT of rows.
Expected behavior
Just an empty input field, not 500.000 or more options.. There should be some limit on it.
Actual behavior
Loading a filtering form control ( right in the top of the screen) with 500.000 or more items.
the docs.
