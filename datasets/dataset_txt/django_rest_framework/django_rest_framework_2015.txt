The upgrade from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5 broke my code.
I use ModelViewSets with the model attribute, like described in the documentation: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset
I build the urls for the rest-api with the DefaultRouter and did not specify a base_name. This worked fine in the 3.0.4 release but does not in 3.0.5.
The reason is ba7dca8 in which the support for model to generate the base_name was removed.
This is probably only a bug in the documentation which does not say that the model attribute is deprecated. But this could also be a bug in your Deprecation policy that indicates that: "Minor version numbers (0.0.x) are used for changes that are API compatible. You should be able to upgrade between minor point releases without any other code changes."
