Hi!
Currenlty if one have Serializer with DictField and request.data is provided as field value then exception is raised:
TypeError: parse_html_dict() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
The issues can be clearly identified by this peace of code:
if html.is_html_input(data):
    data = html.parse_html_dict(data)
However parse_html_dict requires 2 parameters:
def parse_html_dict(dictionary, prefix):
Kind regards.
