To reproduce this bug place a default pagination limit of, for instance, 50. This with the LimitOffset pagination. Then, in the browsable API for instance, let's say we have 17 objects of a specific collection. This bug happens when you put a different "limit" value than the default, and an "offset" higher than the amount of items.
In summary, for a default of 50 items per page, and 17 items in the collection returned:
https://url_to_list_endpoint/?limit=2&offset=18 (triggers AssertionError)
https://url_to_list_endpoint/?limit=2&offset=50 (triggers AssertionError)
https://url_to_list_endpoint/?offset=50 (does not trigger AssertionError)

Thanks for the hard work!
