 return request.build_absolute_uri(url) 
I am trying to show the image URL but the serializers.ImageField() showing me a wrong path to the image because of the following line that I marked.
serializers.ImageField(use_url=False) is not giving me the correct URL as well.
what is showing me:
"image": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/tutorials/46f54de4-5306-4714-b943-8c2f55d81c56/api/media/defaults/images/tutorial-images/random1.png"
the correct link:
"image": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/media/defaults/images/tutorial-images/random1.png"
currently I am using a SerializerMethodField to fix the problem with the function:
def get_image(self, obj):
        return obj.image.url
