In a view, I have define a get_queryset method in a APIView derived class. For some (not important) reasons, I have made a mistake in my code, but the error message I get is unrelated to the actual mistake: it is an AssertError, complaining there is no .queryset attribute or get_queryset method in the view. And the traceback does only imply files of the framework, not files I haver written and, obviously, neither the file I have made the mistake in.
Steps to reproduce
Create a class in views.py, deriving from APIView. Define a get_queryset method with a mistake in it, say an IndexError. the method do not return anything. Run it.
Txpected behavior
Get an error message involving an IndexError.
Get an error message about the empty return of get_queryset.
Actual behavior
Get an error message related to an AssertError.
