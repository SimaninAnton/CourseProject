What is the best way to handle captcha fields in django rest serializations ?
UPDATE: the senario is : when my user what to register as a new user in my app, i want to ask him to enter the captcha field. imagin somthing like this :
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
# i want something for here,there is no chaptcha feild in drf# 
captcha = CaptchaField(required=True, label="I am not robot", )

username = serializers.CharField(...)
email = serializers.EmailField(...)
password = serializers.CharField(...)
confirm_password = serializers.CharField(...)
