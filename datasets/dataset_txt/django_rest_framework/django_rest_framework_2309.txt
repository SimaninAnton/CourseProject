The project maintainers should be properly called out in the documentation.
That could either be in the credits, in the README/homepage, or in the contributing section.
(Or most likely several of the above places)
We also need to codify the privileges, responsibilities and processes of maintainership in the documentation, so that it's transparent and to reduce bus-factor.
