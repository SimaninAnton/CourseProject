Expected behavior
SchemaGenerator should be overridable.
It can solve a lot of problems and helps to esier integration with drf-yasg or other.
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'SCHEMA_GENERATOR_CLASS': 'rest_framework.schemas.generators.SchemaGenerator'
}
Actual behavior
There is no settings to override SchemaGenerator class.
