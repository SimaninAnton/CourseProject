The docs[0] says:
The only thing needed to make the OAuth2Authentication class work is to insert the access_token you've received in the Authorization request header.
But the authenticate_credentials[1] always check for client_id and client_secret, and use user from it to check the token.
If client_id and client_secret are not informed, the form is invalid because client_id and client_secret are required.
The client_id and client_secret should be only required for requiring the token, right?
