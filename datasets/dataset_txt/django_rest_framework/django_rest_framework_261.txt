I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
(assuming DRF is set up and has API endpoints for which to generate a schema)
Install coreapi, but not pyyaml
run `python manage.py generateschema --format=openapi-json
Expected behavior
The openapi-json schema is printed to stdout
Actual behavior
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./manage.py", line 15, in <module>

AssertionError: Using OpenAPIRenderer, but `pyyaml` is not installed.
Additional Details
Installing pyyaml fixes the problem, but it shouldn't be required if only json formatted schemas are being generated.
Additionally, I found the way that it failed to be misleading - I logged #6359 because the stack trace and error message really looked like the format parameter was being ignored, since --format openapi-json uses JsonOpenAPIRenderer, not OpenAPIRenderer.
