[x ] I have verified that that issue exists against the 3.6.3 branch of Django REST framework.
[x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[x ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[x ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[x ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[x ] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
