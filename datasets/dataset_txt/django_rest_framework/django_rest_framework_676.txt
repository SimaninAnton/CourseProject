We have situations where depending on the permission checks that passed we want to switch the serializer to do something different, like a IsOwner vs a IsFriend check. Then when running through get_serializer_class we check whether request.permissions.get('IsFriend') is True (or not False or None) depending on what we're doing and set a different serializer. It would be nice if this was built into the framework maybe in a way that where if you could instantiate the permission to be used by calling IsFriend(name='are_friends') otherwise it wouldn't set a value on request.permissions at all (to avoid collisions, etc) ...
Thoughts?
