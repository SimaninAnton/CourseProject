I'm using version 2.4, not sure if this affects version 3.
When your model hierarchy has a generic relation with its own foreign key, then when you save the main model, the main model and generic relation save correctly but the generic models relation is not saved - it even actually deletes the relation if one exists.
I have posted my code on StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28076639)
