The UniqueTogetherValidator is incompatible with serializer fields where the serializer field name is different than the underlying model field name. i.e., fields that have a source specified.
This manifests itself in two ways:
For writeable fields, the validator raises a required validation error.
For read-only fields that have a default value, this passes through to the ORM and ultimately raises a django.core.exceptions.FieldError.
