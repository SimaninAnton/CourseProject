If a model's related field allows nulls and has a null value, HyperlinkedRelatedField throws an error.
File "... /python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/fields.py", line 521, in to_native
kwargs = {self.pk_url_kwarg: obj.pk}
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'pk'
If appears that the value is null that is sent as "obj". In HyperlinkedRelatedField.to_native, if obj is None, shouldn't it just return None so the returned data is null?
