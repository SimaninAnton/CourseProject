I would like to add a highlevel perspective in the quickstart.
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
I would like to define terms and steps. I am not a native speaker, I guess this could get improved a lot.
GET Request
client sends a GET request to the DRF application
A Serializer uses the Django ORM and transforms it to ?????? (here I am missing the matching term)
A Renderer takes ?????? and converts it to a bytestring. This can be JSON, YAML, XML, Protocol Buffers, ...
The bytestring gets send to the client as response
POST Request
client sends a POST request to the DRF application. The bytestring in the request can be JSON, YAML, ...
A Parser takes the bytestring and transforms it to ??????.
?????? gets mapped to a Django Model using a Deserizalizer
The data gets saved
A response gets send to the client.
My goal is to speed up new developers and to make them understand how DRF works quicker.
What do you think?
It would be great if there are places in the docs where the terms Serializer, Renderer, Parser gets explained.
I know, for you (the experts) it is all clear :-)
