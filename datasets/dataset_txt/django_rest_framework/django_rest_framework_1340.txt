Due to the loop at https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/metadata.py#L80 the metadata on fields is only showed for POSTs and PUTs. I'm not sure what the reasoning is behind that, but I know why I'd want OPTIONS on a read-only endpoint to include fields info: it documents the choices fields. If you have an IntegerField with choices, the only way a client/developer can see what those interger choices map to is with the OPTIONS method supplying that data. But it's missing on read-only endpoints.
