Hi guys,
I use django-jsonfield and i noticed 2 issues:
the field inherits from TextField but is rendered like a CharField, because it fails if
@ line 472 of serializer.py. It can be solved with:
if issubclass(model_field.__class__, models.TextField):
the json validator is not called, and for that i need you help.
