I have just upgraded from versin2 to version 3.
I have a view SampleDetroyView which inherits from DestroyAPIView. It is very simple, and only gives a model.
class SampleDestroyView(generics.DestroyAPIView):
    model=Sample
It worked fine under version 2, but now gives an error:
SampleDestroyView should either include a `queryset` attribute, or override the `get_queryset()` method. 
As this works on a single model instance, it shouldn't require a queryset.
