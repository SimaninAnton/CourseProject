Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Open https://django-rest-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Expected behavior
Expect to see DRF 3.9 content.
Actual behavior
Looks like it stopped being updated at DRF 3.7 (see last topic: https://django-rest-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/3.7-announcement/)
It's clear that https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ is the up to date documentation site.
Please remove the RTD documentation so others don't get caught by this. It looks like this was reported in #4909 but never resolved. "django-rest-framework.readthedocs.io isn't the official documentation."
