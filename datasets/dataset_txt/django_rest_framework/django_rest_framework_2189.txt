During the tutorial, Snippet creation failed with the following trace: http://dpaste.com/3MTK2BJ
As it happens, raise_errors_on_nested_writes performs checks against validated_attrs:
            '.' in field.source and (key in validated_attrs)
However, validated_attrs isn't an attribute of the function nor it is instantiated before.
