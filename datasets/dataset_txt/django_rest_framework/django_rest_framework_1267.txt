I'm using rest framework version 3.3.2. At loading form by serializer with rest framework template tag method render_form, while django logger has been activated in console, i catch some bad errors in checking style attributes in rest_framewok/templates/rest_framework/vertical/ files.
For example, I have pasted a piece of these errors below:
DEBUG Exception while resolving variable 'hide_label' in template 'rest_framework/vertical/input.html'.

    current = current[bit]
KeyError: 'hide_label'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'hide_label'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
