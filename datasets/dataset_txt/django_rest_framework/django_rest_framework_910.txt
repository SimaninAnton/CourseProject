I am running an API built with Django Rest Framework(DRF). I am using AngularJs for my front-end, mainly for sending the requests to the API. However, I am facing a weird issue:
If I am logged in using the admin panel, and I send the POST request, I get this error from my API:
CSRF token missing
However, if I log out and try again, the request just works. What's going on? It doesn't make much sense to me as I am clearly sending the requests from the same domain, not cross domain.
Any help?
