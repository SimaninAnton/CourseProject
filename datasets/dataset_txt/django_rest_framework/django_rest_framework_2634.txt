I spent a while messing with DjangoFilterBackend before I realised SearchFilter was a much better fit for my problem.
My hunch is that SearchFilter is simpler to understand and it's better to introduce that first.
I also actually wonder if Generic Filtering should be introduced before the manual filter methods the page currently starts with.
