Nullable ListiField as recommended here ListField(child=NestedSerializer(allow_null=True)) does not seem to work on version 3.8.2
e.g.
list_field = ListField(child=NestedSerializer(allow_null=True))
The message returned when setting list_field: null and trying to PATCH is:
"list_field": [
"This field may not be null."
]
To provide some more context, I use MongoDB and django-rest-framework-mongoengine 3.3.1, if this important. django-rest-framework-mongoengine API reference states that
ListField and DictField are mapped to corresponding DRF fields, with respect to nested field specification
so it may (or not) be the right place to raise this issue..
