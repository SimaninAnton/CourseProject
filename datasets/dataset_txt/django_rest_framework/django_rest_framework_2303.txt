With the latest 3.0 (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/archive/version-3.0.zip), I got the following when I collectstatic:
ValueError: The file 'rest_framework/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot' could not be found with <django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage object at 0x7f5955ef7f28>.
Django 1.7 comes with ManifestStaticFilesStorage, a staticfiles storage backend that puts a hash of the file in the filename when you run collectstatic. As part of this process, it introspects CSS files no modify any external files references. For that reason, every @import needs to be a files Django's collectstatic can access. I believe that is the problem here.
