I have a situation where I am generating a slug field in my save method of my model. So DRF is set for that field to be read_only, so that it is only written by the save method. However, this confilcts with the required that is added by get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs. (Obviously I have a multicolumn index including slug)
I think the best solution for this is to simply not add the new args in get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs if the field is set by the user as read_only because clearly this is intentionally saying something different than the default case.
(my error: May not set both read_only and required)
