Hi, this is probably the top DRF question I used to see in my former Python Slack group and I finally encountered it today. Basically the docs for stuff like ListModelMixin are really lacking. There are 15 Generic view classes and only two code examples.
Lets look at api docs for ListModelMixin one sentence at a time.
Provides a .list(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that implements listing a queryset.
This sentence is very confusing. Am I supposed to override this method or just use get(..), then call this method? If I need to override this method, what am I supposed to return?
If the queryset is populated, this returns a 200 OK response, with a serialized representation of the queryset as the body of the response. The response data may optionally be paginated
How do I populate the queryset? How do I tell this list method which serializer to use?
Steps to reproduce
Visit documentation site
Click API Guide ~> Generic Views.
Observe that there is full example for using ListCreateAPIView
Click Mixins
Observe that examples are missing.
Observe that theres no link to prerequisite docs that I'm supposed to know about before using mixins.
Expected behavior
If I had to pick between a description of the mixin or an actual code example using the mixin, I would pick the code example every day of the week, but ideally the API docs would include both.
Actual behavior
Confusing user experience.
