2.3.4 introduced a changed to use the new lookup_field attribute and thus breaks for anyone still using pk_url_kwarg despite it only being a pending deprecation warning.
in field_to_native
2.3.3
kwargs = {self.pk_url_kwarg: obj.pk}
2.3.4
lookup_field = getattr(obj, self.lookup_field)
kwargs = {self.lookup_field: lookup_field}
This really needs a backwards compatible code to support both old and new styles.
