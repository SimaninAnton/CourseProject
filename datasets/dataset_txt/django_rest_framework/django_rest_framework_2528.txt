Hi, I'm trying to get past step 5 of the Tutorial but keep getting an exception along the lines of:
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "user-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the lookup_field attribute on this field.
I'll refrain from pasting all of the code, but here's the link to the files.
Snippets folder: https://github.com/ibraheem4/stonenuts/tree/de69da466b8ca75c1b019650a60c27bc608260ff/StoneNuts/snippets
Main urls.py (since I am using a URLs file across the whole project):
https://github.com/ibraheem4/stonenuts/blob/de69da466b8ca75c1b019650a60c27bc608260ff/StoneNuts/StoneNuts/urls.py
Any help here would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
