In Django models, there are some fields called virtual_fields.
ModelSerializer cannot generate serializer fields for them automatically.
example code:
from django.db import models

from rest_framework import serializers


class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)


class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)


class AlbumSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Album
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'artist_id')


album = Album.objects.last()
data = AlbumSerializer(album).data
that will raise an error:
ImproperlyConfigured: Field name `artist_id` is not valid for model `Album`.
