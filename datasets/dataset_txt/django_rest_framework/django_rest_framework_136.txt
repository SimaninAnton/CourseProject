Steps to reproduce
In my system I have around 200 models, for each one there is 6 different urls, 2 for get and post without ids, and the others with get, put, patch and delete passing the id, so, in the end the API contains 1200 urls in total. But the rest_framework load to slow all these urls.
My example model:
Actually my serializers.py example:
My views.py example:
And my urls.py example:
Expected behavior
The loading should be faster. With all the amount of urls that I mention.
Actual behavior
With the same serializers.py, views.py and urls.py the loading takes more than 4 minutes, when I reduced the urls to only 6 the loading was fast as it should be, but with all the 1200 urls, it takes unusable.
