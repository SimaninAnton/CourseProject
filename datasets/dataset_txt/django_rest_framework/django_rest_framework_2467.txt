Hello,
I am not sure whether this is worth an issue, but the permission class IsAdminUser currently checks for the is_staff flag (changed in #88). The name of the permission class suggests, that the user needs to have the is_superuser flag. Maybe the name IsStaffUser would be a better choice and an additional IsAdminUser class would check for the is_superuser flag instead, just to clarify the naming of the permission class.
With kind regards,
Henning
