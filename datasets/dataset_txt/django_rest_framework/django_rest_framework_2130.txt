Hello,
I have the following datefield:
dob = DateField(allow_null=True, required=False)
When I try to set it to an empty string '' using json input, I get:
dob: [Date has wrong format. Use one of these formats instead: YYYY[-MM[-DD]]]
It wouldn't surprise me if the other date time fields have the same problem.
Thanks
