We should include some documentation around sensible ways to deal with atomicity in transactions, and also deal properly with ATOMIC_REQUESTS correctly. This needs both documentation, and probably also enhancements for handling ATOMIC_REQUESTS = True, which is complicated by the fact that we use a custom exception handler.
PR #1787 was an attempt at this but doesn't take the right approach, unsure how to resolve currently.
