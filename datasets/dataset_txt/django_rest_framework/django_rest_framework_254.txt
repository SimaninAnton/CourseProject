Steps to reproduce
Python3, Django 2.1.4, DjangoRestFramework 3.9.0
When finish the tutorial, I want to documenting the API, so follow this guide:
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/
Expected behavior
function based views, class baed views and viewset can be seen in /docs
Actual behavior
Only using generic class basd views, the post method is OK.
when using function based views or APIView class, the post method can be seen, but no parameters in dialog
when using viewsets, no post method can be seen.
