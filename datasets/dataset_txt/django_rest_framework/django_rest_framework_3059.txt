The styles.css file contains references to two non-existant files in Django 1.4 (arrow-up.gif and arrow-down.gif). It also adds an extra admin/ directory to image paths, e.g.
../../admin/img/admin/nav-bg-grabber.gif
instead of the correct path
../../admin/img/nav-bg-grabber.gif
From the Django 1.4 release notes:
and arrow-up.gif and
arrow-down.gif were combined into sorting-icons.gif.
I can provide a patch if you want. I'm curious about the path issue though. Any reason why the extra admin/ directory exists?
