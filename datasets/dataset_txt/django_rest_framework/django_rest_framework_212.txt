 if len(self.history) >= self.num_requests: 

This might not be a major issue, but I reckon the comparison above will raise a failure slightly earlier than expected.
Fix:
if len(self.history) > self.num_requests:
which makes it possible for the requests history length to go up until the actual limit. The failure will be raised right after in the next request.
