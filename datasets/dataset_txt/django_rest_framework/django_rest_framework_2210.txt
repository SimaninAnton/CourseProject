From IRC:
tomchristie > Maybe worth raising an issue on https://github.com/jpadilla/django-rest-framewo... that it should also point to OAuth toolkit as an alternative on the README.me and index.md?
maryokhin > wouldn't it be a bit confusing to go to that package and then find you're supposed to use the other one? 
maybe just point in DRF docs that recommended now is oauth-toolkit, 
but here's the thingy we moved out of core for those that don't want to stir up life too much? 
tomchristie > That's exactly how we should describe it, yes ^
