Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Use the rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication authentication class.
Expected behavior
A Vary: Authorization header should appear.
The header should be there since we are doing something based on the authorization header which could return different content for the same url. If we don't, and have caching turned on, then the results for one user ends up cached for other users.
Actual behavior
No Vary: Authorization header.
