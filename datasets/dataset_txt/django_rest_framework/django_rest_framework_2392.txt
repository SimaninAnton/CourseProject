I have a use case, when the attributes on my model are not methods, but functools.partial instances behaving like methods (ie. accepting a single argument named self). It seem the is_simple_callable returns False for these cases and I get my serialized data to be repr() of functools.partial objects.
Should we also check for partial objects here? Is there a way to cleanly override this behavior in order to handle my use case?
I would happily provide a pull request to fix this, but I wanted to bring this up to see some opinions.
Thanks!
