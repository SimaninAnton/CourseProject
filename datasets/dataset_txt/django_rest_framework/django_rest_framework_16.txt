I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Recently, I have implemented Swagger with OpenAPI with this code:
from rest_framework.schemas import get_schema_view
...
urlpatterns = [
   path('openapi', get_schema_view(
        title="API for all things test",
        description="API for all things test",
        version="1.0.0"
    ), name='openapi-schema'),
   ...
    path('docs', TemplateView.as_view(
        template_name='swagger-ui.html',
        extra_context={'schema_url':'openapi-schema'}
    ), name='swagger-ui')
]
Expected behavior
APIs should be group by the first element of a path like that
Actual behavior
APIs that grouped by default
