It would be nice to be able to set the depth setting for individual fields on a Serializer instead of only being able to do so for all of the nested fields.
Probably a new depth keyword argument for the Field class.
It seems that this enhancement could have the side benefit of making the ModelSerializer.get_default_fields method shorter by shifting some of the depth responsibility to the fields.
