Sorry to bring this up again, but I don't think the issue is quite resolved. The offered solution, setting blank=True in the model, seems to be a workaround rather than a desired state. The purpose of partial=True, is stated as: "You can use the partial argument in order to allow partial updates." So if I have a database entry that is full, but I want to update one ore two of the entries, then I can use the partial argument. However, in order to do this I have to set every other field in the database to blank=True, which is a problem because these fields are not optional, they are simply not being updated at this time.
Sorry if this comes across as beating a dead horse, I assure you, that isn't my intention!
