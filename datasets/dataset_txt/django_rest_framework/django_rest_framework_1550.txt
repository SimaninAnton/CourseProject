Running against Django master there are a lot of issues.
1 warnings, 265 error in 137.92 seconds
Most of these are caused by Django Guardian.
Excluding that from the requirements leads to something more reasonable:
5 failed, 239 passed, 1 warnings, 21 error in 11.27 seconds
Only two types of failure:
tests/test_utils.py:153: in setUp
    self.get_model = rest_framework.utils.model_meta.models.get_model
E   AttributeError: module 'django.db.models' has no attribute 'get_model'

...

tests/browsable_api/test_browsable_api.py:36: in test_login_shown_when_logged_out
    self.assertContains(response, '>Log in<')
.tox/py35-djangomaster/lib/python3.5/site-packages/django/test/testcases.py:398: in assertContains
    msg_prefix + "Couldn't find %s in response" % text_repr)
E   AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find '>Log in<' in response
Errors are all these:
.tox/py35-djangomaster/lib/python3.5/site-packages/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py:682:
...
E   TypeError: Call constructor takes either 0 or 3 positional arguments

...
tests/test_filters.py:11: in <module>
    from django.utils import unittest
E   ImportError: cannot import name 'unittest'
I don't think there's much work there but it's masked by the Guardian issues.
