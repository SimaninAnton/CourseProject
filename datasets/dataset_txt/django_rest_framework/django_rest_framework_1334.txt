Hi,
I'm trying to fix a view that used to return data from haystack through django rest framework, I've rewrtitten the view and it's returning the json but the dictionary inside has " " around it so it's read as a string. I've asked the question on stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34765847/json-format-for-python they suggest I convert it to json but that only adds more escapes (double jsonify) will appreciate any help with this.
