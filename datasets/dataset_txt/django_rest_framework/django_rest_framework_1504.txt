I needed a permission class which has read only endpoints to authenticated users. In docs I couldn't find anything similar so I implemented own:
class IsAuthenticatedAndReadOnly(permissions.IsAuthenticated):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return super(IsAuthenticatedAndReadOnly, self).has_permission(
                request, view)
do you think this has a place in DRF? Then I could send a PR
