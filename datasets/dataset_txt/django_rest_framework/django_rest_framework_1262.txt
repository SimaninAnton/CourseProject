I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
@property
def DATA(self):
    raise NotImplementedError(
        '`request.DATA` has been deprecated in favor of `request.data` '
        'since version 3.0, and has been fully removed as of version 3.2.'
    )
and
@Property
def QUERY_PARAMS(self):
raise NotImplementedError(
'request.QUERY_PARAMS has been deprecated in favor of request.query_params '
'since version 3.0, and has been fully removed as of version 3.2.'
)
