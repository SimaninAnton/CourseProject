The WrappedAPIView returned/created by the @api_view decorator handles decorators like @renderer_classes, but not @serializer_class.
Having information about the (input) serializer appears to be important for generating schemas however.
I think this would have helped with the underlying issue that #4285 fixed, and is maybe also what #5630 (comment) refers to?!
