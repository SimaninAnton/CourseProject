Wondering why there isn't a post_save for the view mixins. My scenario is that I need to add a related model on create. This can't be done in pre_save because the model needs to exist to create the relationship. In my particular case, it also can't be done in save on the serializer, because it requires access to the request object.
Does it make sense to add post_save, or is there some other suggested way of accomplishing what I'm trying to do? post_save actually isn't a perfect solution either since the object returned by the serializer may be cached and not contain the new data. Perhaps this situation is unique enough that I should just avoid using CreateModelMixin.
