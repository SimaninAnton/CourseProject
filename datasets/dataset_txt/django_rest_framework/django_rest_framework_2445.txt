The documentation at http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields mention that 'required' is a core argument for serializer fields. However, it will throw an exception if passed to a Field class. The field must inherit WritableField for required to be accepted.
I suggest splitting the "Core Arguments" into those that are relevant to Field and those that are relevant to WritableField.
