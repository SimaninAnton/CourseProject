this is my code ..
'''
var location = "http://localhost:8000/api/item/"
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open('GET', location, false);
req.setRequestHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '...');
req.send(null);
$scope.headers = req.getAllResponseHeaders().toLowerCase();
'''
but i am getting the error
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8000/api/item/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.
do i need to add something to settings.py or is there something else i am missing in my javascript code
