Hello,
I understand the need for the following assertion:
AssertionError at /api/persons/476/
The `.update()` method does not support writable nestedfields by default.
Write an explicit `.update()` method for serializer `spud.serializers.PersonSerializer`, or set `read_only=True` on nested serializer fields.
However there are times when the built in update method does exactly the right thing anyway.
e.g. when the nested field is a PrimaryKeyRelatedField. Or other cases when the serializer returns a primary key. It is quite safe to update a a ForeignKey with a primary key, I don't see anything ambiguous here.
Please can we have some way of disabling the assertion when it is not needed?
As a test, I commented out the assertion, and it works fine.
Thanks
