Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
In Django with Gunicorn which has four workers, I use TokenAuthentication. Multiple users send requests to the server in the meanwhile.
Expected behavior
Users only get data belonging themselves.
Actual behavior
TokenAuthentication may provide the wrong request.user and request.META, causing some users may get data belonging to one of the users who send requests in the meanwhile. However, I try to send a token to the server with POST, then get the user object by the token instead of request.user. All users can get correct data.
