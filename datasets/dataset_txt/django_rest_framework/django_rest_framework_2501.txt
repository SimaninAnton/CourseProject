I applied the pull request 1457 to my workspace and it works beautifully. Only once case it doesn't work is if the tables are empty.
i.e. referring to my post ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-rest-framework/Xlk3mokfHFs )
if both SensorData and Annotation tables are empty the POST request fails with error shown below, however if I already have one entry in table sensordata then all the POST attempt work beautifully. Unfortunately I don't understand the intricacies of django framework code to fix it.
{
"annotations": [
{
"sensordata": [
"Invalid pk '1' - object does not exist."
]
}
]
}
