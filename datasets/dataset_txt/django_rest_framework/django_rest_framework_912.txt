I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
We use DRF in our app. The app is documented with Sphinx. When I override the list() method in a viewset, Sphinx get confused and doesn't build the docs anymore:
docstring of myapp.actions.device.DeviceActionManager.update_or_create:None: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference u'list': views.api.MyViewSet.list, views.api.MyOtherViewSet.list
For clarity: we have a
:rtype: list
in a lot of places in our docs. It seems to clash with the list() method of the ViewSet.
Expected behavior
I'm not sure this is a bug, or if there is an solution that doesn't involve renaming the current list() method in a viewset. I just stumbled on it when I did override the list method in one of my ViewSets; which forced me to change our docs in a lot of places.
