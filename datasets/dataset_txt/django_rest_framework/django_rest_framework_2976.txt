Restructured text is pretty much the standard in the Python world. I'm documenting my API with Sphinx, so I want restructured text everywhere.
It would be pretty easy and non-intrusive to add a test similar to apply_markdown called apply_restructured_text that tests whether docutils can be imported. And then an else after the if apply_markdown so that restructured text is applied if available.
This would keep markdown rendering for those that have it installed, but would enable rst for many others. And the way docutils renders non-rst text is pretty much similar to the current \n-to-br handling.
OK to add a pull request or is this something you don't want? I already have code ready in a custom base class, so I can copy/paste something over :-)
