I just spent an hour trying to hunt this down. I tried to have different Serializers depending on the action. The list should only list URLs to the detail view and the detail view have all the info. I always got this error:
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "collection-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the lookup_field attribute on this field.
I tried everything, from manually defining the HyperlinkedIdentityField to fiddling with the viewsets... At some point I had the idea to try including the namespace when passing view_name but couldn't get it to work still.
In the end I solved this with simply removing the namespace attribute from my URL patterns.
So, my suggestion is to add this as a possible solution to the error message. It might save humanity many hours of troubleshooting.
