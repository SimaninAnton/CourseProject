so after upgrading to 2.2, I get this error a lot
init() keywords must be strings
and after a little research it turns out that it has to do with kwarg keys need to be strings in anything less than python 2.6.5
e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4598604/how-to-pass-unicode-keywords-to-kwargs
This happens for example in when attempting to use a RelatedField
even without passing any parameters, it will barf on line 51. (below is line 50-51 of relations.py)
    kwargs['read_only'] = kwargs.pop('read_only', self.read_only)
    super(RelatedField, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
Not sure what the best fix would be here. Obviously upgrading to at least 2.6.5 is ideal but i may not be able to do this =(
