The current repository's name is 'Web APIs for Django' which is far too vague and doesn't quite convey how powerful DRF is and the fact that it's the most popular, recommended framework for building REST APIs in Django. Even https://github.com/encode/apistar has the description A smart Web API framework, designed for Python 3
I propose to change it to something like Powerful, flexible toolkit for building REST APIs in Django (which is taken off the website description) or something on those lines. What do you guys think?
