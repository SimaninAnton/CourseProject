I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Use APITestCase's client with Request on 2.16.0
Expected behavior
It works
Actual behavior
Requests tore out all its vendor packages in their most recent release (2.16.0). We now get an error because we relied on those vendored packages (namely urllib3).
from rest_framework.test import APITestCase
  File "/home/ubuntu/virtualenvs/venv-2.7.12/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/test.py", line 30, in <module>
class HeaderDict(requests.packages.urllib3._collections.HTTPHeaderDict):
  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'packages'
