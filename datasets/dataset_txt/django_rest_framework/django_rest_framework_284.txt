Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
In a python2.7, Django 1.11 ( < 1.11.6), you must be logged into your Django account.
from rest_framework.authentication import *
check = CSRFCheck()
check.process_request({})
Expected behavior
The code should keep on going
Actual behavior
AttributeError: 'CSRFCheck' object has no attribute 'process_request'
More details
Looks likes this method was introduced in Django 1.11.6 therefore DRF 3.9.0

Seeing the view as an Anonymous works fine.
