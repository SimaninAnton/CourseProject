New feature suggestion for next release
It would be great to have built-in authentication views that respect security best practices to quickly implement REST authentication system.
Django has this feature for classic web apps and it works greate but is not suited for Rest Architeture.
Many existing third-party libraries have low quality with lack of customization possibilities
