I would like to provide the get_absolute_url method with models, which gets used in Django's admin for example to provide a "view on site" link.
For this I think the most robust approach appears to be looking through all serializers (and its fields) to find the one using the model, and then get the url via its get_url method.
It needs to take into account extra_kwargs['url'] (view_name and lookup_field).
Does this make sense?
Is there a better approach to this?
