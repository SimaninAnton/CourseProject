I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.

This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test
Steps to reproduce
python3.x (reporduceable on 3.4 - 3.6)
Install django 2.0beta & latest DRF
Create simple model
Create simple HyperlinkedModelSerializer that uses 'url' field instead of 'id'
Create simple viewset
run standard django runserver (wsgiref)
POST new model
Expected behavior
model gets created without any issues
Actual behavior
models is created but:
Exception is raised by wsgiref from here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/wsgiref/headers.py#L43
The issue is that header is of type Hyperlink, and wsgiref explicitly checks for str only
It's caused here: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/mixins.py#L30
The data is not a str
