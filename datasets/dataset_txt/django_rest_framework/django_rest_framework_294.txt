Some of the deprecation warnings are not consistent with the deprecation policy. e.g., the DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter is documented as pending deprecation, but the actual warning that is issued is PendingDeprecation.
I'd recommend using Django's deprecation, as it cleanly documents when something is going to be removed, as well as being easier to manage (only need to update the warning in one location).
