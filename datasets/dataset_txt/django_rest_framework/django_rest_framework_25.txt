I'm using a third party django app (https://github.com/Tivix/django-rest-auth/) and I'd like to apply rate limiting to specific URLS. I've seen the decorator docs to add to a view but I'd rather not have to subclass each view and instead just pass an array of URLS in my settings.py for DRF. Is that a possibility?
