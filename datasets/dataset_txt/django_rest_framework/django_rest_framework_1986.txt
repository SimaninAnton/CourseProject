Dict field was introduced as simple copy of ListField, so there were two errors, first one (to return dictionary) was already fixed (#2485 is also referring to it) but there is a very small issue (as well addressed in #2485) but mistakenly set as enhancement - change initial value from empty list to empty dict {}.
When this will be changed, posting from "Raw" tab in API view should improve (default - empty - value will be set correctly).
