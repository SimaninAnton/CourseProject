update_fields allows django to do a partial row update instead of writing the whole row which can significantly improve write performance, as well as be a more accurate representation of the desired behavior when only certain attributes are sent to the server.
My current workaround is to set self.attrs = attrs in restore_object, and then add kwargs['update_fields'] = self.attrs.keys() to save_object in my serializer. I would be willing to create a pull request with this idea for all ModelSerializers, but I would like some feedback on this issue first.
