Hello!
I'm running into an issue with trying to POST to an object endpoint. Previously, I had this set up with the action decorator (which I see has now been deprecated in favor of detail_route in this case).
I believe this has to do with how the mapping is being set without the 'post' key, since it's an object and not a list endpoint. I understand that semantically, you should really be 'posting' to a list and not an object, but I think there are cases that should allow 'posting' to an individual object. In my case, I'm using it for a user login endpoint.
Is there any easy way around this?
