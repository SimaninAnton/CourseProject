While trying to use the Field.initial property just like I'm used to do that with regular Django fields, in DRF this property does not accept a callable. When rendering serializer fields in HTML the initial becomes something like <function func_name_here0x0000000>
Example:
def some_callable():
    return uuid4().hex

class FooSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    test_field = serializers.CharField(initial=some_callable)
The expected behaviour (in a default Django field) would be a input with a uuid as it's initial value, but DRF tries to render the function object.
