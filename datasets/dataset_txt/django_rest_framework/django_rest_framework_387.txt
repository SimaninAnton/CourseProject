Catching and silently discarding the TypeError and ValueError seems overly broad, is it necessary?
I'm asking, after spending time debugging a derived HyperlinkedRelatedField where, it turns out, I was using the wrong method signature, which was throwing TypeError exceptions that DRF was thing reporting as 'object not found'.
Turns out there was an error in the documentation which I've patched in #6024
Maybe correcting the docs is enough to prevent similar mistakes in the future, but catching TypeError could mask all sorts of errors, is it too broad?
