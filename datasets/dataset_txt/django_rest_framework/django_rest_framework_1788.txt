Currently, the documentation site of django rest framework is not versioned. It caused much inconvenience to me, especially when I was reading a book whose code snippets use an older version of django rest framework. It would be great if drf's doc can be versioned (with links in every pages linking to different versions), just as how Python's official documentation and Django's documentation do it.
