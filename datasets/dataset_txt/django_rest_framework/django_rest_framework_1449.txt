I have a serializer with a field that is a list of subobjects (specified by subobjects=SubobjectSerializer(many=True, required=False)). The subobjects field has the extra_kwargs 'subobjects': {'read_only': True}. The serializer's create method creates the subobjects, not needing any data for them.
The bug is that the html input form isn't recognizing that the subobjects field is read-only and thus is still displaying the Subobjects: Lists are not currently supported in HTML input. warning and throwing a TypeError exception upon creation because "subobjects": [] is being passed to the object creation and is not an explicit field in the object (it is the related_name of the foreignkey field of the subobject).
Edit: Just remembered this is version 3.2.4. I would check a newer version but am using this version due to a bug in the 3.3.0.
Edit2: This appears to be true for all nested serializers. Updating title.
