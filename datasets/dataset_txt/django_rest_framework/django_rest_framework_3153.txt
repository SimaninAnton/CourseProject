renderers.py makes extensive use of bare except statements to try various ways of getting a form before falling back to alternatives.
This makes it almost impossible to be debug actual errors with the form rendering process since the errors are silently discarded and there's no way to bypass the bare except statements.
It would be preferable if these clauses instead used "except Exception:" to catch all typical errors, while still allowing SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt, GeneratorExit and BaseException itself to escape.
Then a well-placed "raise BaseException('info')" could be used to help work out what is going wrong with the rendering process.
