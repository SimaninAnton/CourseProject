I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a RequestsClient object
Call the get method on the client object with any url passed in as an argument
from rest_framework.test import APISimpleTestCase, RequestsClient

class LiveTests(APISimpleTestCase):
    
    def test_get_base(self):
        client = RequestsClient()
        response = client.get('http://google.com')
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
        assert response.status_code == 200
Run the test python manage.py test
Expected behavior
An appropriate response status code based on the request, for example, http://google.com should produce something in the 200 range.
Actual behavior
The response status code is always 500.
Note that this occurs with or without the pdb debugger. It also occurs whether I use SimpleTestCase from django.test or APISimpleTestCase from rest_framework.test
