The documentation on the website is shifted up from the intended attribute, for example, in views.py, line 46:
"""
List of parsers the resource can parse the request with.
"""
parsers = parsers.DEFAULT_PARSERS
This should be:
parsers = parsers.DEFAULT_PARSERS
"""
List of parsers the resource can parse the request with.
"""
This mistake makes the documentation hard to follow, the above results in the documentation for the authentication attribute being attributed to the parsers attribute.
parsers
List of all authenticating methods to attempt.
on the page:
http://django-rest-framework.org/library/views.html
If this is not intentional, and I am sane, let me know and I will send a pull request that fixes this.
