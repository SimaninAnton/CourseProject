Just opening this issue to track what we think is required for 3.11.
I've been spending a lot of time on the ASGI ecosystem stuff lately so not fully up to speed here, but looks like #6172 is one of the big ones we need to get resolved.
Anything else need to go on the list? Anything related to OpenAPI?
I could also put some working into sharpening up this API docs tooling now that we've dropped the Core API approach, depending on if it would tie in nicely with 3.11
