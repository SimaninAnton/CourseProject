I apologize if this is possible, but from the documentation it doesn't look like you can create a ScopedRateThrottle that only affects anonymous users. (So for example, anyone without an API key is throttled based on certain scopes).
The only solution appears to be a custom throttle class, but it seems like something that would be common enough to have built in. Is there already a way to do this?
