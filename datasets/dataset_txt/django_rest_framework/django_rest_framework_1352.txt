I am using Django 1.8 and DRF 3.3.1. I am still facing similar issue referenced in #1101.
class UserSetting(models.Model):
    allow_search_by_email = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    allow_profile_indexing = models.BooleanField(('Allow indexing?'), default=True)

class UserSettingSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
        model = UserPrivacySetting
        fields = [
                    'allow_profile_indexing','allow_search_by_email',
                    ]
But whenever I am posting a blank form, and validating the serializer, it sets false to both the fields.
The issue #1101 was closed in #2311 but I am still facing the similar issue.
Is it fixed ? or
Should i use the workaround using extra_kwargs ?
