This is a feature request. I'm not even sure if it's a feature... anyway for me this have sense:
return Response(None)  # status code 204
return Response('')    # status code 200
If I return Response(None) the status code should be 204, isn't it? Right now it returns 200. I think that my proposal follows better the HTTP Standard. I know, all this is very philosophical, it's just my two cents for this great framework.
