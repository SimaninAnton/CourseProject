I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a serializer with DateTimeField
class DateSerializer(serializers.Serializer):

    date = fields.DateTimeField()
Pass UNIX epoch timestamp
>> a = DateSerializer(data={'date':'1508239944313'})
Validate the serializer by calling is_valid()
Expected Result
The serializer should validate the data
Actual Result
The serializer raises error upon validation
More Information
There should be a way to validate unix epoch timestamp by using DateTimeField by including an extra input_formats argument like input_formats=['epoch_timestamp']
