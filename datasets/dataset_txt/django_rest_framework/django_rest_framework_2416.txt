I have created a permissions file for the isOwnerOrReadOnly permission but the has_object_permission function is not being called at all (I have place a print statement there to check).
This is how I am using this permission in my view:
class CarDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
.....
serializer_class = car_serializers.CarSerializer
authentication_classes = (authentication.TokenAuthentication,)
permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,IsOwnerOrReadOnly,)
