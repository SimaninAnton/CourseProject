Would it be feasible to add support for Streaming Responses?
I haven't dug deep into django-rest-framework's source code, yet, so I'm not sure how much of the Response object used is custom-coded. If it's something that should be relatively easy to pull off, can you point me in the right direction and I'll give it a shot?
Thanks!
