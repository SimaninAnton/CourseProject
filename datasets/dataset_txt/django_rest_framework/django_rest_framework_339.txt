Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
d = {'a':1, 'b': {'c':3}}
class S(serializers.Serializer):
  b = serializers.JSONfield(source='b.c')

s = S(data=d)
s.is_valid()
s.data
Expected behavior
Want to set a 'b' field to 'c' value (3)
How to achieve that without redefining field class every time?
For instance I need to use custom field in many serializers, but want to return only concrete field.
I assume source should 'source' a field from object, but not.
Actual behavior
returns whole dict
