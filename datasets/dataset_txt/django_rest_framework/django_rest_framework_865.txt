I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
i know that
The write _only_fields option on ModelSerializer has been moved to      
PendingDeprecation and replaced with a more generic extra_kwargs"
in documents..
I do not know why 'write_only_fields' has been removed.
But it seems to had been used in the past versions (#1306)
Anyway, I feel uncomfortable.
'Read_only_fields' is available but,
'Write_only_fields' is not available
At least until the day "read_only_fields" is available
I think you need a error(or warning) about 'write_only_fields'.
(Like 'write_only fields is not available')
I think it will reduce confusion.
