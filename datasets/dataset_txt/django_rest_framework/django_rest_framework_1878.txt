Is there a simple way for enforcing only a certain Content-Type. Now you can set a limited list of parsers, but this does not result in a 415 error for requests with the header Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data.
I would like to have a 415 raised on not listed content types.
