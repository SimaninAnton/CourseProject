I have djangorestframework 3.2.4 and django 1.8.5 installed globally and everything is working fine from that environment.
If I create an environment with djangorestframework 3.3.0 and django 1.8.5, the exact same project with the same local db works until I try to post a form from the browsable api. The POST fails with "This field is required", even if there was data. All I've tested so far is POSTing from the HTML form, but this occurs even in the most basic tutorial.
