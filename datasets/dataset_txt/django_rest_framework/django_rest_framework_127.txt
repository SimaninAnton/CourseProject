I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a viewset class that sets the renderer_classes property.
Import the renderer_classes decorator as renderer_classes_decorator.
Use it to decorate a view on the viewset.
Expected behavior
The decorated view should have a different set of renderer classes.
Actual behavior
The decorated view has the same set of renderer classes as the rest of the viewset.
