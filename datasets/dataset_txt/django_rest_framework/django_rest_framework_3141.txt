The documentation of ModelResource at http://django-rest-framework.org/library/resource.html doesn't look right:
form:
The model class which this resource maps to.
This can be overridden by a model attribute on the views.View.
fields:
The list of fields to exclude. This is only used if fields is not set.
Seems like the texts don't match up to the right description texts..
