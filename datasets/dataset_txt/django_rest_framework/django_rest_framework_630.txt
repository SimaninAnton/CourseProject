Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
You just need a simple app with the docs enabled to reproduce this, e.g.
from rest_framework.documentation import include_docs_urls

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'docs/', include_docs_urls(title='My API')),
]
Then go to docs/ url in the browser.
Expected behavior
I would prefer it loaded static files, css and fonts from the same domain only.
Actual behavior
The file bootstrap-theme.min.css is loading an external font from Google which is not always desirable for ultra secure systems locked down by CSP rules, I would prefer all static files come from my own domain only.
In django-rest-framework/rest_framework/static/rest_framework/docs/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css it has this line at the top:
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,500,700");/*!
Can we change this either to another font, OR server the same font locally if Googles license permits it?
