With this view in place I can create, read, list, and delete resources. Why can't I PUT and PATCH?
class SnippetViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
It's a StackOverflow nightmare looking at the different ways people are handling .partial_update() for the past few years.
Here I am trying to update the code field using params in postman
Also, why is PATCH returning 200 when nothing was PATCH'ed?
