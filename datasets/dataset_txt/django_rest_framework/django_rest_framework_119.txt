Hi there awesome work BTW.
just trying to overwrite all helper text from my model, cause the Help that i need to print on UI is compliantly different from API
So would like to overwrite ti in bunch
something like
class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = FIELDS
       help_texts = {'field_one':''MyAPiHelpText', field_two: 'MyAPiHelpText'}
Any clue of how to do that?
Thanks
