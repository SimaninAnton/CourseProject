What is a reason to pass field_name which is never used?
def initialize(self, parent, field_name):
"""
Called to set up a field prior to field_to_native or field_from_native.
    parent - The parent serializer.
    field_name - The name of the field being initialized.
    """
    self.parent = parent
    self.root = parent.root or parent
    self.context = self.root.context
    self.partial = self.root.partial
    if self.partial:
        self.required = False
