Tried to install djangorestframework using pip -
$ pip install djangorestframework
Downloading/unpacking djangorestframework
Real name of requirement djangorestframework is djangorestframework
Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement djangorestframework
No distributions at all found for djangorestframework
Storing complete log in /Users/J/.pip/pip.log
Am I missing anything?
