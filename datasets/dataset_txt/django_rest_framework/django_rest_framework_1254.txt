I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question.
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library.
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request.
Steps to reproduce
Create any kind of nested namespace,
Try to access the url,
10fa40a
Expected behavior
NamespaceVersioning should only pull the first namespace encountered instead of whole : delimited string
Actual behavior
Returns "Invalid version in URL path.", not even namespace versioning error.
