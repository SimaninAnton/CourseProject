I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
I'm facing issue to generate a proper api schema with nice data models definitions. Generating client code from my api schema result in models respectively named data, data1, data2, data3
Steps to reproduce
I just installed django_rest_auth and add some custom serializer and settings to enable email login, I also use django_rest_swagger to generate the schema. But I can't find a way to obtain definitions of objects model (in drf or drf_swagger), looking at the code make me think that this is just not implemented
Expected behavior

this come from the swagger-editor pet store sample
Actual behavior
any help about how to perform this (if a missed something in code or documentation) is welcome
