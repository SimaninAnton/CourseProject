Hi. I've been through this tutorial http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/ and it was nice. However, I have no idea how to implement update request.
I have
def update(self, instance, validated_data):
        """
        Update and return an existing `Snippet` instance, given the validated data.
        """
        instance.title = validated_data.get('title', instance.title)
this method in my serializers.py class.
I can create snippets by this:
http -a user:pwd POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/snippets/ title="print 782", code="dsfs"
What line can I update existed snippet?
Thanks
