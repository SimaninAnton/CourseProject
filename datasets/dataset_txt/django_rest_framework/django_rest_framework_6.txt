I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
link to issue explaining "pause" on maintenance
Expected behavior
Actual behavior
Discussion:
Should the DRF documentation point to projects no longer maintained/"on pause".
Given the critical nature of authentication, I think it would be good to either remove the project from the documentation or display its maintenance status. Especially as it is just mentioned in an issue.
