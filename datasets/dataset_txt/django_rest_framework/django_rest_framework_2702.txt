Since you are not going to accept #1048 I think that we should provide an alternative (possibly with the existing API) and document it. If there is none, it should be implemented.
Of course I can use @action and @link but implementing the full dispatch functionality of a ViewSet is just wrong.
It's such a common use case that I argue that it must be in the core.
My suggestion is to allow to return a viewset from a function that is decorated with @action.
The action's methods will be determined using the viewset's mixins (or through another mechanism that I am not aware of).
This solves the routing problem completely without changing the router and I believe that the implementation will be much easier.
If HyperlinkedRelatedField supports @action as well there won't be any further changes necessary in the code base.
