A good enhancement (in my opinion) will be a possibility to also have a setter in the SerializerMethodField.
So of only having get_<field_name> an option to have set_<field_name>
Proposed solution
Set it as a possible kwarg as in setter="set_something". When the SerializerMethodField's to_internal_value is fired it can check if this setter kwarg is set up and fire this function:
something = SerializerMethodField(setter="set_something")


def set_something(self, value, obj):
   obj.value = value
   return obj
Just an enhancement I thought would be nice to have, any thoughts?
