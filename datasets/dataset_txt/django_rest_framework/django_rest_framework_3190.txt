Everything that's in utils at the moment really ought to be private.
I'd also like to make sure that any imports from utils only require statements like:
from djangorestframework.utils import xxx
Rather than
from djangorestframework.utils.xxx import yyy
All the util imports should be regular functions - no importing classes anywhere from utils.
Finally the xml stuff ought to be split out into a separate file.
