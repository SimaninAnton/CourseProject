Is this a bug?
I have a model:
class Things(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(verbose_name=_("Name"), max_length=200, null=True)
And in serializer I have to write:
class ThingsSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    name = serializers.CharField(max_length=200)

    class Meta:
        model = Things
        fields = ('name',)
to make the 'name' field required=True.
Update:
To have fields required=True with null=True in models is important because of this reason: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/#postgresql
