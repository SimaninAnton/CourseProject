There is a case to make, that the DB is responsible for writing current timestamps and not the API.
It is common to see DB fields like:
creation TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
DRF doesn't appear to provide any way to avoid sending a NULL field in such a POST (INSERT) call using its serializer with create().
Consequently the DB ruleset (NOT NULL) is violated.
Clearly, auto_now_add=True can be used but it defeats the purpose of letting the DB set the TIMESTAMP upon real record creation time, not at DRF API sending time.
In essence this request asks for a way to alter creation requests from
INSERT INTO t (name, creation) VALUES ("name", NULL) to
INSERT INTO t (name) VALUES ("name").
This way, the DB can take care of setting the correct timestamp.
