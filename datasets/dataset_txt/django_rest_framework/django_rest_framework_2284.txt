Typically I would consider this sort of thing as out of scope, but given the large ecosystem we're encouraging I think this would actually be worth the effort/reward.
Document writing and publishing third party packages.
Include cookiecutter with sane setup.py, runtests.py, MAINFEST.in, tox.ini, .travis.yml etc. etc. to make it super easy for package authors to push a new package.
Right now the barrier to new packages is simply too high. If we could bring that down we could encourage more folks to publish their own base classes, and have a better story when asking tickets for built-in functionality to be closed in favour of a more distributed ecosystem.
