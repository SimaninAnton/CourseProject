I was looking for a way to write tests against live server. In DRF docs there's a page about live testing, but it appears the the section describing RequestsClient() and working with databases ends abruptly.
Steps to reproduce
Go to http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/#requestsclient-and-working-with-the-database
Expected behavior
It would be good see how the sentence and entire section ends
Actual behavior
Section ends in the middle of sentence '...class is useful if'
It looks like something is missing from that section.
