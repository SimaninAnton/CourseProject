Hi Guys,
I'm build rest api application but need help me for case:
enable recursive retrieves
GET api.example.com/user/{user_id}
api.example.com/user/{user_id} – return a user representation
api.example.com/channel/{channel_id} – return a channel representation
api.example.com/user/{user_id}/channels – return a list of channel representations
api.example.com/user/{user_id}/channel_list – return a list of channel ids (or links to their full representations, using the above links)
