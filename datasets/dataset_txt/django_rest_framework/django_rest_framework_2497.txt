My use case:
I like to have uniform exception system in my API's. It is similar to DRF exceptions, but I also like to return name of an error and additional information. In case of invalid parameters was passed by API user It looks like this:
{"error": "ValidationFailed",
 "detail": "Something wrong with the paramters that you passed",
 "field_errors": {"field_one":["This field is required"], ...}}
Currently DRF handles this situation like this:
if not serializer.is_valid():
    return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
So, I want to implement a way to override what generic views do in case of validition errors, to make possible return fancy errors like one that I showed.
