I have the following UserViewSet:
class UserViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = (CustomObjectPermissions,)
    filter_backends = (filters.DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter,)
When using the api browser to view the User list or a User, I get the error DoesNotExist ... ContentType matching query does not exist.
This error does not occur for other viewsets. It appears to be an issue with the django-guardian shortcut get_objects_for_user(). I've read of similar issues and it seems it relates to django-rest passing the permission as unicode (in this case, u'view_user').
