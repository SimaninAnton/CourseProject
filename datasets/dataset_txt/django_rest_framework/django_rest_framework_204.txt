I had the rest URL like(https://marketguru/django/mongodb). I call that URL to POST a record into store various database like Mysql, MongoDB, Mlab. For Post a record I am using only one common REST URL(https://marketguru/django/mongodb). I call that URL from 4 salesforces streaming client at the same time for example[12/mar/2019 10:27:50]. I got a response from only one client remaining not responding. I call that URL from 2 salesforces streaming client at a various time for example[12/mar/2019 10:27:50],[12/mar/2019 10:27:51]. I got a response from both clients. for my knowledge, we call a rest URL at the same time is the problem because we post 4 requests at a time only one request is completing remaining missing. I want to call the common rest URL from various 4 or 5 clients at the same time. how to resolve this problem in Django REST Framework? Any multithreading concepts are there in Django REST Framework? Anyone help me out this problem?
