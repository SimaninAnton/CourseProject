The rest_framework.views.exception_handler method is defined as [1]:
def exception_handler(exc, context):
    ...
Which requires a context parameter that is never used in the method itself. I would suggest either removing the context param, or adding **kwargs instead so no context has to be passed.
Or add documentation as to why it would be needed there or what it even is.
