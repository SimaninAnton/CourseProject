When I make a POST on a viewset with a model that has an EnumField and I use an invalid value for that field, I get the error message
'tuple' object has no attribute 'format'
The reasons seems to be in fields.py:
default_error_messages = {
    'invalid': ("No matching enum type.",)
}
It should be not be a tuple but a simple or translated string.
