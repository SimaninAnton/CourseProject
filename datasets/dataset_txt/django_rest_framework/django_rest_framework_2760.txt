My model contains field 'url' ( in utf-8 ) - it's not url of an model object - it's just a field with any url.
Objects of this model could be created by POST
I used generic view ListCreateAPIView which uses CreateModelMixin for objects creation.
Django raises BadHeaderError when it tries to create Response object (201 created) - due to Response Splitting protection (in django.http.response)
and CreateModelMixin creates HTTP response header with 'Location' = data['url'] :)
So, hardcoded 'url' conflicts with my model field name and it should be great to parametrize it (in settings , for example)
