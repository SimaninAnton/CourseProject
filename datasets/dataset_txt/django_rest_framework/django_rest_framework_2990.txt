I have two model, Post and User, Post have a user_id, I get post list with user by user_id in views get_queryset, set as post.user
And I want to output like
{
count:20
results [
{
"id":1,
"user:[{
"id":1,
"name":"Jack"
}]
}]
}
How to serialize it? I try ModelField and RelatedField, such as user = serialize.Field(source='user'), but not work
