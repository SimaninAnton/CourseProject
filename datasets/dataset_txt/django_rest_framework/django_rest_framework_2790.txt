Example project is located here:
https://bitbucket.org/minder/drf_bug
Steps to reproduce:
Create several (eg. two) Language instances
Create at least one Snippet Instance connected to any of the Languages
Run server and navigate to the api ( http://localhost:8000/api/ )
Filter snippets using id of existing Language - works OK (eg. http://localhost:8000/api/snippets/?lang=1 )
Filter snippets using nonexistant id - returns list of all objects (eg. http://localhost:8000/api/snippets/?lang=999999 )
Expected results:
In step 5 there should be no results.
