The documentation should specify if the failure behavior is for both DEBUG=True and DEBUG=False or that DEBUG=True changes the behavior.
Relevant quote:
HTML error views
Typically a renderer will behave the same regardless of if it's dealing with a regular response, or with a response caused by an exception being raised, such as an Http404 or PermissionDenied exception, or a subclass of APIException.
If you're using either the TemplateHTMLRenderer or the StaticHTMLRenderer and an exception is raised, the behavior is slightly different, and mirrors Django's default handling of error views.
Exceptions raised and handled by an HTML renderer will attempt to render using one of the following methods, by order of precedence.
Load and render a template named {status_code}.html.
Load and render a template named api_exception.html.
Render the HTTP status code and text, for example "404 Not Found".
Templates will render with a RequestContext which includes the status_code and details keys.
