I am going through the tutorial part 5, where function api_root is introduced. Things don't work and an exception "Reverse for 'user-list' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found" is thrown if I don't specify in urls.py name = "user-list" in the proper url assignment as in the following:
url(r'^users/$', views.UserList.as_view(), name = "user-list"),
url(r'^snippets/$', views.SnippetList.as_view(), name = "snippet-list"),
Unless I overlooked it completely, I can't find this step in the documentation. As it took quite a long time for an absolute beginner like me to find out the solution, I thought it was ok to share just in case. Anyway I ask for forgiveness if I am missing something obvious.
