Currently using the Admin Renderer, if you delete an object, you're not redirected on the list page.
The object is well deleted, but code on https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/renderers.py#L717 redirect to a 302 on parent url with a DELETE method, so it breaks.
The returned message is Method "DELETE" not allowed.
It should be a GET on the list page.
