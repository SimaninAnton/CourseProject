I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
Steps to reproduce
The include_root_view and include_format_suffixes appear to be part of the public API surface of DefaultRouter (names are not prefixed with underscore following python convention), but are not documented: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/#defaultrouter
Expected behavior
One (or both!) of the following changes would be great:
Include documentation on these parameters with DefaultRouter
Allow the user to configure them as part of the kwargs of the DefaultRouter constructor
Not including these config options as part of kwargs is trivial to work around for now by doing:
router = DefaultRouter()
router.include_root_view = False
