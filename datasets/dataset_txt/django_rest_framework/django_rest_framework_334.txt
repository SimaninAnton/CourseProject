I'm using the throttling mechanism of DRF. When the exception is shown that actually the request was throttled, one part of the message is translated, the other part is not:
I couldn't find the part "expected available in X seconds" in the translation file so I guess it is just missing?
I'm using djangorestframework==3.8.2.
Best regards
Ron
