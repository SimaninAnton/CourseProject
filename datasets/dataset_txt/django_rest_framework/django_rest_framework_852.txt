After a fresh installation of django and drf, Ive followed the instructions on installing DRF's new docs. When I navigate to the link, the title on the left sidebar is missing even I've added it in urls.py.
When I check the network, I got 401 on /docs and schema.js. I ran collectstatic as well.
Any idea why this is happening?
