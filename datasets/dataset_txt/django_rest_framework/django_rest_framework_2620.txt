FileField (and the ImageField) only show its name currently, rather than the storage url.
AFAIK, name is the string stored in the db; path is the MEDIA_ROOT + name; url is the MEDIA_URL + name.
Only found the same question on the ML. I think it would be convenient if we made this change.
Any thought on this?
