Request must become a subclass of Django's HttpRequest.
.DATA, .FILES, .auth and .method, previously available on views inheriting from RequestMixin will become request.DATA, request.FILES, request.method... Regular attributes on the request (eg. .META etc.) will still be available.
Also, .CONTENT probably needs to disappear and won't be provided by the new Request class.
