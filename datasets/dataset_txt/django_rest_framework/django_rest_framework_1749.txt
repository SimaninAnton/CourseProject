It's taken me quite a bit of reading of the DRF documentation to get some idea what the read_only flag is supposed to do. I think somewhere (but not in the section about the read_only flag) it says that read_only fields will not be treated as fields in model objects and will be ignored when creating or updating these objects. Is that the essence? Could the documentation be updated to explain what it does when you set it?
