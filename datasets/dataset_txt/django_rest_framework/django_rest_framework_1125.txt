I have the following settings:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ),
}
And the simplest API View:
class HelloView(APIView):
    def get_throttles(self):
        throttles = super().get_throttles()
        print(throttles)
        return throttles
    def get(self, request, format=None):
       return Response({'say': 'Hello!'})
When Django DEBUG = False, print(throttles) prints an array of 2 throttle instance.
But when Django DEBUG = True, print(throttles) shows that it's empty!
I browsed through the code and the documentation, I have been unable to understand this behavior nor did I saw any sign of warning.
What I am missing? Should the doc be updated?
