A probable regression has been introduced with DRF 2.3.13
I used to have a field with a unique constraint correctly returned as a 400 with an error message: "Object with this Field already exists."
The PR #1405 (#1257) has removed the validation for optional fields.
This is a big issue as it means that optional fields are simply not validated at all by the model's constraints.
I'll soon open a PR with a test case for this.
