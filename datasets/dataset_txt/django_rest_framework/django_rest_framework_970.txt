I'm struggling with a similar scenario of this issue #3373. I have a very specific service layer that gives a pretty well formed return and my views/viewsets have one job, call this service and serialize its result.
The thing is, I have two serializers, one to validate query parameters and another one to serialize service's raw return. None of them are used as "required" by DRF as serializer_class resulting that their fields won't be considered by SchemeGenerator
I'm failing when trying to create custom documentation to each endpoint, since DRF is kind of model-oriented to generate its schemas (I could write down my own schema, but I would love if DRF generates it for me though), plus I'm using Swagger as interface.
In my opinion, it would be nice to permit create docstring to create coreapi.Documents by that it would be way more flexible. Any ideas how I could proceed for now?
