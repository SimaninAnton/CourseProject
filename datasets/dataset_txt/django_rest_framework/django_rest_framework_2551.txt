It's a pain to have to write a custom pagination class for every serializer. But we currently have to because the "inner" serializer must be specified statically in the Meta class:
class MyCustomPaginatingSerializer(...):
    class Meta:
        object_serializer_class = MyCustomSerializer
It would be nicer to have a single paginator that wraps any serializer, like so:
def my_view(request):
    ...
    serializer = Paginator(MyCustomSerializer(model))
