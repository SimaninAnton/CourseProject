I'm on verssion 2.3.7 and documentation states:
Note: In versions 2.0 and 2.1, the signature for the permission checks always included an optional obj parameter, like so: .has_permission(self, request, view, obj=None). The method would be called twice, first for the global permission checks, with no object supplied, and second for the object-level check when required.

As of version 2.2 this signature has now been replaced with two separate method calls, which is more explicit and obvious. The old style signature continues to work, but its use will result in a PendingDeprecationWarning, which is silent by default. In 2.3 this will be escalated to a DeprecationWarning, and in 2.4 the old-style signature will be removed.
But when i try to use .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj) the method is not runned. The only way to get my custom permission working properly is using has_permission(self, request, view, obj=None) witch is supposed to throw a DeprecationWarning but is actually throwing PendingDeprecationWarning.
