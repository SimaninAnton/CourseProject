Checklist
[ x] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[x ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[x ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[ x] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Any way this can be included in the JsonEncoder? Right now I have to patch the encoder locally to handle Timstamp data. JsonField sometimes includes this data type and when it does, without this patch you get a Timstamp is not JSON serializable

I am using pymongo to fetch the data and it seems to be converting mongodb type Timestamp to a bson.timestamp.Timestamp.
