[x ] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
step 1 . When data posted to apiview , pprint the POST querydict.
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
def snippet_list(request):
if request.method == 'POST':
from pprint import pprint as pp
pp(request.data)
pp(request.POST)
serializer = SnippetSerializer(data=request.data)
if serializer.is_valid():
serializer.save()
return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
step 2 . Post '{"code": "print 123"}' from browsable api to snippet_list apiview.
Expected behavior
result of both pprint : {u'code': u'print 12dgdf3'}
<QueryDict: {}>
Actual behavior
result of both pprint : {u'code': u'print 12dgdf3'}
{u'code': u'print 12dgdf3'}
