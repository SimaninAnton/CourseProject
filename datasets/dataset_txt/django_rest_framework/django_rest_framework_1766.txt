Hi,
Trying to implement any cache systems I have got:
Can't pickle <type 'generator'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.generator failed
Approaches:
serializer = self.get_serializer(query, many=True)

cache.set('current', serializer.data)
cache_page(60)(TheView.as_view())
There is no doc about caching, am I missing something?
Thank you for the DRF
