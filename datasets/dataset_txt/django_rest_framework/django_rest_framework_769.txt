I am using django-compressor to minify my static sources. It seems there's a problem if I try to compress coreapi and schema.js.
When compressing using compress tags:
{% compress js  %}
    <!-- Rest framework JS library -->
    <script src="{% static 'rest_framework/js/coreapi-0.1.0.js' %}"></script>
    <script src="{% url 'api-docs:schema-js' %}"></script>
    
    <!-- Other stuff -->

{% endcompress %} 
Then I get:
/api/docs/schema.js' isn't accessible via COMPRESS_URL ('/static/') and can't be compressed
Therefore, I have to keep these js file uncompressed. What a waste :)
