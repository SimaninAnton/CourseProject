There ought to be a permissions class that simply checks that the current user has the correct model permissions, given the request method and the model set on the resource. Looks like this'd be equivalent to TastyPie's DjangoAuthorization class http://toastdriven.github.com/django-tastypie/authentication_authorization.html
