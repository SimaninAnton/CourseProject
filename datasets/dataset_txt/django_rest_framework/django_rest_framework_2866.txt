Why do PUT requests, using the UpdateModelMixin, allow create actions? What is an example when this is useful? To me, it seems like this opens to door to semantically bad behavior from clients, but I'm sure I'm just missing something :) Can someone explain?
def update(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        partial = kwargs.pop('partial', False)
        self.object = None
        try:
            self.object = self.get_object()
        except Http404:
            # If this is a PUT-as-create operation, we need to ensure that
            # we have relevant permissions, as if this was a POST request.
            self.check_permissions(clone_request(request, 'POST'))
            created = True
            save_kwargs = {'force_insert': True}
            success_status_code = status.HTTP_201_CREATED
