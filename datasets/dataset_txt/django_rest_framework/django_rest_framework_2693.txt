Link to draft release announcement
Headline features include:
Versioning API.
Pagination API, cursor based pagination, controls in browsable API.
Internationalization.
Support for Django 1.8 fields.
ModelSerializer API.
YAML, XML, JSONP, OAuth move into third party packages.
Required
Mark the old global pagination settings as pending deprecation.
Finish documenting pagination.
Figure out if any of the pagination attribute names need to change, and which of the global settings should stay.
Review if #2550 is covered by this work.
Demonstrate how to use internationalization as first section on that page, and in the announcement.
Upgrade deprecation warnings.
Optional
Strip '=' on cursor based pagination.
Ensure we handle None, True, False values on cursor based pagination.
Consider further performance improvements based on benchmarking. (Esp improve the common case for attribute lookup on fields) - Dropped. To be considered for 3.2.
Add example for serializer_field_mappings (and consider allowing partial overrides.)
Decide if DurationField should make the cut, given that we're headlining the 1.8 fields - if we've got this all mostly wrapped up then we could move it in. - Dropped
