Right now SearchFilter expects to load the list of fields that will be searched on from an attribute on the view called search_fields. There is no way to change this without copy/pasting all of filter_queryset and to_html which is not ideal.
I suggest allowing subclasses to change the value along the lines of search_param:
class SearchFilter(BaseFilterBackend):
    # The URL query parameter used for the search.
    search_param = api_settings.SEARCH_PARAM
    search_fields = 'search_fields'
This change will allow using SearchFilter multiple times on the same view but having different fields searched.
