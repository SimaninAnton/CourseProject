Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question.
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library.
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request.
Steps to reproduce
Create a subclass of BasePermission and add it to permission_classes for a view set.
Try to access an instance within the view set.
Expected behavior
Access should be denied, because the permission has not been granted, that is, it has not been assigned to any users.
Actual behavior
Access is allowed.
This is counter to OWASP recommendations, and makes it unfeasible to maintain a complex security model.
