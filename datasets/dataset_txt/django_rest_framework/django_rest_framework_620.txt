Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Looks at the 3.7.0 release notes
Notice #5354 is not referenced anywhere.
Expected behavior
Ideally, there would be an entry noting a breaking change on something like SchemaGenerator().get_serializer_fields(...) since it is now a part of AutoSchema. For my use case I went from:
generator = SchemaGenerator()
return generator.get_serializer_fields('/', 'POST', view)
to
generator = AutoSchema()
generator.view = view
return generator.get_serializer_fields('/', 'POST')
however I needed to go through the issue tracker and recent PRs to find that this was the solution.
Actual behavior
The changelog should have a correct reference to the breaking change and the solution to fix it.
Also, thanks for the awesome work you guys do!
