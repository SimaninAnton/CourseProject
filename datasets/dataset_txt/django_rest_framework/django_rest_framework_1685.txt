The error message given by a serializer ChoiceField when a choice is invalid isn't HTML-safe:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/0ccb148183ac56eccbd2ac488402f3f075019bbd/rest_framework/fields.py#L1133
A request submitting an invalid value to a ChoiceField will see that value reproduced verbatim in the error message. This means that if the invalid value contains <script> tags, an attacker could inject and potentially execute code on the page.
Given the simple nature of this bug, there may be other instances of this vulnerability in DRF. I'll submit a pull request for this one shortly, but there might be more - worth keeping an eye out I think.
