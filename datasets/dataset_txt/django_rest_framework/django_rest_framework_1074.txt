http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39191676/drf-serializer-with-generic-foreign-key-check-if-given-object-id-exists-before - it seems that there isn't any "native" way of doing such, and also there isn't any way of accessing the content_object in a validator (because serializer.save() isn't called, therefore content_object has still null value at that point), and I can't do a comparison or a check of that selected object.
Is there a possibility to make doing such things easier?
