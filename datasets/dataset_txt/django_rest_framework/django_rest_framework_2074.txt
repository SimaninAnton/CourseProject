We're seeing folks ask about ResultDict and ResultList objects a fair bit on the mailing list, although they're most just an implementation detail that they don't need to know about.
We should probably modify the representation of them to simply be the standard native styles, such as {'a': 123} and [1,2,3]. Hiding this bit of detail will likely lead to less confusion.
