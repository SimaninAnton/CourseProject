I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
If someone is having his patterns like this:
patterns = [
    url(r'^test/objects/', ExampleListView.as_view()),
    url(r'^test/(?P<pk>\d+)/objects/', ExampleListView.as_view()),
]
or
patterns = [
    url(r'^test/(?P<slug>\w+)/', ExampleDetailView.as_view()),
    url(r'^test/(?P<pk>\d+)/', ExampleDetailView.as_view()),
]
Schema generated by the SchemaGenerator will be (thats for first case):
Document(
    url=u'',
    title='Swallowed list view',
    content={
        'test': {
            'objects': {
                'list': Link(
                    url=u'/test/{id}/objects/',
                    action=u'get',
                    fields=[
                        Field(
                            u'id',
                            required=True,
                            location='path',
                            schema=<coreschema.schemas.Integer object at 0x107798210>
                        )
                    ]
                )
            }
        }
    }
)
Expected behavior
All links included in the schema.
Actual behavior
Because of the way how links are implemented (dictionary), if there are multiple detail views, list views and possibly others, they get replaced in get_links() step in SchemaGenerator.
