I tried this but it seems that it doesn't work this way.
class MyViewSet(ModelViewSet):

    # .... other code

    @detail_route(methods=['get'],
                  url_path="some-thing",
                  serializer_class=SomeThingSerializer)
    def some_thing(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response(self.get_object().some_things())
I wasn't able to find it in the documentation either. If it is not supported, treat it as a feature request.
