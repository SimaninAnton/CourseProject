I am experimenting with list fields of serailizers. I can able to get list fields of Integers, CharFields and others which will be list, but I am in the need of List of List fields.
I tried some thing like this
list_filed = serializers.ListField(child=serializers.ListField(child=serializers.CharField(max_length=20)))
But I am getting error when I am giving the input data like
list_filed = [["aneesh"],["Kumar"]]
I am getting the below error, can any help me
int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'list'
