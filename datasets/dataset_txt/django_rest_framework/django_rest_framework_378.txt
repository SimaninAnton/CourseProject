I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
When a user logouts immediately after logging in (requests for data are pending) It shows unauthorized . I happens because data request are made after token is destroyed. I think there should be some case for handling this scenario.
Steps to reproduce
Login to API (I used Angular 4 as front end) and logout immediately . Logout before data requests are not completed.
Expected behavior
It should log out without any error,
Actual behavior
A "Unauthorized " message is returned.
