I noticed that recently a lot of packages are moving away from the core to different repositories. While I think that is the right way to go, the packages are kind of drifting away in various directions. Of course, I can read the documentation to find the links, but as a casual user I can't just poke around Github and find them. The framework is getting bigger, has docs, a website and now a growing network of packages.
For example, this is Django's organization.
Why I thought it is important now, is because before all the links and package repos have settled down it might be a good idea to think about. You can start throwing shoes at me now :)
