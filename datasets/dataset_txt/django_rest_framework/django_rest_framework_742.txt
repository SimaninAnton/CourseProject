Is it possible to have the request throttling code to run before running authentication? Or have it run even if authentication fails?
Current scenario: Endpoint with authentication and throttling enabled, endpoint can still be abused with unauthenticated requests since it will skip throttling. This might not seem important, but if authentication is something like basic or api key, someone could technically brute force that endpoint if it doesn't have throttling until it gets a response.
