Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
>>> from stories.serializers import QuestiongroupSerializer
>>> serializer = QuestiongroupSerializer()
>>> print repr(serializer)
<stories.serializers.QuestiongroupSerializer object at 0x3165490>
Expected behavior
From http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#inspecting-relationships
>>> from myapp.serializers import AccountSerializer
>>> serializer = AccountSerializer()
>>> print repr(serializer)  # Or `print(repr(serializer))` in Python 3.x.
AccountSerializer():
    id = IntegerField(label='ID', read_only=True)
    name = CharField(allow_blank=True, max_length=100, required=False)
    owner = PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=User.objects.all())
Actual behavior
As mentioned in the steps to reproduce.
