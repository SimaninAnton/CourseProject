Hi,
I noticed this inconsistency, where it's explained here that one can register a ViewSet passing a base_name will override the view names for "detail" and "list".
But here it says that "By default hyperlinks are expected to correspond to a view name that matches the style '{model_name}-detail' which contradicts the info above.
I checked the code and it does what it says on the tin.
Shouldn't everything respect the base_name used when registering the url?
