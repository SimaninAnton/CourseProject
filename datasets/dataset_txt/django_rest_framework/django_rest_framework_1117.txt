this seems odd to bind the return of get_page_size to self.page_size rather than page_size:
class CursorPagination(BasePagination):
    page_size = api_settings.PAGE_SIZE

    def paginate_queryset(self, queryset, request, view=None):
        self.page_size = self.get_page_size(request)
...
    def get_page_size(self, request):
        return self.page_size
It is inconsistent with how the other Pagination classes work. For example see PageNumberPagination:
page_size = self.get_page_size(request)
This change was made in: c879aaf.
I would say this makes understanding how these classes works a lot harder given the various mutable states.
