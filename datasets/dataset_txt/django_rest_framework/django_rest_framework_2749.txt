Let's look at the section on testing: http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing.html
I'm told to use APIRequestFactory. Okay then, what now?
The import location, rest_framework.tests.APIRequestFactory is located after numerous code examples, approximately 75% inside.
On the same page, encode_multipart is called but there is no import or source provided.
Solution
For core Django, I suggested that the first time any object is used on a page, an import is made. This turns even topical documentation into really useful reference documentation. I submit that django-rest-framework do the same.
