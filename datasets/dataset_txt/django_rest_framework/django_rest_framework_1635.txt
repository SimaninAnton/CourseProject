I think help the API be more self-documenting if @detail_route allowed for a customizable title and description in the browsable API. Currently, the detail_route just takes the name of the model for the title and uses the description provided in the viewset. Perhaps the name of the detail_route method could be the default title, and a comment block for that method could be its default description.
