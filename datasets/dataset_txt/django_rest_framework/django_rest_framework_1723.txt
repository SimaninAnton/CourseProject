It would be nice if there were an option, that PrimaryKeyRelatedField adds a _id suffix to the field_name on the serializer.
For example, if there is a user model with a relation to a profile, then the serializer should return:
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "FOO",
  "profile_id": 1
}
instead of:
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "FOO",
  "profile": 1
}
This has the advantage, that the client using the rest api can set the attribute profile on the returned object. At the moment this is not possible.
I was able to get this behaviour in my project with django rest framework 3.1.3, but I had to use a lot of undocumented stuff. So it would be nice if this feature could be implemented in core.
