Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Define ViewSet with detail_route method with at least two http methods:
class ExampleViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    @detail_route(methods=['put', 'post'])
    def custom_action(self, request, pk):
        pass
Generate schema:
        schema_generator = SchemaGenerator(title='Restrictive API')
        schema = schema_generator.get_schema()
Expected behavior
Both PUT and POST methods in resulted schema.
Actual behavior
Only one method in generated schema.
