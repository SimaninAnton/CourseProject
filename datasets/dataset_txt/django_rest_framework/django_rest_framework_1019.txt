I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Instantiate a serializer with data=None and then access the errors attribute
serializer = Serializer(data=None)
serializer.errors # <-- this will raise 
To add more context to how I discovered this issue, try doing something like this on an actual project:
curl -d 'null' -H "Content-Type:application/json" <your-endpoint>
I couldn't reproduce this with the ApiTestClient because it will transform None into an empty string... So my unit tests were passing.
I could reproduce it using the Django test client though.
I guess this is probably a different topic and should go in another issue/convo.
Expected behavior
a proper ReturnDict should be returned by serializer.errors
Actual behavior
A ValueError: too many values to unpack is raised.
