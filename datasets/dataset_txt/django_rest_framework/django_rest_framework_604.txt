I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Have a decimal field named score with decimal_places=1
Serialize an objet with a score attribute that has a value of Decimal('7.25')
Expected behavior
Output shows 7.3
Actual behavior
Output shows 7.2.
The behaviour does not match human expectations and DecimalField does not accept a rounding parameter (for the Decimal.quantize method).
It seems overkill to install something like django-rest-framework-braces to work around one missing param in the API.
