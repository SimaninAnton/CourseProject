I create a barebones ModelSerializer for a model with a required ForeignKey to User. Intending to set the relation in perform_create I add the field to the read_only_fields Meta attribute.
If I do nothing else I get an AssertionError as the auto generated field is:
PrimaryKeyRelatedField(read_only=True, required=True)
OK. Rightly this doesn't make sense.
But I here need to declare the PrimaryKeyRelatedField in order to set required=False manually. Better would be that setting read_only=True makes required=False.
No problem at all putting a test together for this. I haven't looked re a fix.
