Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
My repo at this commit morenoh149/djangoRestFrameworkTutorial@480e116
Expected behavior
Working through the tutorial - part 2 at the end of the section we should be able to get snippets in json and html format.
Actual behavior
Instead I get
â–¶ http http://127.0.0.1:8000/snippets.json  # JSON suffix          
HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
Allow: POST, OPTIONS, GET
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 20 Jun 2016 19:22:55 GMT
Server: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.10
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
I thought adding @csrf_exempt would allow the endpoints to function as before but it did not change the outcome.
