When a implement a new authentication method and call a view with IsAuthenticated permission and user not is authenticated, django rest framework raises:
  File "XXX/site-packages/rest_framework/views.py", line 206, in check_permissions
    self.permission_denied(request)
  File "XXX/site-packages/rest_framework/views.py", line 80, in permission_denied
    if not self.request.successful_authenticator:
  File "XXX/site-packages/rest_framework/request.py", line 362, in __getattr__
    return getattr(self._request, attr)
AttributeError: 'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'successful_authenticator'
Seen code, I think is incorrect. Where is "self.request.successful_authenticator" I think should be "request.successful_authenticator".
Views.py, near line 80.
def permission_denied(self, request):
    """
    If request is not permitted, determine what kind of exception to raise.
    """
    if not self.request.successful_authenticator:
        raise exceptions.NotAuthenticated()
    raise exceptions.PermissionDenied()
