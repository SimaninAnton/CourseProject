after 8b73dce the url field is created and set in __init__
This basically overrides the 'normal' method for customizing fields by explicitly setting them (like the example in the docs do, http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers.html#hyperlinkedmodelserializer)
So now the url field can't be customized anymore (well, except for the view_name and lookup_field parameters)
