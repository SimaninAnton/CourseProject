### Checklist
[x] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[x] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[x] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[x] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[x] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[ ] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
### Steps to reproduce
It seems to have a comma 'Forgetting' in this section:
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/renderers.py
Line 951 in 0f5dfe8
 schema['title'] = instance.title, 
Indeed, when I generate the OpenAPI schema, the title property isn"t a String as expected.
### Expected behavior
title property must be a string
