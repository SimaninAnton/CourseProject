To allow versioning in headers, as suggested in the doc, I have a custom content type "application/vnd.foo+json; version=1.0". Unfortunatly I can't benefit from the shortcut Response.json() when I use this header because I'd get the exception:
*** ValueError: Content-Type header is "application/vnd.foo+json; version=1.0", not "application/json"
