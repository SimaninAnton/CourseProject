There's my Example:
class Class(models.Model):
    level = models.CharField(u"Level", max_length=20)


class Student(models.Model):
    cls = models.ForeignKey(Class)
    name = models.CharField(u"name", max_length=20)
And there's the serializer:
class ClassSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Class

class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    cls = ClassSerializer(many=False, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Student
And I have a normal ViewSet for this.
When I GET /api/student/, everything is OK, Student's cls field show as JSON dict.
But I want POST /api/student/ {cls: 1, name: John}
It prompt me Field cls required.
What's wrong with it?
I tried set read_only=False, the /api/student/ accept Class field, but I don't want this, I want POST cls_id only. What can I do?
