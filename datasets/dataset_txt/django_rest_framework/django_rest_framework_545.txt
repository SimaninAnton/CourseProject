The update method on ModelSerializer calls instance.save(). I'm proposing that this should be changed to something like instance.save( update_fields=validated_data.keys( ) ) to ensure only the patched fields are updated. Of course, any m2m fields will need to be plucked out.
I'm currently overriding the update method in my own code to workaround a race condition where two simultaneous requests update different fields on the same model. If both serializes have loaded the model instance before either gets to update, whichever serializer hits update last will overwrite the first serializers update.
