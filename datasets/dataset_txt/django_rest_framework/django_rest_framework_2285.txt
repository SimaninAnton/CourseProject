With 2.3.14 an regression has been introduced that caused an AssertionError to be raised when a ModelSerializer was used on a model with ForeignKey fields marked as required and not editable.
This has been almost but apparently not entirely fixed with 2.4.4. Now when a model instance is created, the object refered to with the ForeignKey field is not assigned to the model instance before validation in the serializer. In my case this causes a lot of DoesNotExist exceptions because the it's assumed that these attributes exists as they would after saving the model instance.
Now I don't feel very strongly about whether this should be supported or not. It should be clearly documented though and I would like to know whether I should fix this on my end (and how) or whether this is going to be fixed in the framework.
