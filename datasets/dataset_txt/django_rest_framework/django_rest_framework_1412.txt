Following the documentation of ListField, a user may expect that it is to be declared as:
field_name = ListField(NestedField())
This looks quite natural and in consistency with former drf-compound-fields.
However, the implementation expects the child to be specified in kwargs rather then args. This prevents a child to be specified as first arg and requires declaration to be:
field_name = ListField(child=SubField())
Which is a bit confusing.
Te same applies to DictField.
