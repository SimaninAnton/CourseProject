It wasn't totally obvious to me from the custom authentication docs that an exception message is used in the response (unless there is DRF configuration to turn this off?).
This is an important detail because my inclination in Python is to raise exceptions with detailed information and that could give an attacker clues about how to break my authentication.
It would be great to amend the ExampleAuthentication code with this note:
When this example code raises an AuthenticationFailed exception, the request will result in a 401 response containing the exception message. It would look like this this if you're using a JSON encoder:
{"detail": "No such user"}
