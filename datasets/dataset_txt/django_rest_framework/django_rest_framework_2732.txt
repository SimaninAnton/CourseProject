On some GET parameters I want to return model objects created dynamically on the fly in my view - they are not actually saved in database, thus they have no PKs.
Let's say I do this just for convenience to abstract some stuff of the same kind, which is not actually in database.
The problem is that URL field is then populated with URL even in case the PK is None:
{
    "url": "http://example.com/api/somethings/None/",
    ...
}
I think it should be just null (in case of JSON response), therefore expected behavior is following:
{
    "url": null,
    ...
}
On some other GET parameters I am listing proper objects saved in database, therefore I want the url attribute present in results, I just want to indicate that "on the fly" objects have no url available, no URL exists with details for such object.
