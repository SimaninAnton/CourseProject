I am trying to expose a bunch of existing forms which have extensive validation and handle update/create in their form.save() method.
Some of the forms are quite complex, and represent not just one model object, but for example one "entry" and many related "answers".
I'm hoping to keep all of this logic in the form, where it can be re-used by both the web application and the API.
I'd like to see a FormSerializer class in DRF, which behaves similarly to ModelSerializer, in that it will introspect its fields from a form class instead of a model class.
I'd also like to see complimentary CBVs that will take care of serialising form validation errors.
All this would allow me to much more easily open up an existing application with an API by re-using the logic.
