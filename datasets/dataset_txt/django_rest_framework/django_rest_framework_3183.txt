Tests
Add 'format' attribute to Renderers.
Modify can_handle_request so that if self.view.kwargs.get('format', None) == self.format, then True
Ensure that format in kwargs wont screw anything else up
Support these styles by default in the html renderer, in preference to the &accept= style.
&format= style should also be supported. Ensure format in params wont screw anything else up (see accept, csrfmiddlewaretoken, etc... in resource.py) ie accessing self.PARAMS should ignore format.
Added points (yes please) - ensure the html renderer can be super clever and coerce urls it finds into format appended urls if it is itself a format appended url. EG. If a given url has both an HTML browseable api, and a standard HTML rendering, then we can use something like '.api' for the browseable api urls, and '.html' for the standard urls.
