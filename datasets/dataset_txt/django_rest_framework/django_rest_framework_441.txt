I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[ x This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Implement a serializer with a serializermethodfield that returns a dictionary.
Expected behavior
This dictionary should be serialized as is.
Actual behavior
The dictionaries keys end up in a totally random order than the order you specify them in.
