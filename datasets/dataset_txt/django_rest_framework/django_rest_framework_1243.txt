I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Hi! I coded this third party project for DRM. It is a real-time messaging solution composed of three packages. Would you link to it from the Third Party Packages section? Thanks!!
I think it would fit under the Misc section:
django-rest-messaging, django-rest-messaging-centrifugo and django-rest-messaging-js, a real-time messaging service using DRM. See doc and demo.
