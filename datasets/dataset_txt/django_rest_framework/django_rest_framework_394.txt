I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
I found a caching guide in the source code while looking for how DRF deals with caching. This guide was added in #5514.
I would hope to find this guide in the "API Guide" list.
Actual behavior
The caching guide is not on the documentation site.
I think the problem is that it's missing from the mkdocs.yml file.
