I have a simple CRUD application. It seems to me that, DRF silently fails during HTTP PUT in 3.3.2
For example, the following code is in my views.py.
elif request.method == 'PUT':
    print "Request data in HTTP Put ",request.data
    serializer = AlSerializer(alert, data=request.data, partial=True)
    if serializer.is_valid():
        print "data seems to be valid in HTTP PUT"
        if serializer.data['token'] == user_token:
            print "saving the seriaizerd data in PUT"
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data)
        else:
                return Response({'error': 'Not allowed to access'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
As you can see, I am trying to access serializer.data before save. In version 3.3.1 , I explicit get an error. But in 3.3.2 , I guess that's not the case.
In both cases settings.py has DEBUG = True
