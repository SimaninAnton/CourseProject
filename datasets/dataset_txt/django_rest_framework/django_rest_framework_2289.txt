In our API we use djangorestframework-camel-case to make undescored names camelcased and vice-versa. In real-life requests everything is fine, but when I try to test API with DRF's APIClient, I can't get camel-cased names to be underscored (in response). Seems like APIClient has TEST_REQUEST_RENDERER_CLASSES setting, but misses TEST_RESPONSE_PARSER_CLASSES one (compared to DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES / DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES).
