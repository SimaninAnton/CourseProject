I made a SO post about this here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32123148/writable-nested-serializer-with-existing-objects-using-django-rest-framework-3-2
Even if it turns out nothing is broken, I think a documentation update would be helpful for this case (a nested write that also uses existing objects). In addition, it seems like the source attribute isn't respected by the SlugRelatedField serializer, at least on writes.
