I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
in a serializer, have a MultipleChoiceField with the following four choices: '1', '2', '12', '}'
in the HTML form representation:
select choice 12
submit
(see #4119 for an exact test case)
Expected behavior
Choice 12, and only that one, is shown as selected.
Actual behavior
All four choices are shown as selected.
