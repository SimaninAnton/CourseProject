I believe we should be adding @jpadilla to the team due to continuing contributions.
However, as part of this we should also be looking at codifying the management process.
We should ensure we have a 'Maintainers' section in the contributing docs that covers.
How maintainers are added. (At the moment I'd be fine with folks raising a ticket to signal interest)
Who has docs & PyPI rights.
For maintainers, brief guidance on how to upload new releases/docs.
For maintainers, brief guidance on triage.
