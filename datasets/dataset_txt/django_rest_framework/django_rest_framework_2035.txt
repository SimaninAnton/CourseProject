In authentication.BasicAuthentication.authenticate_credentials,
shouldn't the raised error message be "Inactive user" instead of "Invalid username/password", in case of inactive user?
    if user is None:
        raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed('Invalid username/password')
    elif not user.is_active:
        raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed('Inactive user')
Because i spent some time understanding how my credentials could be wrong...
Anyway, thank you for this powerful tool!
