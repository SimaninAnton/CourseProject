Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a model serializer with no fields in the meta and a read only viewset (this is only needed because of the browsable API).
Expected behavior
An exception should be raised when this endpoint is accessed saying that you should pass a fields value.
Actual behavior
If there are no resources (and the viewset is readonly or format isn't api) get_fields() isn't called, which in turn doesn't raise the AssertionError.
While this should be caught by proper tests, a naive test that just hits the endpoint to make sure the configuration is correct will not catch this error.
P.S. I've not included a test because I'm not sure this should be considered an error, but if you think it is, I can easily do it.
