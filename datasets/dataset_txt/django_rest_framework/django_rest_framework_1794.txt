Many people have posted questions about the best way to hook into API views to add logging, e.g., https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-rest-framework/n7iZK2l4VB0. I've done this myself in a couple projects now, so I made a reusable app that implements the recommended strategy and saves the data to a db model:

If this package would be useful to others, it could be added to the docs somewhere. Not sure where would be best, though.. maybe here?
