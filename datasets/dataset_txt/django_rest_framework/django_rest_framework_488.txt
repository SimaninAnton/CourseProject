I'm using Django Rest framework. (DB = MySQL)
I want to import another table's row count.
[article table]
articleNo(Primary key)
userkey
content
likeCount
[like table]
articleNo(FK to article)
userkey
For example, articleNo == 1, counting number of row in a like table and storing article table's likeCount column.
All I want to know is about "like table", particularly suitable for a certian condition that counts values in table and list it to "article table"
Can it be implemented with Rest framework?
Thanks.
p.s. As I'm a non-native English speaker, it would be very appreciated if you use plain language to help my understanding.
