I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a user with a leading and/or trailing spaces in their password (User.objects.create(username='foo', password='bar '))
Attempt to authenticate/validate the user through AuthTokenSerializer (AuthTokenSerializer(data={'username': 'foo', 'password': 'bar '}).is_valid())
Expected behavior
Validation succeeds
Actual behavior
Validation fails
