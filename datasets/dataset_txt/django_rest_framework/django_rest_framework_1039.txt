I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[n/a] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Try to serialize a nested relationship without related_name defined
Expected behavior
Should work as related_name is optional... Defaults to FOO_set if I'm not mistaken.
Actual behavior
Nested field is ignored.
Either should fix code or document dependency.
