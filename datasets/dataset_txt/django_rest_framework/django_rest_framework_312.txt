This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.

Steps to reproduce
I just implement APIView in view module of my Django App and adding IsAuthenticated into this class
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView


from v1.twit_app.serializers.user import UserSerializer

User = get_user_model()

# users
class UserView(APIView):
    @staticmethod
    def get(request):
        """
        List users
        """
        users = User.objects.all()
        return Response(UserSerializer(users, many=True).data)
But error always be acquired
