I found it is really ugly and hard to override create method in a subclass of ModelSerializer, is it possible to add such feature in release 3.0?
And I think it is very useful for such scenario, when I use django.contrib.auth.models to handle user authentication, but also need to add some more fields to user's profile, so we need a one to one field to link these two tables.
Thanks for your good job!
