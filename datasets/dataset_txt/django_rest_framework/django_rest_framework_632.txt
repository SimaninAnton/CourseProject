I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
In testing an application against Django 2.0a1, I ran into a confusing error:
  File ".tox/py36-django20/lib/python3.6/site-packages/rest_framework/serializers.py", line 30, in <module>
    from rest_framework.compat import JSONField as ModelJSONField
  File ".tox/py36-django20/lib/python3.6/site-packages/rest_framework/compat.py", line 26, in <module>
    from django.core.urlresolvers import (  # Will be removed in Django 2.0
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django.core.urlresolvers'
After investigating, it is related to a shim for older Django versions which now breaks as of Django 2.0a1:
try:
    from django.urls import (
        NoReverseMatch, RegexURLPattern, RegexURLResolver, ResolverMatch, Resolver404, get_script_prefix, reverse, reverse_lazy, resolve
    )
except ImportError:
    from django.core.urlresolvers import (  # Will be removed in Django 2.0
        NoReverseMatch, RegexURLPattern, RegexURLResolver, ResolverMatch, Resolver404, get_script_prefix, reverse, reverse_lazy, resolve
    )
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/compat.py
Line 28 in 607e4ed
 NoReverseMatch, RegexURLPattern, RegexURLResolver, ResolverMatch, Resolver404, get_script_prefix, reverse, reverse_lazy, resolve 
It turns out, RegexURLResolver no longer exists. I would imagine this is related to the new simplified URL patterns.
I'm unsure what the exact fix is at this moment, as I haven't dug into the new url implementation(s) yet, but I do recall that the old regex functionality is being maintained.
