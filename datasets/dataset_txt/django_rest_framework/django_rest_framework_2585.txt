I was getting a 'RelatedManager is not iterable exception' and was able to trace the source of the error back to lines 441 - 448 of serializers.py. The code there is as follows:
if update:
       # If this is a bulk update we need to map all the objects
       # to a canonical identity so we can determine which
       # individual object is being updated for each item in the
       # incoming data
       objects = self.object
       identities = [self.get_identity(self.to_native(obj)) for obj in objects]
       identity_to_objects = dict(zip(identities, objects))
when I change the line objects = self.object to objects = self.object.all() everything seems to work fine, though.
