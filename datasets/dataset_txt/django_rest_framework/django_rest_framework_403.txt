Would be nice if detail_route or list_route woudl allow to disable schema generation
by setting arg schema=None.
    @detail_route(
        methods=['get', ],
        schema=None,
        ...
    )
At the moment I have to build separate view
class MyViewSet(mixins.ListModelMixin, viewsets.GenericViewSet):
    ...
    schema = None
    ...
