I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
The permissions class:
class Test(permissions.BasePermission):

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if view.action in ['retrieve','update','destroy']:
            return True
        return False

    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        return False
Expected behavior
Should result that no user is able to 'destroy' or 'DELETE' an instance
Actual behavior
The 'DELETE' button is showing in the web interface, and deleting is avilable.
