In the HTML response type, the HTML title is always the same, simply: "Django REST Framework".
As I'm working on my API, this is a minor nuisance, and I'd bet it's an easy fix to simply put the h1 value in there too, so it's:
Django REST Framework &ndash ObjectType List
I could probably take a stab at this if this was a welcome improvement.
