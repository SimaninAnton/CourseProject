I am missing an easy way to (re)generate tokens for a (query)set of users.
I came here to make a pull request, but thinking about it I would like input from the community on whether my thoughts are far out, and I should pull myself together and create each token with a separate save.
From my investigation I have concluded that this could be fixed by moving key generation to the constructor, and thus making it possible to save a bunch of new tokens with Token.objects.bulk_create().
This raises the question of why the key generator method is not static or a class method.
It could arguably be made static or a class method, but when discussing with myself, I conclude that then it would be hard to override with a custom method that needs access to self.
This is however also infeasible as long as Token is not based on an AbstractToken class.
