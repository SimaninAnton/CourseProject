Hi,
I need to use this regex
[a-z]{10}
in list_route decorator.
Here's my code:
@list_route(methods=['GET'], url_path=r'tickets/(?P<ticket_id>[a-z]{10})')
def ticket(self, request, ticket_id=None):
    return Response(cache.get(ticket_id, {}))
Somehow it raises a problem below
.../lib/python3.5/site-packages/rest_framework/routers.py", line 254
trailing_slash=self.trailing_slash
IndexError: tuple index out of range
Then I checked the official code of rest-framework, it uses {xxx} and format to expand url and feed to django regex parser. I guess that is why my regex doesn't work. Hope If this problem can be fixed.
Environment:
python @3.5.0
Django @1.9
Django-Rest-Framework @3.3.3
