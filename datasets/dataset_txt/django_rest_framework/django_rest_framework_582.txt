Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
While upgrading, I noticed the release notes for the latest release isn't published in the docs, although it is there in the source. On RTD, 3.7.2 is also missing.
Hopefully, that's just a minor issue, but I thought I'd notify about it in case something is broken in the build.
Expected behavior
There should be a section for the 3.7.3 release.
Actual behavior
Section is missing.
