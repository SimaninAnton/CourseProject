Hi,
I have this issue open on drf-nested-routers:
alanjds/drf-nested-routers#45
Basically, exceptions in a NestedSimpleRouter is not picked up by the rest_framework.views.exception_handler, and so neither by any custom exception-handler either.
I think the problem is with drf-nested-routers, but creator @alanjds does not think so. This issue is a bit above my level, so I thought I'd see if anyone here can point me in the right direction.
Cheers!
