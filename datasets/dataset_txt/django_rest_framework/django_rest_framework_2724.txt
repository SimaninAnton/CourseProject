The error occurs when serializer is set with partial=True and has field-level validation defined on a field, for which there's no corresponding value in data.
I have written a test to cover this scenario. Will submit it in a PR.
Note this issue was mentioned in Issue 965, which is closed. Nothing, however, was done on solving the issue.
