See this project - I know django-rest-framework is an open source repo, but I thought you guys may want to be aware that someone's pretty much just copied the status.py and added a setup.py, with an invalid project license.
Up to you if you guys want to poke the guy, but it's worth noting that their repo appeared in the Import Python newsletter, and as an open source dev myself, I wouldn't want it being misattributed.
