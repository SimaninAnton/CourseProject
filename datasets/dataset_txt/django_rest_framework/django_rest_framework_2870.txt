Hey all,
Just ran into the following error in a Django 1.3 project:
TemplateSyntaxError at /survey/api/v1/stores/
Caught NameError while rendering: global name 'force_bytes' is not defined
Seems to come down to compat.smart_urlquote trying to use force_bytes at line 424 without importing first.
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/3774ba3ed2af918563eb6ed945cc13aa7fa2345a/rest_framework/compat.py#L424
Looks like force_bytes wasn't added until Django 1.4, so it may take some fiddling to get working.
