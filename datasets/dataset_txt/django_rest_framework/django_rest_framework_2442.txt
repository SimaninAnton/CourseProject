Currently the ChoiceField serializes to_native through its base class which causes it to return the first of the choice tuple. This is what Django does. There should be an option to use the "get_FOO_display"-function type of behaviour (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.get_FOO_display) to get ChoiceFields to serialize the human-readable form in native.
