class A(Model):
    pass
class B(Model):
    a = OneToOneField('A')

class ASerializer(Serializer):
    b_id = PrimaryKeyRelatedField(source='b', null=True)
Now when an A is serialized, it will not have B's id, but its own. I believe this is due to this erroneous line in PrimaryKeyRelatedField. Once I remove that line, the correct value for b_id will be serialized.
