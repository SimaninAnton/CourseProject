Checklist
[+] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[+] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[+] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[+] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[+] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Attempt to include the Query Parameter (e.g. specific level) in the serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField.
Expected behavior
URL with www.api.com/group/?level=Specific_level
Actual behavior
Unable to include the respective query parameter as a variable when trying to generate an URL using the serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField i.e. could only output www.api.com/group.
Could utilise the django.urls.reverse() but it would be useful if there was an extension to the serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField that would enable the inclusion of the query parameters into the automatically generated URL
