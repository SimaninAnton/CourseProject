This is not a bug report, it's a feature request ;)
I want to have a ViewSet that allows me to save multiple objects at once. I tried something like this:
class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer(many=True)
    model = Product
this raises error because serializer_class becomes an instance not a class and cannot be instantiated. I then tried to hack it by fiddling with serializer's __init__ - it allowed me to POST multiple objects, but I was unable to GET a single one.
Same problem goes for fields. I modified the serializer class but I can't use this atribute because serializer_class does not accept instances.
I know I can write each method separately but I think the way described above would be pretty awesome/KISS/DRY.
