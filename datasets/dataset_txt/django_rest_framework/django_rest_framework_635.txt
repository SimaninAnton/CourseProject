In preparing #5448 I noted that documentation.py is essentially undocumented. There is a basic usage example for include_docs_urls in the Documenting your API topic page, but that's it.
We need documentation for the three functions:
include_docs_urls
get_schemajs_view
get_docs_view
This would help users wanting to customise the defaults here.
