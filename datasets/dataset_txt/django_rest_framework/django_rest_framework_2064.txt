Hi all,
Currently, I'm developing a API for an french open-source project and I would like to order the results according to a field in a foreign key.
I have a Profile class which has a foreign key to User. Like the search, I would like to make:
class MemberListAPI(ListCreateAPIView, ProfileCreate, TokenGenerator):
    """
    Displays the list of registered users or create one.
    """

    queryset = Profile.objects.all()
    filter_backends = (filters.SearchFilter, filters.OrderingFilter,)
    search_fields = ('^user__username',)
    ordering_fields = ('user_username')
But to order my results, I must make this request:
http://localhost:8000/api/membres/?ordering=user__username
and not:
http://localhost:8000/api/membres/?ordering=username
Anyone can help me?
