I just found a really odd issue. I create this repo to reproduce it: https://github.com/BraisGabin/drf_upload_raw_test
With the code: https://github.com/BraisGabin/drf_upload_raw_test/tree/it-works both tests work ok. They are exactly the same. The only change is the image.
If I add 'TEST_REQUEST_DEFAULT_FORMAT': 'json', to the settings file one of the tests fails, the other doesn't. (You can check it in the master).
Is this an issue? Or am I missunderstunding something?
