Currently according to this:
Add these to your root URLconf if you're using the browsable API and
your API requires authentication:
urlpatterns = patterns('',
...
url(r'^auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
)
The urls must be namespaced as 'rest_framework'
Because of this.
Any reason to now allow the user to override the rest_framework:login so that a pre-existing end point can be used for login and logout?
