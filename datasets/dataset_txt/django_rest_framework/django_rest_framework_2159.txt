Hello,
I'm sorry if this is a common question, I've run through the docs and some of the issues here and couldn't seem to find a solution to this.
I recently used django-rest-framework, and it is great. However, I have no idea on how to make it work with the existing users (the ones created before rest-framework was set up). Any new users can login successfully, but any other users created before the user of rest-framework will get a 400 Bad Request error.
The odd thing is, these accounts work if I use the rest-framework's own API brower on my app, but it doesn't work anywhere else (external API browser, mobile app, etc), except for the users created after rest-framework is set up.
I've done all the migrations and nuking the database is not an option since we have quite large amount of existing users.
Is there any way to solve this? Thanks!
