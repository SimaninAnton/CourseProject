I am writing the tests for my project.
# tests.py 
class customeTests(APITestCase):
    def setup(self):
         # some code
  
    def test_checkAPostRequest(self):
           url = "some_url"
           response = self.client.post(url, header="some_header", data="some_data")
           # Further code

# views.py
class SomePostView(CreateAPIView):
     def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
           # custom logic
##########################
When I run my tests, I get an error saying that
SomePostView must either include a serializer_class or override get_serializer_class()
Why is this happening? I checked the API on postman. It's running fine.
FYI - It's only happening in views where I haven't specified a serializer_class (used custom logic instead)
