I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Post a multipart/form-data content-type request to a DRF MultiPartParser view.
One of the multiparts contains the content_type text/json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=------FormBoundary15a13bb0cf2
Content-Length: xyz

------FormBoundary15a13bb0cf2
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="json"
Content-Type: text/json

{   "x": "3" }
------FormBoundary15a13bb0cf2--
Expected behavior
request.data['json'] as json dict
Actual behavior
request.data['json'] is a unicode string
multipart entrys are not parsed with any DRF Parser.
At the moment i manually parse the JSON part, but i think the parts should be automatically parsed by DRF to support Clients Content-Type header.
