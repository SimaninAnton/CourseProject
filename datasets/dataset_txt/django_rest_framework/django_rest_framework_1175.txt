Some of these may already be covered, but we should make sure that all the following are satisfied:
If a user declares a field explicitly, but also includes it in extra_kwargs then warn/error.
If a user declares a field explicitly, but also includes it in read_only_fields then warn/error.
Don't allow get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs to override a declared field.
Don't allow get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs to override a flag that has been set in extra_kwargs.
If a serializer field has a default, then ensure that uniqueness validators use that for empty, rather than forcing required=True
