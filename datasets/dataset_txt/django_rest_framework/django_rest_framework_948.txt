Checklist
[ x ] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[ x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[ x ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[ x ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[ x ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Call get_schema_view with patterns=something and you get an error because it is not defined.
get_schema_view(title=None, url=None, renderer_classes=None):
     generator = SchemaGenerator(title=title, url=url)
link
but SchemaGenerator object allows:
class SchemaGenerator(object):
    def __init__(self, title=None, url=None, patterns=None, urlconf=None)
Expected behavior
Be able to call get_schema_view with patterns.
I don't know why it is not allowed given that the SchemaGenerator object that is instantiated allows patterns to limit the inspected urls.
Actual behavior
TypeError unexpected keyword argument
