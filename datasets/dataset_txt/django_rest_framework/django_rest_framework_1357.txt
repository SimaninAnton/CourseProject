I spent a good while documenting what I thought was a bug before finding #2547 and I have a question.
Say we have a model with
user = models.ForeignKey(User, blank=True, null=True)
...
Meta:
    unique_together = ('user', 'foo')
And a ModelSerializer for said model. With or without
user = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(required=False, allow_null=True)
Without the user field set (or set to null) we would get "user": [ "This field is required." ]
Adding default=None to the serializer removes the unwanted validation error. Is this intentional? "Null values are not considered equal." At least as postgres defines it in uniqueness checking. I would expect the serializer to accept a null user value.
