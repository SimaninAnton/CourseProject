While reading through the documentation again, I noticed that due to multiple ##Examples in the docs markdown for viewsets.md and relations.md, the side-nav links for all 'examples' link to the first 'example' occurrence on the page. Rather than open a pull request, I'm sure you would like to handle the changes on this small bug in the way you see fit (rename the examples or make them ###Example, etc...)
