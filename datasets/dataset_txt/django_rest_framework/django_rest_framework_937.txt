Checklist
[*] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[*] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[*] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[*] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[*] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError as DjangoValidationError
from rest_framework.serializers import ValidationError

error = DjangoValidationError('Sample error message', code='error_code')
drf_error = ValidationError(error.error_list)

drf_error.get_full_details()
Expected behavior
The error message should be rendered correctly as follows:
[{u'code': 'error_code', u'message': u"Sample error message"}]
Actual behavior
The message is assumed as a tuple/list and then force_text() renders it incorrectly.
[{u'code': 'error_code', u'message': u"[u'Sample error message']"}]
