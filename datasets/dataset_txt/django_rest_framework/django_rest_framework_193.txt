This issue occurs when using the updated OpenAPI schema generation by @carltongibson (#6532).
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Run ./manage.py generateschema on any project that has an API endpoint that inherits from GenericAPIView and does not have a serializer_class.
Expected behavior
A normal OpenAPI schema, except the request and response parameters should be empty? Maybe with a warning. I am not sure whether this should raise an exception or handle those cases.
Actual behavior
Traceback (most recent call last):
