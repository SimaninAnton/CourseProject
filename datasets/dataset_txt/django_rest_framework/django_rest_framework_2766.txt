It looks like BooleanFields get a default of False and because of that they can't be required. So doing this has no effect:
foo = serializers.BooleanField(required=True)
I'm pretty sure the problem is this in rest_framework/fields.py BooleanField definition:
    # Note: we set default to `False` in order to fill in missing value not
    # supplied by html form.  TODO: Fix so that only html form input gets
    # this behavior.
    default = False
