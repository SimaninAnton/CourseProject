verbose_name and help_text are descriptor fields on model classes, which can be used for generating nice forms and descriptors. Django Forms contain them as label and help_text, which are also automatically read from model class (in case of ModelForm).
rest_framework.fields.Field and ModelSerializer should support them as well.
