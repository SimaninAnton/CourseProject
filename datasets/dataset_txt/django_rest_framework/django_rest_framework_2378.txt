Hey Tom,
I was wondering if it would be possible to add allowed_methods to the response of the OPTION HTTP request describing the allowed HTTP methods on the resource. I know that it is possible to override the metadata method in generic views but I think it makes sense to include allowed_methods by default.
Thanks,
Alex Nimmer
