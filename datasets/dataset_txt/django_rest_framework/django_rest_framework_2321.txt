General style & usage tips etc. Including:
Good API style.
querysets and select_related, prefetch_related, only.
DB indexes, particularly wrt filters, relationships, view lookups.
Model encapsulation.
Thin serializers, thick models.
Avoid mixins where possible.
Don't set instance attributes on views.
