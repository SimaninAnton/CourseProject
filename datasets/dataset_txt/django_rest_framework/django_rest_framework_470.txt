I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Suppose you have multiple model managers on class B, a FKey relation on class A to class B like:
    b_data = BSerializer(many=False)
Expected behavior
Without editing the models.py by defining a default, this should be possible from the serializer point of view.
Actual behavior
DRF by default selects the default_manager
