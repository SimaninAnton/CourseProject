Let's say I'm working on an endpoint to represent Photos, and who have a CopyrightHolder. (Meaning, Photo has ForeignKeyField with null=True for the CopyrightHolder)
My serializers would be like this:
class PhotoSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
     copyright_holder = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(view_name='holder-detail', required=False)
     class Meta:
           model = models.Photo
I believe that validation works correctly, but unless I'm missing something, the generated form does not allow me to edit a photo without setting a copyright holder.
