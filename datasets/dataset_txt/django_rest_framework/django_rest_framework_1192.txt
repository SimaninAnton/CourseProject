I have a protected-url, I use authentication_classes = (JSONWebTokenAuthentication,), when I add a Authorization: xxx header:
 curl -H "Authorization: JWT <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/protected-url/
It return 401, work fine.
But, when delete Authorization: xxx and visit it directly.
 curl  http://localhost:8000/protected-url/
I got a 200 (a empty result ), It is a proteced url, I want it return http 401.
