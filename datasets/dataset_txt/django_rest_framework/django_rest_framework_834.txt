I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a View with a custom ApiSettings with EXCEPTION_HANDLER specified
Trigger an exception and notice that the custom exception handler isn't triggered because the APIView class only ever uses rest_framework.settings.api_settings.
Expected behavior
View uses self.settings since views can override settings objects so easily.
Actual behavior
Uses default handler instead
Extras
The 3.4 series used self.settings.EXCEPTION_HANDLER but 3.5 moved to use get_exception_handler which started using rest_framework.settings.api_settings.
