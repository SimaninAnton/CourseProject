sessionid in Django is HTTP_only, and recommend to be HTTP_only
And default authenticate backend of Django/Restframework is SESSION BACKEND, that means request must include seesionid(stored in cookie) to be used to authenticate a use,
So, when i send a AJAX request, the sessionid would not be included in request, because JS can not get sessionid in cookie(HTTP_only), and server would never authenticate user since can not find sessionid in request.
How could i make it right?
Should i set sessionid could be get by JS(the way Django do not recommend)?
PS:
User login in site with form, and send a AJAX request in specify page
