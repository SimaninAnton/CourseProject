I've written a custom throttle based on SimpleRateThrottle and have currently written a test similar to that in test_throttling (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/tests/test_throttling.py#L62).
Is there a better solution? My throttle limits are much higher than 3 which results in my tests taking a while to run.
I'm wondering if there's a way to set a cache value directly and make a single request to return a 429. I recognize this is likely more of a Django question than a DRF question.
