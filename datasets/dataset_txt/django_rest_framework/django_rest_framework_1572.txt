As per discussion on #3315, it would be nice to pull the Django Filter related code out of DRF.
I'm happy to pull this into Django Filter itself. There's already an issue there to add a more DRF friendly base FilterSet class. It makes sense to combine the work into one.
Moving the code is simple enough â€” it should require a no more than a change of import for end users. Other queries: test coverage boundaries; docs.
