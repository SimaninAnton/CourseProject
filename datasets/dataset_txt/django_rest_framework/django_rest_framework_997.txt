I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
$(form).serialize() serialize checkbox with no value to "on" or "off"
Expected behavior
Add "on" to TRUE_VALUES and "off" to FALSE_VALUES
(I don't always have the control over html/js to add value to checkboxes).
Actual behavior
Value is ignored
