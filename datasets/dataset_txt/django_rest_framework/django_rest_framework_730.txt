I found it very usefull for frontend apps to set page size via query param when using CursorPaginator. I am attaching PR for that that is basically adoption of of PageNumberPagination approach inside CursorPaginator.
Disclaimer: I decided to leave both max_page_size and offset_cutoff as they are serving different semantic purpose (even if feels very similar).
