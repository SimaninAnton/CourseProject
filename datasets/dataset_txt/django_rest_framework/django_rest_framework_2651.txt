Previously, with page_size=0 parameter, it returned [{},{},...] style of results but now returns like this,
{
    "count": 7, 
    "next": null, 
    "previous": null, 
    "results": [{},{}...]
}
which of course breaks backward compatibility and there's no way to update our all client mobile apps at once.
I don't know why you didn't offer an option in settings to turn on and off the new behaviour to give developers enough time to catch up with the change.
