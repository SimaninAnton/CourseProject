The .model attribute on views is a shortcut for .serializer_class and/or .queryset.
It's usage is currently discouraged in favor of the more explicit style, but we should probably deprecate it entirely. It creates undesirable implicit behaviour, and is a potential point of confusion.
Removing it would create a simpler very explicit style in the generic views that's feels like a further step in the right direction to me.
This would also allow us to remove the DEFAULT_MODEL_SERIALIZER_CLASS setting.
