DRF has the following code:
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/compat.py#L164-L172
It relies on markdown.version. In Markdown 3.0, which was published a few days ago, that no longer works, and it throws an attribute error.
I filed Python-Markdown/markdown#711 in hopes that it'd get resolved in Markdown, but I'm filing this bug so that everybody is aware of the issue.
