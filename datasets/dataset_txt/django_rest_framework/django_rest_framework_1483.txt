I'm have use the DRF to project, and need to create serializer fields, to parse and validate local data (e.g: in Brasil is CPF, Zip Code, etc), and create a project to this, based in django-localflavor, the drf-localflavor-br.
But, I'm thinking if it is interesting create a localflavor to DRF too. What do you think about this?
