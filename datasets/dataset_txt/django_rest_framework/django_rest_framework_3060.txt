The following dictionary:
{
    '10x10': 'http://example.com/images/image-10x10.png',
    '20x20': 'http://example.com/images/image-20x20.png'
}
will be rendered into invalid XML (element name starts with digit):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<root>
<10x10>http://example.com/images/image-10x10.png</10x10>
<20x20>http://example.com/images/image-20x20.png</20x20>
</root>
According to the spec, a Name is a token beginning with a letter or one of a few punctuation characters, and continuing with letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, or full stops, together known as name characters: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/07/25/namingparts.html
