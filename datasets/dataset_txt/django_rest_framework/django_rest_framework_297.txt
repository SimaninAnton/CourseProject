I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[n/a] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[n/a] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
The statement from django.conf.urls import url, include needs to be changed to from django.urls import path.
Steps to reproduce
Run the sample code in docs/tutorial/5-relationships-and-hyperlinked-apis.md, specifically the last snippets/urls.py code block.
Expected behavior
It produces no error messages.
Actual behavior
Error message:
NameError: name 'path' is not defined
