Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
You can verify this bug, if you use any cache backend with your project.
Expected behavior
TokenAuthentication should always check whether a request made is authenticated or not, before returning any response!
The authentication mechanism should work irrespective of the project.
Actual behavior
Given, a user has configured Caching in the settings.py file and we are fetching some large datasets from the database using Django ORM, then Caching bypasses the TokenAuthentication scheme.
The previously cached query is returned.
