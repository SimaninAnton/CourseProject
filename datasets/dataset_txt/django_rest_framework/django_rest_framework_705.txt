Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
ListField signature in docs is misleading. It implies that child argument can be passed as positional arg. However ListField.__init__ pops child from kwargs.
>>> from rest_framework.fields import ListField, CharField
>>> ListField(CharField()).child
Expected behavior
CharField()
Actual behavior
_UnvalidatedField()
