I wrote a functional test that verifies that I can get all users from the /users/ endpoint.
I am comparing my list to the deserialized list that I got from response.data['results'] and all of them lack ids.
This is because of https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L305
Now for the rest of the readonly fields I can create a custom serializer for the test but the id won't be serialized back.
