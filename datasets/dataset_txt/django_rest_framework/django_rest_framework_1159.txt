Checklist
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
I want to use get_serializer method in GenericAPIView, so I create CBV inherited from GenericAPIView without queryset attribute, all ok in json, but in BrowsableAPIRenderer get_queryset called in get_filter_form and assertion raised.
