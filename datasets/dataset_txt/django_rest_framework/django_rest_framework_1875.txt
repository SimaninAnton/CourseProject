A HyperlinkedRelatedField with a source argument generates the wrong url. For example,
class UserSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    customer = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(
        read_only=True,
        view_name='customer-detail',
        source='userprofile')

class CustomerSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Customer

class CustomerViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = CustomerSerializer
    etc...
If user.userprofile.pk == 5, and userprofile.customer.pk == 7, the generated url will be http:/.../api/customer/5/ instead of http:/.../api/customer/7/, having taken the pk from the intermediate model instead of the desired relation.
I'm not sure if this is by design and 2nd degree hyperlinked relation aren't supported, but couldn't find any mention in the docs. As a workaround I'm able to nest the Customer in the UserSerializer, but thought I'd mention this.
Thanks!
