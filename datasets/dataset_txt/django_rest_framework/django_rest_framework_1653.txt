I use the CamelCaseJSONParser (https://github.com/vbabiy/djangorestframework-camel-case) so that I can post CamelCased keys from the client but retrieve them as underscores in python. It would be nice if we can transform query parameters as well.
In other words, a request with query params ?pageSize=100 could be retrieved in python with request.query_params['page_size'].
I'm wondering if this is something DRF should consider handling? Is there a way to do that currently in userland?
