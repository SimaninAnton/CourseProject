Hi,
I'm having the following problem with relative hyperlinked fields when I try to create a resource:
{"resource":["Invalid hyperlink - Object does not exist."]}
Assuming that the link is as follows: http://localhost/api/resources/10/
When I make a GET to the API it returns me the object, but when is a relationship with the resource it returns me the error noted above (the relation in the database exists)
Thanks
