I'm using IE9's XDomainRequest to make a request to a DRF api and I'm getting a 415. I understand when sending an XDomainRequest we can't send a custom content type header but only text/plain. We noticed there is a way to override the content type using a form field (FORM_CONTENTTYPE_OVERRIDE). Is there a way to do it in the url instead? Alternatively, is there an easier way to tell DRF to handle my request as x-www-form-urlencoded, or do I have to provide a custom negotiation class?
