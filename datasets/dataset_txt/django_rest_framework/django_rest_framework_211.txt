When going through the testing guide for the first time: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/
I immediately hit the issue that my django postgres user didn't have permission to create the needed test database: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/
I think it would be helpful if a small note was added to the testing docs about this so new users could be informed about this potential obstacle.
