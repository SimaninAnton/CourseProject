Currently (AFAIK) all resources have to be updated via PUT with all data.
If not all data is not supplied then rest of the fields will be set to None.
Sometimes it is very handy to just send a fraction of the resource, that have changed. [ resources that have lots of M2M & FK fields ]
Consider CRM, with employee and M2M field with 300 customers. If I would like to change the name of the employee I would do PATCH { "name":"John"} and omit the unchanged data.
maybe there should be a PATCH handler, for partial updates?
AFAIK

has implementation of PATCH, also based on Forms
