I usually implement my APIs by including a "self" URL and other related URLs in the serialization of each object. This allows for data structures in my APIs that are consistent and therefore more easily parseable.
An example:
/users/:
[
    {"username": "john", "url": "http://.../users/1"},
    {"username": "paul", "url": "http://.../users/2"},
]
/users/1:
    {"username": "john", "url": "http://.../users/1"}
I don't see a documented method for doing this. It seems like it may be non-trivial if the full path URL reverses in rest_framework.reverse were used because the serializer would need access to the request object.
