When clients interact with servers with CORS enabled, preflight OPTIONS requests are sent by the client to POST endpoints, among others, without authentication. This is according to the CORS spec. The spec also states that all preflights should be responded to with a 200 OK.
Currently, rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated return False in all cases when there are no authentication credentials. This makes DRF incompatible with CORS.
Users wanting to use CORS on their website have to subclass IsAuthenticated like so
class IsAuthenticatedAllowOptions(IsAuthenticated):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
            return True

        return super().has_permission(request, view)
Can I suggest either the default IsAuthenticated be modified to do this, or perhaps to add a IsAuthenticatedCors class?
