I was able to speed up deserialization by 10 - 15% by replacing the stdlib's OrderedDict with https://github.com/shoyer/cyordereddict (Python 3.4, DRF 3.1.1). Is it worth supporting cyordereddict as an optional package? The only change would be in compat.py:
-try:
-    from collections import OrderedDict
-except ImportError:
-    from django.utils.datastructures import SortedDict as OrderedDict
+try:
+    from cyordereddict import OrderedDict
+except ImportError:
+    try:
+        from collections import OrderedDict
+    except ImportError:
+        from django.utils.datastructures import SortedDict as OrderedDict
I'm happy to prepare a pull request.
