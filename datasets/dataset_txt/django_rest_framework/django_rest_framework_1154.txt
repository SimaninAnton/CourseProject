Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a ModelViewSet with a custom permissions class that requires request specific data to pass/fail.
Go to the Browsable API for this ModelViewSet, there is no handy form to test POST requests.
Expected behavior
The list endpoint should show a form to test POST requests.
Actual behavior
It appears that DRF tries to introspect the Permissions class to determine whether or not the user "has permission" to send POST requests, and then renders it accordingly. This is a bad assumption, since often custom permissions are request specific (meaning, they depend on the data sent in), not just who is performing the request. DRF should display the form as long as POST is an allowed method.
