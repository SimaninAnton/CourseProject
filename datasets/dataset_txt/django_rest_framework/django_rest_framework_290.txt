While trying out the new composable permission feature, I have the following problem:
>>> IsAuthenticated & IsStaff | IsAuthenticatedWithTwoFactor & IsCustomer
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/code.py", line 91, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'OperandHolder' and 'OperandHolder'
>>>
It seems that is posible to compose like
(IsAuthenticated | IsStaff) & IsAuthenticatedWithTowFactor
but compose two composed permissions will not work :-(
