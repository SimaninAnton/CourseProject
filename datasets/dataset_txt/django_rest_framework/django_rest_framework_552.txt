Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Expected behavior
The quickstart tutorial suggests creating new apps inside project directory. It admits that it's unusual. As a django/djangorestframework beginner, I expect a link to another section in the document, or an external source explain that suggestion.
It may look unusual that the application has been created within the project directory. Using the project's namespace avoids name clashes with external module (topic goes outside the scope of the quickstart, you can see more here).
Actual behavior
The tutorial states the topic goes outside the scope of the tutorial without providing a link to a further explanation
