The README Example's UserSerializer definition has an error. It includes a 'url' field that does not exist in a default Django User model. When following the current Example (with the 'url' field) an error is thrown:
'ImproperlyConfigured at /users/
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "user-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the lookup_field attribute on this field.'
Removing the 'url' field from the UserSerializer definition fixes this.
