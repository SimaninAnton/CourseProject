PR #1788 broke a test using a plain string match on the rendered HTML from the Browsable API.
A link to my comment on the commit for later
These kind of test are always horrible but we should be able to make changes to the formatting of the HTML without breaking them.
I'd like to move to a selector based approach (or such).
