Noticed that decorators such as permission_classes and throttle_classes do not function on standard routes (create, list, update, destroy, etc.). Hope they could be used like those for function based views, or another decorator like detail_route or list_route which accept arguments of those classes. Adding permissions or throttles for a certain view function is a fairly common use.
