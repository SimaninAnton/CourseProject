It would be nice to have some support for versioning APIs.
My first thought was to define different namespaces when creating urlpatterns, like "api-v1", "api-v2". It makes no difference if you make all versions of api in different apps ir in single one. It even doesn't make difference if somone prefers to have absolutely different URI for each version or define version other way.
I made that this way in my project but I lost a lot of "magic" that happens i ModelSerializer - i had to define explicitely all serializer relations (HyperlinkedRelatedField, HyperLinkedIdentityField) because serializers could not make reverse resolution to views in namespace. I think it would be nice to have ModelSerializer namespace/version aware. Maybe some attribute declared in Meta?
