Hi, I'm using djangorestframework==3.3.2 and when i try to set my fields as required rest-framework ignore it.
This is my field
questions = serializers.DictField(required=True)
rest-framework setting to {} and pass the validation, i had to create my own validator for fix it. I dont know if just happened to me or is a issue in the code.
this is my fix:
def validate_questions(self, value):
        if value:
            return value
        else:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("This field is required.")
thanks for your attention.
