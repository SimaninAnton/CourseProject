While a CharField is containing no unicode (i.e. non-ASCII), I see it in YAML API nicely:
full_name: Miro Hroncok
However, if it contains non-ASCII chars, I get:
full_name: "Miro Hron\u010Dok"
While the following would be much nicer (and fairly loadable by PyYAML):
full_name: Miro Hronƒçok
I have a fix in mind.
