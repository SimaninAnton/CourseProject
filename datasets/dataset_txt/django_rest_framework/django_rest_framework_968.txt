Steps to reproduce
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    user = models.OneToOneField(User)

class DeveloperViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    search_fields = ['userprofile__name', 'email']
Expected behavior
You can also perform a related lookup on a ForeignKey or ManyToManyField with the lookup API double-underscore notation:
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter
OneToOneField should work like ForeignKey as a related relationship.
Actual behavior
Raise Cannot resolve keyword "userprofile" exceptions.
