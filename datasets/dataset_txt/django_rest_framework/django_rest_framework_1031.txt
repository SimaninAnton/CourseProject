As I read Django REST framework 3.4 announcement page I found "realtime support". We are using django rest framework for API. Actually I am looking to work in realtime in django-rest-framework. I tried to find in website for realtime support page but not found. Can you please give me that realtime support reference URL or suggestion?. Thanks in advance.
