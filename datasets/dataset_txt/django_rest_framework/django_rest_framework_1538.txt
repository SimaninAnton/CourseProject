BooleanField.TRUE_VALUES and BooleanField.FALSE_VALUES cannot currently be imported before settings.configure() has been called. It would be great if these constants could be accessed before configuration.
Our use case is that we have utility functions for conditionally changing responses based on query string params. We want to use the same truthy/falsy values defined by BooleanField. These utility functions may be imported before settings.configure() is called. Current workaround is to copy and paste the values.
This change can be made without breaking compat; I'd be glad to make a PR if the maintainers give the go-ahead.
