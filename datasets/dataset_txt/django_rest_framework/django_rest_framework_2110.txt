Feel free to treat this as a question or an issue against docs.
In DRF 2.4.4, we were able to do this:
class BidViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    ...
    def get_queryset(self):
        qs = super(BidViewSet, self).get_queryset()
        return qs.filter(user=self.request.user)
to call ModelViewSet.get_queryset() while overriding it.
In DRF 3.0.2, we get this error:
AssertionError: 'BidViewSet' should either include a `queryset` attribute, or override the `get_queryset()` method.
from b3253b4.
Do we need to go back to:
    def get_queryset(self):
        return Bid.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)
or what's the (new) preferred way to reference the canonical model declaration for a ModelViewSet? Maybe return self.Meta.model.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)?
