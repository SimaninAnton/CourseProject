When using the browsable API, it isn't finding the static files that make it look pretty. You can see what it looks like without the CSS and JS files:
These are the 404 errors I get in my log:
I am using a virtual environment with virtualenv. It's looking for the files in /local/dev/src/rest_framework/, whereas they are actually located at /local/dev/src/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/static. This is simply where it was installed using pip install djangorestframework from inside my virtual environment
I do have rest_framework in the INSTALLED_APPS of settings.py.
Any ideas on directing the framework to the correct location?
