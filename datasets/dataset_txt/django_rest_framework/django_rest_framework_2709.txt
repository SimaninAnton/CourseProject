It says:
Because ModelViewSet extends GenericAPIView, you'll normally need to provide at least the queryset and serializer_class attributes.
But I can also use the model attribute and create a ModelViewSet that does not need a serializer:
from app1.models import Dish

class DishViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    model = Dish
I consider that even less than providing at least the queryset and serializer_class attributes.
