Hi guys,
I've just updated to the latest version(2.3.7) and was exited! It is awesome!
My question is:
Can I specify permission_classes per view in ViewSet?
I want allow ALL users to create instances, but only AUTHENTICATED can view them.Please see code below:
class MyModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    authentication_classes = (SessionAuthentication, )
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated, )

    model = MyModel
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer

    def retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        #retrieve code goes here

    def update(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        #update code goes here

    @decorators.action(permission_classes=(AllowAny, ))
    def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        #how to allow UNAUTHENTICATED users access the url?
I use the approach registering customers. Is there any feature that can help me? The code above actually not working, it checks only "IsAuthenticated" permission, so only authenticated users can access "create" view.
