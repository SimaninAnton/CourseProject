Validation errors coming from model with __all__ key should be merged with non_field_errors list.
Consider example model:
class Foo(models.Model):
    # fields ...
    def some_validation_before_save():
        #...
        raise ValidationError("Some Error")

    def full_clean(*args, **kwargs):
        super(...).full_clean()
        self.some_validation()
When serializer.is_valid() is called custom validation errors will be returned with a key __all__ while ValidationError raised from serializer.validate() will expose non_field_errors list. I belive that __all__ errors should be merged with non_field_errors isn't it?
