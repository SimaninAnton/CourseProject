Why is 'get_authorization_header' in 'authentication.py' a function, not a method of 'class BaseAuthentication' and 'class TokenAuthentication'?
A problem has occurred in some applications.
It works fine in other views, but in certain views
'Request.meta' does not include 'HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'.
(Of course, 'WSGIPassAuthorization on' is set.)
I do not know the exact cause yet, but this is probably a client issue.
I had to solve the problem by using HTTP_X_AUTHORIZATION instead of HTTP_AUTHORIZATION.
Is it impossible to change the class to be able to call the 'self.get_authorization_header' method in the class?
