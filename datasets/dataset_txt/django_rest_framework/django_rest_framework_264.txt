Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Description
I'm trying to generate a json-formatted openapi schema with the generateschema command, but the format option seems to be completely ignored. I also tested it with the 'corejson' format, with the exact same result (stack trace suggesting that options.format was not correctly parsed from the command invocation)
Steps to reproduce
python manage.py generateschema --format openapi-json
Expected behavior
A json-formatted openapi schema is printed to stdout
Actual behavior
(note: I intentionally did not install pyyaml so that this would illustrate the erroneous behaviour. The second-to-last frame is the most relevant one)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./manage.py", line 15, in <module>
