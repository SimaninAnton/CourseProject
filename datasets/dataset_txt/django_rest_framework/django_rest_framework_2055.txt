As far as I can tell, by default CSRF protection is removed from APIView for the convenience of the developer, since providing a CSRF token requires a little extra work.
It is an important enough security feature to be enabled by default in Django, and I am having trouble finding any explanation in the rest_framework documentation or otherwise as to why it is disabled by default. In the absence of any concrete justification behind its removal, I would like to see a feature to re-enable it (perhaps via a setting)
It is easy enough to do CSRF protection for AJAX POST requests -- in fact is is baked into core Django already:
