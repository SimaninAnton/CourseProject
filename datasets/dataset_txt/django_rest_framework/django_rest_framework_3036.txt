documentation requests the following argument:
queryset - All relational fields must either set a queryset, or set read_only=True
In practice however, when using for instance ManyHyperlinkedRelatedField, without queryset an exception is thrown:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'all'
Also, I'm not sure I understand the meaning of these fields, would love to have a more elaborate documentation on why we need a queryset or read_only
