Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
create like example in your doc
def get_serializer_class(self):
    if self.request.user.is_staff:
        return FullAccountSerializer
    return BasicAccountSerializer
Expected behavior
The schema must be generated
Actual behavior
Error 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'user'.
All because when a schema is creating in the get_serializer_class self.request = None
I'm not sure but it looks like a bug #5198. I think it will be useful
