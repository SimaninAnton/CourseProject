Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Define custom DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS in Django settings.py
Expected behavior
DRF uses Django's DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS when parsing dates
Actual behavior
DRF uses ISO_8601 datetime only for parsing (e.g. 2017-08-23T12:04:11Z)
