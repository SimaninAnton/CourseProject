In some of my Serializer classes I take advantage of extra_kwargs to change some of the behavior of the fields auto generated by the ModelSerializer. I like this approach relative to being explicit and specifying the field because that way if I make changes to the Model those changes are picked up automatically (DRY).
That being said there does not seem to be any way to specify the class used for the field. Right now that class is resolved from serializer_field_mapping. My use case is that I want to use a subclass of the standard CharField Serializer for one of my fields. I would prefer to not have to explicitly specify the full field including class for the reasons mentioned above (for example if the max length changes on the model, I would like to pick up the change).
I suggest adding field_class as a valid option in extra_kwargs.
