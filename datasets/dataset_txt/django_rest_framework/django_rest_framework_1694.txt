Hi,
We have a case now where new client-code expects camelCased data-keys wrapped in jSend format, but we still have to maintain a historical api.
So, using generic, class based views, is there a way to parse the serializer data just before returning the response?
Just thought I'd check before we look into forking.
Cheers.
