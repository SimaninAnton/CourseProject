Hi.
In this issue #1332 you've been discussing raising 404 for endpoints where user doesn't have permissions for reading it.
@tomchristie offered to use DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter and i think it's absolutly correct. But if you see DjangoObjectPermissions
implementation, there is 404 response for such requests. I found it confusing, because user "should has no permissions" for viewing resource that "is exists". I think 403 is more correct for such requests. What do you think about it?
