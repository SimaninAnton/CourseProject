I have a ViewSet list_route that is setup for GET using query parameters. The CoreAPI schema generator does not include these serializer fields in the schema but I think they should be considered for inclusion (although I'm not entirely sure how one would go about determining that )
I know that filter_fields will be included in the schema, however, essentially this list_route is more of a RPC action related to the collection, rather than an action that returns a list.
class ExampleViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    ...
    @list_route(methods=['get'], serializer_class=SpecificSerializer)
    def specific_list_action(self, request):
        serializer = self.get_serializer(data=request.query_params)
        ...
