I'm upgrading an application using from version 2.4 and it looks like the serialization was changed from bottom-up (simpler objects were instantiated before complex objects) to top-down (simpler objects were instantiated after complex objects).
This causes issues since the create functions on complex objects do not get actual models from their dependent objects.
This gist has an example of this behavior.
Is this change desired, or are we experiencing a strange corner-case that we need to work-around or fix.
