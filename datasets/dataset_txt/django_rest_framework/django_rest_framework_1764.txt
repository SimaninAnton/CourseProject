In the browsable API, when using the "HTML form" tab, there is no way to omit a given value. Leaving the value as blank is not the same as omitting. For example, I have an uuid field that the user can chose to omit (ie not send). If the user does send that value, it is expected to be a valid UUID (ie a blank UUID is not valid).
The current work around is to just use the "raw data" tab and construct the payload manually.
For reference this is:
{
 "id": ""
}
vs
{
}
and the Serializer looks like:
PersonSerializer():
    id = UUIDField(required=False, validators=[<UniqueValidator(queryset=Person.objects.all())>])
