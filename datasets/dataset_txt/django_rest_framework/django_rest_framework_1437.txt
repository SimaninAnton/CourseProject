This is a follow up of #3629
Somehow, if I add mixins.CreateModelMixin to the view class, see below:
class GoPermissionViewSet(mixins.CreateModelMixin, mixins.ListModelMixin, mixins.RetrieveModelMixin, mixins.UpdateModelMixin, mixins.DestroyModelMixin, viewsets.GenericViewSet):
Above is effectively the same as extending viewsets.ModelViewSet
That, will cause the view to go through all the user records (in my case 1+ million).
The work around is to manually specify a custom user serializer
class GoPermissionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = UserSerializer()

    class Meta:
        model = GoPermission
What it seems to me is the CreateModelMixin is playing up with User model.
