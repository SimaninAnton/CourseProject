We currently have two APIs managed by Django REST framework in the same Django project: an AJAX API and a REST API. They are in two separate apps.
Some settings can be set per view, like the authentication classes and permission classes. We take advantage of this by using a root view for each app, where we set those. For example, the AJAX API auths with Django sessions, while the REST API uses an access token.
We would like the versions of both APIs to evolve independently, but can't, since ALLOWED_VERSIONS is a global setting. Would a pull request that allows setting the allowed version per view be accepted?
Thanks!
