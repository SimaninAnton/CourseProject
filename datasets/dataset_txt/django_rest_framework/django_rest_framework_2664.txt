I (and maybe others) will have a bit of time during December/January for DRF related matters.
The main difficulty is staying on top of where we're at. It would be really good if @tomchristie could find an hour or so before then to review the Roadmap. (This hasn't been edited in 7 months, and a lot has happened since then.)
I like seeing what's been crossed off but what's pressing now? And where's the latest discussion on that? What are the goals for 2014?
