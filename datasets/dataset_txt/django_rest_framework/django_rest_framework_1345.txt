Consider the following model and serializer:
from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100)

    class meta:
        unique_together = ('title', 'slug')


class ArticleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    def validate(self, attrs):
        attrs['slug'] = slugify(attrs.get('title'))

    class Meta:
        model = Article
As you can see, the Article model has a unique index on its two properties. When a request is made to create one, the serializer checks the unique constraint before calling validate. As a result, once the slug has been changed in the validate function, it's possible to get error 500's. (Duplicate slugs can be generated in this situation because they strip punctuation, making "great" and "great!" the same.)
Now I realize this isn't necessarily the most practical example, but it gets the idea across about changes in validate not being considered.
