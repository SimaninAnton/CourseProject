Not sure if this is something I'm doing or not, but here's the scenario. If I add an entry to my nova app urlpatterns like:
url(r'^hypervisor/spawns[/]?$', SpawnsAggView.as_view())
I can send a request like this: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nova/hypervisor/spawns?interval=5m to the running server, and get a non-404 response back.
If I use client.get in an APISimpleTestCase, I get a 404. If I adjust the pattern to remove the $, like so:
url(r'^hypervisor/spawns[/]?', SpawnsAggView.as_view())
then the test will return a non-404 status. Seems like the $ should only be applied to the path, but might be including the query string as well.
