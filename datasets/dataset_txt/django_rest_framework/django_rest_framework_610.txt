I've digged a little bit & seen that in rest-framework/utils/html.py, list values from form data are handled inside parse_html_list function. In my case i wanted to use a different notation:
Instead : [0]foo : 'test'
I wanted to use .0.foo : 'test'
I'n the parse_html_list i've replaced re.compile(r'^%s\[([0-9]+)\](.*)$' % re.escape(prefix)) with re.compile(r'^%s\.([0-9]+)\.(.*)$' % re.escape(prefix)) ( changed [ and ] with dot ( . )) and data is parsed perfectly when using the dotted notation ( .0.foo : 'test' ).
I think it would be good to have a configurable option ( preferably in django projects settings.py file to choose of different type of html parsers )
P.S. If this somehow will effect the rest of the code i'll be glad if the community shares their opinion on this
