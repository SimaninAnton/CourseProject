Steps:
Go to almost any page in docs e.g. https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
Click on almost any link in navbar e.g. API Guide / Requests
Result: end on 404: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/api-guide/requests/
It seems to be using relative links instead of absolute ones. Also 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons,
Some links within pages seem to be broken too e.g. at the bottom of https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/ the "API guide" link is broken, but most seem OK.
Also, the 404 page looks quite wonky, seems to be missing CSS.
