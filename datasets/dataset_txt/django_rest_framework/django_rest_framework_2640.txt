When there is a trailing slash present in the URL, the format_suffix_patterns inserts the format kwarg after the trailing slash. For example:
urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(patterns(
    '',
    url(r'^test/$', dummy_view),
))

example.com/test/.json  # works but not expected
example.com/test.json/  # does not work but expected
Similar thing happens when there is an optional trailing slash via regex:
urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(patterns(
    '',
    url(r'^test/?$', dummy_view),
))

# examples
example.com/test.json    # works
example.com/test/.json   # works but not expected
example.com/test.json/   # does not work but expected
