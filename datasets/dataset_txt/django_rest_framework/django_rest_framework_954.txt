If I have a UserViewSet that subclasses the ModelViewSet, the breadcrumb for a User Instance (Detail) page is Api Root > User > User instead of the expected Api Root > User List > User Instance. I'm not sure if this is expected behavior, but I would argue against it if so. Thanks in advance for your time.
