When there is multiple inheritance (BaseEvent) -> Event <- (Period) <- (BasePeriod) , then something goes wrong and duplicated sql is created.:
INSERT INTO "cal_event" ("summary", "summary", "location", "location", "description", "description", "created", "created", "updated", "updated", "start", "start", "end", "end", "status", "busy", "transparency", "original_start", "original_end", "calendar_id", "creator_id", "recurring_id", "recurring_start", "recurring_end") VALUES (None, None, None, None, None, None, '2012-04-06 22:24:39.520000', '2012-04-06 22:24:39.520000', '2012-04-06 22:24:39.520000', '2012-04-06 22:24:39.520000', None, None, None, None, 'tentative', True, False, None, None, 1, 1, None, None, None)
the fix is to copy & paste the fields from parent models (don't do multiple inheritance)
AFAIK this only has to do with django-rest-framework, as admin & other stuff works ok with this model
