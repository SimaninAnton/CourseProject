As of #111 we now use URLObject for URL Manipulation.
There's at least two other places we ought to now be using it:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/djangorestframework/views.py#L118
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/djangorestframework/renderers.py#L315
Needs a quick look though the source to check if there's anywhere else that we should be doing the same.
May also want to use spurl (template tags around URLObject) to replace the add_query_param template tag.
