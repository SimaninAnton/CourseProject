During certain error conditions, the django-rest-framework returns a wrong response code (400).
As per RFC 2616:
The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
This means that the syntax of the request entity is malformed, and has nothing to do with the request payload (django-rest-framework deals only with request payloads, not with parsing of the byte-stream producing the request).
Is there any way to override this behavior to create standard-conforming HTTP APIs using the django-rest-framework?
