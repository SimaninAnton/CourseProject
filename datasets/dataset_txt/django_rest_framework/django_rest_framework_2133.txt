Hi,
With ModelViewSet's we can't use a custom single permission class that have the following methods?
has_permission: to give permissions when the url is /users/
has_object_permission: to give permissions when the url is /users/{pk}
Every time I make a request to /users/{pk} it runs first has_permission and this does not allow different permissions for list and detail.
