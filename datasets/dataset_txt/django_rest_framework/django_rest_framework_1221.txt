In docs/api-guide/authentication.md, section "API Reference" / "TokenAuthentication" / "Schema migrations", a migration requirement is mentioned if a custom user model is being used. However, it is explained how to do that only for South and not when using its official successor (Django migrations).
You can do so by inserting a needed_by attribute in your user migration
...
For more details, see the south documentation on dependencies.
It seems replacing needed_by with run_before is enough but I'm not sure.
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
