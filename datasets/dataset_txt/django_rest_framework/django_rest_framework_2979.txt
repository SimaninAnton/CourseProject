When None values are passed to the ModelSerializer validation, for a field that has blank=True set, but not null=True, the serializer will return "This field is required."
For example, if the field is:
title = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=False)
If no value is passed to the API view - validation will fail.
Django suggests setting non empty string fields as blank=True, null=False:
Note that empty string values will always get stored as empty strings, not as NULL. Only use null=True for non-string fields such as integers, booleans and dates...

This issue is similar to #336
Will submit a pull-request with a failing test case soon.
