The docs for MultiPartRenderer say: "It is not suitable as a response renderer, but is instead used for creating test requests".
I understand that the MultiPartRenderer is not to be used for responses but rather used for rendering requests. My question is whether it is solid enough to use in production for the server to submit data to other servers (ie make outbound requests)?
