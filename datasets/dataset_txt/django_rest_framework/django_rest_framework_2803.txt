The convention for Django model field names is to underscore them, while the convention for Javascript variables is camel-case. It would be great for DRF to automatically convert between the two.
More on this issue in this thread:

Tom suggested the following solution in that thread:
Something along the lines of a 'get_field_name' on the serializer class that can be overridden, and a setting that defines the default function and allows secs to switch to a different default style.
