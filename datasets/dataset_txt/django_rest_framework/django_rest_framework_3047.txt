I only recently understood that it is allowed to use PUT to create a resource. It might be worth mentioning in the docs that this behaviour is supported by the framework.
Secondly, it doesn't yet fully work as it should. If you put against a url that does not yet exist, an object is created for you, but on a different one. I used the rest_framework_tutorial and it just created a new object with a pk that was the latest +1, which makes sense.
I than tried using slugs as primary keys, but haven't managed to get that working.
