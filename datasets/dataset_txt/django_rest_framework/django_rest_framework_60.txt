[yes] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[yes] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[yes] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[yes] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[yes] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[no] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create serializer that has no required fields
Try to generate openapi docs for it
Expected behavior
Docs are generated
Actual behavior
KeyError: 'required'
rest_framework.schemas.openapi.AutoSchema._get_request_body has code:
        # No required fields for PATCH
        if method == 'PATCH':
            del content['required']
But key required is generated by rest_framework.schemas.openapi.AutoSchema._map_serializer:
        if len(required) > 0:
            result['required'] = required
So if there is no required fields in serializer KeyError will be raised. I think _get_request_body should handle deletion in this way:
        # No required fields for PATCH
        if method == 'PATCH and 'required' in content:
            del content['required']
