Well in some cases I want to be able to set dynamically the possible choices of a choice field. In 2.X it was enough to add something like this in the serializer init method:
self.fields['dynamic_field'].choices = new_list_of_choices
However this is no longer the case, as there are other attributes that depend on self.choices and are set upon fields initialisation e.g. choice_strings_to_values. As a quick fix I have come up with this - https://gist.github.com/IlianIliev/3941c1b031406bdf6657
I know it lacks tests etc. but I would like to hear what is the global vision with adding such a method as part of the core functionality.
