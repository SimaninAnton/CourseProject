In Django 2.1 it's possible to add Boolean fields with null=True instead of NullBooleanField
But using such field in ModelSerializer lead to an error allow_null is not a valid option. Use NullBooleanField instead.
Steps to reproduce
create some model with a field defined as models.BooleanField(null=True, blank=True), create model serializer and include model's field in the fields list
Expected behavior
No exception, serialized could be used as usual
Actual behavior
Exception is raised
