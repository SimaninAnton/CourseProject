When accessing setting though from rest_framework.settings import api_settings it will be converted from tuple to list (unless it's empty tuple). This behavior is inconsistent.
Failing test case
from rest_framework.settings import api_settings
from rest_framework.test import TestCase


class TestSettings(TestCase):
    def test_setting_type_is_not_changed(self):
        self.assertTrue(isinstace(api_settings.DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES, tuple))
Will pass with these settings:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': ()
}
But will fail with these ones:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
    )
}
Expected behavior
Setting type is not changed, when it is imported through from rest_framework.settings import api_settings.
Investigation
It seems issue comes from rest_framework/settings.py:perform_import() and can be easily fixed. I can submit pull request if it's considered a bug and not intended behavior.
