Hey there,
This may not belong here, but how do you cross reference serializers?
I have the following file with 2 serializers:
   #product discount
   class ProductClientDiscountSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
       product_full = ProductSerializer(source='product', read_only=True)

       class Meta:
           model = ProductClientDiscount
   #products
   class ProductSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
       floor_full = ProductFloorSerializer(source='floor', read_only=True)
       category_full = CategorySerializer(source='category', read_only=True)
       category_additional_full = CategorySerializer(source='category_additional',       read_only=True, many=True)
       manufacturer_full = ManufacturerSerializer(source='manufacturer',    read_only=True)
       product_brochure_full = ProductBrochureSerializer(source='productBrochure', read_only=True)
       discounts = ProductClientDiscountSerializer(source='productclientdiscount_set', read_only=True)

       class Meta:
           model = Product
For some reason it's complaining that "ProductSerializer" does not exist. Which I assume is because it's below it in the same file. How do I reference a serializer below another?
