Guys, I'm sorry I'm writing here. But only here I can get an answer. Since I already wrote https://gitter.im/tomchristie/django-rest-framework , https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/django-rest-framework/9bc7IKn9oYI, #5152 . But I did not receive a response.
I used to The autoogrnerated API docs(From the core of Django Rest framework).
For generation I use generics, viewsets, mixins.
Simple example:
users/ - Displayed in documentation
users/{id} - Displayed in documentation
users/personal-profile - Not displayed in documentation
class UserPersonalProfile(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):
permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)
serializer_class = UserSerializer
queryset = User.objects.all()
def get_object(self):
    return self.request.user
For the account does not work at all since there endpoints like:
/accounts/base-sign-up
/accounts/base-auth-token
/accounts/sn-auth-token
