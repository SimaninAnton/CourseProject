Steps to reproduce
I have 2 apps in a django project. one is auth, another is live
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^auth/', include('qxauth.urls')),
    url(r'^live/', include('qxlive.urls')),
    url(r'^docs/', include_docs_urls('API Documentation')),
]
but when I open the
locahost:8000/docs
it will only show the apps name,
no content will be show.
unless I commented out another apps url
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^auth/', include('qxauth.urls')),
    # url(r'^live/', include('qxlive.urls')),
    url(r'^docs/', include_docs_urls('API Documentation')),
]
then I can see the doc
Expected behavior
I should see the doc of auth app and live app
Actual behavior
the doc genarated is blank, and no errors in the console..
