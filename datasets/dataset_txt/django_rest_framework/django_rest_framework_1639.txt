I'm going crazy trying to figure out how to get the browsable API to show a @list_route custom method on a ModelViewSet. It looks like it should automatically show up in the browsable API but it doesn't. Is this a bug? This unanswered stack overflow question exactly details the issue I'm trying to sort out.
