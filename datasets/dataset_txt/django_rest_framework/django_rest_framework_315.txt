I naively was reading the v2 docs http://www.tomchristie.com/rest-framework-2-docs/ because on the main site it said "Note: This is the documentation for the version 3 of REST framework. Documentation for version 2 is also available.".
As django 2.x is fairly new, I misread and assumed drf was lagging with a matching version. In reality the current releases of drf are 3.8.x. Consider removing this mention at the top of the homepage. Or maybe add a version navigator in the lower right corner, same as the django docs.
