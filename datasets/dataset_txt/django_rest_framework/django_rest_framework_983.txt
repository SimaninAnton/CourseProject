Hi,
I simply want to be able to query objects in my viewset by a field containing a full URL including dots and forward slashes. For this I started to override the get_object method of the viewset but I got stuck because this means that I have to be able to go to resource http://www.server.com/myresource/http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom/ which yields a 404 even when urlencoding the URL because the default generated regex for pk fields is (?P<pk>[^/.]+). I only need to be able to do this for a single endpoint in my urlconf, which is the detail URL of a viewset. All other endpoints of the viewset are OK and should remain standard. Is there a way to change the regex for only this endpoint?
