A RepresenterError occurs when trying to render a DecimalField with YAMLRenderer
RepresenterError: cannot represent an object: 55.378051
Adding
SafeDumper.add_representer(decimal.Decimal, SafeDumper.represent_decimal)
just after the declaration of SafeDumper (utils/encoders.py) seems to fix the problem.
