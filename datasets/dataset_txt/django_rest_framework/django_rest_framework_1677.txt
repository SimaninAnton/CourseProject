See #2804 and #2674.
An M2M model field with blank=True leads to a generic serializer field with required=True. This means DRF does not consider it valid to omit the field in the dataset but sending an empty array/list is valid since #2804 was fixed. It should be required=False to adapt the Django behavior.
