I have two apps whose urls.py looks like:
router = DefaultRouter()
router.register('XXX', App1.views.XXXViewSet, base_name='XXX')
urls = [
    url(r'^api/', include(router.urls)),
]
urlpatterns = patterns('', *urls)
and the difference for the second app:
router.register('YYY', App2.views.YYYViewSet, base_name='YYY')
however the API root view found at api/: only shows a link for the first app (which ever is listed first in the projects urls.py file).
Both of the endpoints DO work:
api/XXX and api/YYY
