I tried to use InstanceModelView for a standard Django Model for CRUD operations. But, a simple POST request doesn't finish on such view and apache2 thread goes out of memory. Upon investigating a bit, it seems that validate_request in FormResource is causing it.
I later made a Resource from BaseResource (instead of ModelResource) class and that worked fine for POST.
