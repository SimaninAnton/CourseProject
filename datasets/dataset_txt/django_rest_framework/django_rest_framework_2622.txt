There doesn't seem to be a way to have different permissions for list and detail views in a ViewSet. My use case is that I have a users api that exposes email addresses, I only want admins to be able to list all users, users should only be able to access their own user.
Perhaps there could be class variables such as permission_classes_list and permisssion_classes_detail or something like that.
