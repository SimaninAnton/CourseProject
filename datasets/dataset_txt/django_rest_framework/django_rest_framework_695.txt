For historic reasons I have a nested schema, below is a pseudo coreapi dump of the api. With the old rest swagger and the yaml descriptions it was possible to describe this, but with the new built in docs view, they nested calls/links to not appear, since the nested "data" elements are ignored.
    : {
        list()
    }
    api-token-auth: {
        create(username, password)
    }
    archive: {
        list_archive(start_datetime)
        read(entry_id)
    }
    elements: {
        available-stationary-objects: {
            list()
            read(my_id)
        }
        available-movable-objects: {
            list()
            read(my_id)
        }
        available-xyz: {
            list()
            read(my_id)
        }
    }
    returned-items: {
        letters: {
            list()
        }
    }
    
    some_namespace: {
        prepare()
        read(my_id)
        cancel(my_id)
        finish(my_id)
    }
The available-...-object elements do not appear in the docs view.
