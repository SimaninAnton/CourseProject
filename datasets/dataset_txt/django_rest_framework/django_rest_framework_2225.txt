Hello,
Previously, in DRF 2.x ValidationError were caught and turned into HTTP 400 errors.
However this doesn't seem to be happening any more in version 3.x. ValidationErrors are not caught and become HTTP 500 errors. This seems wrong.
I am not sure where ValidationError are meant to be caught. However I note that the create() method in CreateModelMixen calls is_valid() with raise_exception=True, and UpdateModelMixin has a similar update() method; yet neither method tries to catch the exception.
Also wondering where it is ok to raise ValidationError. Am am assuming that serializer.run_validators and serializer.validate() can raise ValidationError, but not so sure about seralizer.create() and seralizer.update() - it could be argued that any ValidationError need to be raised before this point.
Thanks
