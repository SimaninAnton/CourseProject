According Wikipedia:
The general format of the field is:
X-Forwarded-For: client, proxy1, proxy2
But the DRF Doc on Throttling:
If set to non-zero then the client IP will be identified as being the last IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header, once any application proxy IP addresses have first been excluded.
If my goal is to get the Client IP, shouldn't this always be the first IP address in the header?
Right now if my X-Forwarded-For header contains "client, proxy1, proxy2" and I set NUM_PROXIES to 2, get_ident() returns "proxy1".
I'm not sure if I'm missing something here or if this is a bug?
