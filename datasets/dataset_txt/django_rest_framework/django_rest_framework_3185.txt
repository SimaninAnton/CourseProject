There's very little reason left why you shouldn't be able to auto-generate an API for all the installed models in an application, with a one-liner autodiscover. Ideally, if there's a resource defined for a model it ought to use that resource for the model (note that there's currently a commented out _RegisterModelResource in resources.py that can do the registration.)
Ideally this requires #13.
