I'm running into the issue that you are not able to change the Django Admin behavior for the Token model without being a bit hacky. I'm wondering about removing rest_framework/authtoken/admin.py file and letting the developer to enable it in Django Admin if required.
Just for the record, I tried opening the edit form for a Token object, and it is really slow due the large amount of users we have on production, adding the user field to raw_id_fields solves the problem. That took me to open this issue and making it more flexible and easy to integrate.
Thanks @tomchristie for the hard work! IMO this is the best REST Library for Django at this time.
