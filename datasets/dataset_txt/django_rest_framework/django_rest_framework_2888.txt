To make it clear - this is not an issue per se.
I'm just intrigued by the writings on https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/docs/api-guide/content-negotiation.md :
Note: "q" values are not taken into account by REST framework when determining preference. The use of "q" values negatively impacts caching, and in the author's opinion they are an unnecessary and overcomplicated approach to content negotiation.
That's a rather defensive move imho since the client can negatively influence the use of caching by playing with the conditional headers or any of the headers in Vary in numerous ways (change order, add, remove).
Don't know what's so overcomplicated, but I'd like to know. I'm not trying to change anybody's mind here, nor am I saying this is wrong. Thanks for sharing.
