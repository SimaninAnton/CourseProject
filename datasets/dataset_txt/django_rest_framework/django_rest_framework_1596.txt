Since Django 1.8 you can't use ModelForms without the fields or exclude fields attribute:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/forms/modelforms/#selecting-the-fields-to-use
I think ModelSerializers should behave the same way because this will make DjangoRestFramework more secure for programming "mistakes", e.g. adding an admin changeable field on a model, later realizing that the field is now editable for the public because you didn't explicitly provided the fields.
This would be a backwards-incompatible update though.
Here's the commit in Django:

What do you think?
