When building an API for an existing system, there will naturally be tons of forms with all kinds of validation logic. Forms may be calling Models in order to make sure values are valid (e.g. ModelChoiceField), or containing complex logic flows that validate and clean data.
How can I reuse all that logic in an APIView, in a DRY way?
I have turned the documentation inside out and can not find any mention of this. Have also Googled a lot for this, and the only thing I can find is basically "break out everything into helper functions and manually attach hooks where relevant". That's not very helpful or "frameworky".
Am I missing something obvious here? Or is everyone else literally replicating all validation logic between Forms And Serializers?
In Tastypie, Form classes are a natural part of the framework via the FormValidation class. Is this not possible in django-rest-framework? If so, is that a conscious design decision? And if so, what's the thought behind it? Are there any third party additions that make this possible?
Sorry if this is nooby, thanks for your consideration.
