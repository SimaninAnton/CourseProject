Hi!
I want to use serializer like
class FooSerializer(HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Foo
Then, on serializing result I have all fields of my Foo model, but without pk and with url.
What I want to achieve is to get both pk and url fields.
I know I could set Meta.fields and there put all my fields explicitly, but then I should do it in all my serializers.
Therefore I want to override get_default_field_names, I do it inside my FooSerializer, but if wont run my method at all :(
Could you help with it please?
