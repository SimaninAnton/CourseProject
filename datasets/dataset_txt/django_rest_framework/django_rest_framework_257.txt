The third party packages section has a link to drf_openapi:
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/schemas/#drf-openapi
But drf_openapi has been deprecated and seems to be a dead project now:
https://github.com/limdauto/drf_openapi
Should the docs be updated to either to indicate that this package is deprecated, or maybe just remove the reference all together? Would you accept a PR?
