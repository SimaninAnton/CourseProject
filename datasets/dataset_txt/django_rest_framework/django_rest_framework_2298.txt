I need to represent a relation by different attribute than primary key. It's also unique and I would like to use it in post method, also using DRF default forms.
Currently users don't have access to our primary key, so how they are supposed to provide in POST requests?
I would like to have a support for lookup_field to configure which field I want to use for getting the foreign key object.
