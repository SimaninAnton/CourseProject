I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
class DummyView(APIView):
    renderer_classes = (AdminRenderer, )
    def get(self, request):
        return Response({'items' : 'a string'})
Expected behavior
To see the table.
Actual behavior
It debug=True an exception is raised.
It debug=False the DRF admin template is rendered with the header and forms, but the main content is empty.
