I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
Pypi 3.5.3
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
a. Have attached project to highlight issue [Uses Python 3.5]
/api/SampleRouteLimited/ will show single method available
/schema/ shows all methods normal for a viewset
b. Alternatively use an existing viewset.
Limit viewset to a single method
i.e., http_method_names = ['get']
generate schema
Expected behavior
Only show schema information for requested methods.
Actual behavior
Returns information for all methods, even if not allowed.
