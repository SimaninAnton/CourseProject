I'm using Django REST framework 3.3.1 and Django 1.8.7.
In my template, I have something like:
{% for message in messages %}
{{ message }}
{% endfor %}
In my view, I do the following:
return Response({'form': form, 'messages': messages}, template_name='a.html')
Form gets displayed OK, but messages doesn't get displayed.
If I change my view to "return Response({'form': form, 'msgs': messages}, template_name='a.html')" and my template to "{% for message in msgs %}", both will get displayed fine.
However if I do "return render(request, 'a.html', {'form': form, 'messages': messages})", both will get displayed fine too. So it seems to me that 'messages' is not a keyword I should avoid using.
Though I have a workaround by changing 'messages' to 'msgs', I'd appreciate if someone looks into this.
Thanks!
