In my ModelSerializer I've got:
function1 = serializer.ManyRelatedField()
In my models I've got:
def function1(self): return self.relation1.relation2
relation2 would return a queryset. Altought, executing this raises at "return [self.to_native(item) for item in value.all()]" in relations.py:
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'all'
This is because it is not a field but a function and it is not being invoked. I believe that support for this scenario would increase the use cases supported by the framework. It would be done by verifying if "value" is a value, keeping the current behaviour, or a function, invoking it before calling all(), with value().all().
