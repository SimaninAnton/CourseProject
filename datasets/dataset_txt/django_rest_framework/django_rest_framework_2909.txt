Is there a reason why this doesn't work?

from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url
from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns
from . import views  

v1_api = patterns('', 
    url(r'^users/$', views.UserList.as_view()), 
    url(r'^users/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/$', views.UserDetail.as_view()),      
    url(r'^quotes/$', views.QuoteList.as_view()),          
    url(r'^quotes/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/$', views.QuoteDetail.as_view()),
)                                                                                          

urlpatterns = patterns('',                                                       
    url(r'^auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),
    url(r'^v1/', include(format_suffix_patterns(v1_api))),                              
)
This is an app specific urlconf that is included from the main application at ^/api.
I can view the browseable API at /api/v1/users/, but /api/v1/users.html or /api/v1/users.json returns a 404.
