SortedDict is pending deprecation as of Django 1.7 - https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SortedDict
We need to replace it's usage with something else, in a way that is compatible across all supported version. This may mean using collections.OrderedDict and dropping python 2.6 support, but other options could be considered.
