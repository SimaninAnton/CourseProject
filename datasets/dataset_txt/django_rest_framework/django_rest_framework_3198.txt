Make sure all the modules in the top level 'django-rest-framework' are in the 'library reference', and they're all auto-documenting from the source properly.
Make sure the auto-documenting stuff in there is doing stuff correctly, eg like linking to classes, attributes etc. Ensuring that only public methods are being documented.
