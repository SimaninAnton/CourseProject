What happens: The BrowsableAPI throws "'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'successful_authenticator'"
What I expect: The BrowsableAPI shows the list view without a post form.
The BrowsableAPI doesn't render for an authenticated user with no permissions on a viewset with: DangoModelPermissions.
The permissions of a user are checked twice, once with a request.method = GET and once with a request.method = POST. During the request.method = POST the permissions need to {app}.{add_object}, which the user doesn't have.
