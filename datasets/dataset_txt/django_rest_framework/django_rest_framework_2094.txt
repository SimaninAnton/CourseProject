Currently it's way too easy for our users to accidental use an unsupported version of Django.
Eg. 1.6 instead of 1.6.3+, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27497676/django-rest-api-urlsplit-error
We should probably add a range of minimum requirements to the install_requires key in setup.py. We may choose not to cap the maximum version? Be nice if we can ensure there's no conflict with eg installing against a PYTHONPATH forked version of Django - we don't want to stomp on users if they're confident in a different setup.
