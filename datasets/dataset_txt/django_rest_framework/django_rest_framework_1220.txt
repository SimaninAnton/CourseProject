Steps to reproduce
My code just like this.
MY_CHOICES = (
    (0, 'happy'),
    (1, 'sad')
)
serializers.ChoiceField(MY_CHOICES)
Expected behavior
When the value of the field is 0, I expect the representation is 'happy'.
Actual behavior
It's representation 0 instead.
When I change the code of ChoiceField, it well be right. The diff of the change is https://github.com/jz0630/django-rest-framework/commit/958033ad878f3eb0d0dcbe45dd35c7a4bda53654
