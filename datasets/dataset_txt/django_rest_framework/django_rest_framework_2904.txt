I'm using nested ModelSerializers and for some of them I don't want all the defined fields to appear, only a subset.
Right now I'm having to subclass the ModelSerializers and define a new fields set. But it would be much nicer if we could do something like
class ProductSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'description', 'price', 'status')

class OrderSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    product = ProductSerializer(only=('id', 'name', 'price'))
    class Meta:
        model = Order
        fields = ('id', 'sku', 'product', 'date')
I looked around and probably patching the BaseSerializer.get_fields method would do the trick.
Is there a need for this? Any concerns about doing it?
