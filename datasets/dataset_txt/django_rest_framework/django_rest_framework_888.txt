Overview
The file rest_framework/static/rest_framework/docs/css/bootstrap.min.css references ../fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot. However, the file actually exists at ../../fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot. This is throwing an error when trying to run collectstatic:
Post-processing 'rest_framework/docs/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css' failed!

Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
