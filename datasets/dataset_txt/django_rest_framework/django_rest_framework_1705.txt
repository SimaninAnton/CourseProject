When I use Python3 an have nested model serializers I see this error:
'BoundField' object is not iterable
I made a little investigation and found that BoundField proxy does not work for some reason.
I run in Python console (both Python2 and Python3) this example code:
 class I():
     def __iter__(self):
         for i in range(5):
             yield i

class BoundI():
    def __init__(self, i):
        self._i = i
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return getattr(self._i, attr)

i = I()
bi = BoundI(i)

list(i)  # work
list(bi)  # work only on Python2. In Py3 the error is "object is not iterable"
These example classes use the same logic as Serialzier and BoundField classes in DRF.
