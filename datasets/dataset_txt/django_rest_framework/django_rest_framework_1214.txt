I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
when I try to include rest_framework.urls or router.urls on urls.py then see that deploy success but when enter to webpage I get error 503
mycode
from app import views
router = routers.SimpleRouter()
router.register(r'users', views.UserViewSet)
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^api', include(router.urls)),
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
]
I can run normal with local host or deploy to openshift without include urls
I using:
djangorestframework>=3.3.3
Markdown>=2.6.6
django-filter>=0.13.0
django>=1.9.5
django-oauth-toolkit>=0.10.0
djangorestframework-oauth>=1.1.0
django-crispy-forms>=1.6.0
djangorestframework-gis>=0.10.1
