Django 1.8 supports the Array data type from postgres.
A simple solution is to use a ListField Serializer:
    field_names = serializers.ListField(child=serializers.CharField(max_length=32, allow_blank=True))
as seen in this issue: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-rest-framework/Rolw5yEQ8cU
It would help if this was part of the documentation.
