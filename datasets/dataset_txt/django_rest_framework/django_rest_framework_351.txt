The documentation on the website seems to be out of date.
For instance, here you can see this code snippet:
urlpatterns += [
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls')),
]
which is wrong, it should be path(), not url(). However, it seems like in the master branch this issue is fixed. So I guess we need to push the docs changes to the website.
