Currently I'm using the framework whereby as a browser the data gets rendered using the TemplateHTMLRenderer and when the client requests JSON the renderer returns the data using JSONRenderer.
To do this on the relevant views I set renderer_classes to:
(renderers.TemplateHTMLRenderer, renderers.JSONRender)
This works OK when using generics.RetrieveAPIView but in my template I only have access to the results variable rather than all the stuff that JSONRenderer returns. However with a generics.ListAPIView that data is not available at all.
Am I going about this the right way? If yes then how should I get access to list data?
