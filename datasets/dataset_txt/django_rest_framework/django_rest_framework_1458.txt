Hi there!
I have added an HTTP method to a view set, with the SimpleRouter and the list_route decorator.
I am having an issue with the permission classes for this method alone. I set a permission (different from the ViewSet) in the decorator as in the current docs:
#/jobs/
class JobViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = JobSerializer
    permission_classes = (AuthenticatedOwnerPermission, )
...
    #/jobs/active
    @list_route(methods=['get'], permission_classes=[AuthenticatedUserPermission])
    def active(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        active = Job.active_job(self.request.user)
        data = self.get_serializer(active).data if active else None
        return Response(data)
But this different permission class is ignored. Maybe this is on purpose?
Or should it be working as it is, and the problem is elsewhere?
Thanks!
