Besides traditional ListCreateAPIView, I also have function based views using @api_view decorator. Unfortunately, these are not picked up in the generated documentation. They are, however, present in the schema.
Steps to reproduce
Write function view, open docs.
Expected behavior
Function views should be present in the generated documentation. DRF docs or Swagger for DRF can pick them as as expected.
Actual behavior
Views are not present.
Or am I missing something? Thanks
