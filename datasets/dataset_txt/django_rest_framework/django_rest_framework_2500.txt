When URLs with an escaped character (specifically in my case, and ampersand) is rendered in the browsable API, in the href it is improperly unescaped. This may only apply to ampersands.
For example, this URL:
http://localhost:8000/endpoint/?param1=Yes+%26+No&param2=something
Would be rendered as:
http://localhost:8000/endpoint/?param1=Yes+&+No&param2=something
The URL is rendered in the value of the a element correctly... this only applies to the href.
