On heroku, all client IP are set in HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header as REMOTE_ADDR return heroku proxy IP address.
This affects anonymous user throttle.
Currently I'm using this in my codes:
request.META.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR'))
Maybe a setting to choose the header is better?
