I dislike that the output of my API changes when I enable pagination. HTTP provides Range and Accept-Ranges headers for this, as documented on https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.org/en/latest/methods.html#ranges-pagination. I'm willing to provide some patches to change this behaviour, but that would mean an API change for users. Before I start I would like some opinion about this.
