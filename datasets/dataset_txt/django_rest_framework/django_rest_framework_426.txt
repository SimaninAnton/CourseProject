I have a model that has an relation, and i only want a single field from the related table.
def to_representation(self, instance):
        return instance.type
The serializer returns the type column value (a string), and all is fine. But the API browser crashed with the error:
Exception Value: | 'str' object has no attribute 'items'
rest_framework/templates/rest_framework/horizontal/form.html, error at line 4
 {% load rest_framework %}
{% for field in form %}
{% if not field.read_only %}
{% render_field field style=style %} <--- Here
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
If i turn the format to json it works as expected.
