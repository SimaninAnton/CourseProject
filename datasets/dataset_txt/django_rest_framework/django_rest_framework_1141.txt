Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
When looking through the documentation for API versioning, I came across the docs for ALLOWED_VERSIONS.
Expected behavior
When reading through the documentation, I expected the type that the value should be set to to be defined. For example "This setting's value should be a list or tuple of string values".
Actual behavior
The expected data type is not explicitly defined in the documentation. I had to look up the code that checks the value to determine what the expected value is.
