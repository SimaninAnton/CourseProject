The docs have a great explanation for how to create nested relationships between serializers, but no explanation (that I can find) for how to use them.
As per the example above, lets say I have two querysets, one called 'album', and one called 'tracks'. How do I serialize these querysets into a single python object?
I get that if they weren't nested you could just do:
AlbumSerializer(album).data
TrackSerializer(tracks, many=True).data
But how do you do this when they're nested and get back a single python object?
