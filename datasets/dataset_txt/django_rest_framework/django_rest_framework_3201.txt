At the moment none of the tests are able to create some mock Models and test stuff against them, because the tests don't have a models.py. It be good if we could just do something like add 'models.py' into the tests directory, and add 'djangorestframework.tests' as an INSTALLED_APP in the runtests.py script, or something like that. But needs someone to find out if that'd actually work, how to add them in the runtests.py script, and make sure they're not installed if you just do a regular syncdb on djangorestframework.
For example, would be nice to see some tests to check serializing of nested models, but we wouldn't want those models to actually be installed in djangorestframework by default.
