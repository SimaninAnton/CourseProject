BooleanField according to its description should only work with True or False values. But in some cases, it can return None as a serialized value, thus returning data, which itself wouldn't validate.
Steps to reproduce
from rest_framework import serializers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    password = serializers.BooleanField()
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('password',)

UserSerializer(User(password=None)).data
#>>> ReturnDict([('password', None)])
Expected behavior
BooleanField should serialize values into either True or False. None should be serialized into False.
Actual behavior
BooleanField serializes None into None.
