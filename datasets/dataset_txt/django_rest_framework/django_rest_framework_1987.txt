Debugging the 3.0 upgrade was sometimes difficult because some the errors I had been receiving were misleading and/or uninformative. This one in particular told me that "'RelatedManager' has no attribute " when in fact the real error is that many=True is not specified in the child serializer (which was not required prior to 3.0).
See example below:
class Stats(models.Model):
  my_model = models.OneToOneField(MyModel, primary_key=True, related_name='stats')

class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

  class Meta(object):
    fields = ('stats',)

class MyModelSerializerFull(MyModelSerializer):
  children = MyModelSerializer()  # should be many=True

  class Meta(MySerializer.Meta):
    fields = MyModelSerializer.Meta.fields + ('children',)
When attempting to access MyModelSerializerFull(params).data, I get the following error message:
AttributeError: 'RelatedManager' object has no attribute 'stats'
It would be nice if instead this said something more useful that would help identify the actual problem.
