Hi!
I'm looking for an easy way to use the Django backend to have an overview of existing Tokens. Using admin.site.register(rest_framework.authtoken.models.Token) to add the Token-model to the Django admin gives me a nice and simple overview of all existing tokens.
However, I can't add new tokens, because the key-field does not validate becasue it can't be empty.
Since the Token-model generates the key if it is empty, adding 'blank=True' to the key-property would make it possible to create a Token in the backend.
Are there reasons not to do this?
Thanks!
Gertjan
