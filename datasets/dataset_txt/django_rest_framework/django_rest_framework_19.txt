I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
when i use patch method, some fields are not present in validated_data while validation of other fields depend on them.
For example, i need to make sure that tag associated with a post are the same owner. While patching, there is a exception and i notice that there isn't owner data.
How i process this case? Can i get the data when validating data. Or i must use put method.
