I love the newest iteration of django-rest-framework. It's clean and beautiful. It kinda reminds me of django-admin. In fact, both apps share a lot of features and DRF looks like a superset of django-admin. I'm sure both apps can be nicely integrated. DRF can make a clean API which (new) Admin could then consume. Just thinking out loudly.
What do you think?
