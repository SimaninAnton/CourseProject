Remove APIView.get_name and APIView.get_description, and instead use settings-configurable functions.
REST_FRAMEWORK setting should get two new keys - VIEW_NAME_FUNCTION and VIEW_DESCRIPTION_FUNCTION, that should point to functions that take a single argument (the view) and return the name/description to use for that view.
The default implementations should have the same behavior as the current methods provide.
This would mean that...
Easier to configure different name/description styles, eg use .rst descriptions.
Update setting once, will apply to all CBVs and decorators.
Less logic on APIView, which is a good thing.
