Hi,
I have that kind of serializer
class InvoiceListSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  payer  = ContactListSerializer(read_only=True)

  class Meta:
    model  = X
    fields = (
      'id','number', 'payer'
    )
If I want to show a list of 20 invoices, there is 1 SQL request for "id,number" of those 20 invoices AND there are 20 SQL requests for "payer" (one per invoice)
It doesn't seems to be really optimized. Did I miss something? Is it possible to use "join" with DRF ?
Thanks for your help
