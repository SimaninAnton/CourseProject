I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add the now-mandatory app_name configuration to an app (in Django 2.0) using DRF or otherwise pass an app_name using the 2-tuple form of url include(...). HyperlinkedModelSerializer will raise the following exception whilst rendering a view containing auto-generated url fields:
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "XXX-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the lookup_field attribute on this field.
Expected behavior
The page should render with functional URLs
Actual behavior
Exception is raised.
Can be worked around by manually defining the url field on each Serializer and specifying a view_name kawarg which duplicates the app_name:view_name values. Each field referring to another object must be similarly defined manually.
Raised following discussion on issue #5659 . PR to follow.
