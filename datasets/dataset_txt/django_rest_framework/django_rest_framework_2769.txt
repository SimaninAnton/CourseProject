I have a bunch of ModelViewSets and a renderer stack consisting of TemplateHTMLRenderer on top of JSONRenderer. I reasonably expect to be able to specify different templates for the different views of a ViewSet, however, currently I can only add a get_template_names method to a ViewSet, but it returns the same value for any view.
I'm also surprised that there doesn't even seem to be a default implementation of get_template_names in APIViews and ViewSets that returns the value of a template_names attribute, as is commonplace in Django.
How would we best approach mapping template names to individual views of a ViewSet?
