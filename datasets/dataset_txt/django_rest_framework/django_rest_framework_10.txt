Requests to an authenticated api on a not allowed method by not authenticated user returns 403 instead of a 405 status code.
As seen here:
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/views.py
Line 493 in 373e521
 self.initial(request, *args, **kwargs) 
My question is, is this the correct behavior of an api?
I would expect to get a 405 status code, no authentication needed.
Frankly, I would expect a 401, not authorized instead of a 403
As described in http decision diagram repository.

Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Just a basic request to an api without a handler for a method and with authentication
Expected behavior
Getting a 405 status code instead of 403
Actual behavior
I'm getting a 403 instead of a 405
