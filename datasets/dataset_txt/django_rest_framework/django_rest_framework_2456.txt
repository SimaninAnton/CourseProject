I am using DRF to provide both API (mostly paginated resources) but also export large data files (not paginated resources).
I am confronted to performance issues. I made many optimizations (prefetch_related, and others) and found many articles dealing with large database perfs using a queryset iterator (Model.objects.all().iterator()).
It seems that DRF don't use it, has no options for using it, and can't accept this iterator as a queryset (as it is a generator, and does not contain the same information as the queryset Object).
Is it planned, or considered to improve performance of large DB serialization ?
