Hi there,
My usecase is: I'd like to provide the endpoint json to our angularjs service rendered as part of a standard view response. - to save the overhead of another request and also to spare us having "please wait loading.." messages all over the show.
I have hacked a nasty method that uses the APIClient (ouch) and it works (but modifies the response object.
Is there a cleaner means of accomplishing this?
thanks in advance
