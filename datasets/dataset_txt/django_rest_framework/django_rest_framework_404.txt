Why django / Django-rest-framework don't provide a way to automatically save and refresh caching api responses. I am working to define a logic that it can easily be automatised by the framework :
Save cache when apiview recieves a GET.
Delete related cache when apiview recives POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.
Consider related models in the step 2.
Are theire any plans to implement this in DRF in the future ?
