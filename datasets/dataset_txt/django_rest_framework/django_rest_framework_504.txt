def ListSerializer.to_representation:
        iterable = data.all() if isinstance(data, models.Manager) else data
        return [self.child.to_representation(item) for item in iterable]
A manager can have .all() method, but not be iterable. E.g. models.Manager is defined as:
class Manager(manager.BaseManager.from_queryset(query.QuerySet)):
    pass
and is not iterable. Creating and using another manager:
class Manager2(manager.BaseManager.from_queryset(newQuerySet)):
    pass
does not work with ListSerializer.to_representation() because it is not derived from models.Manager and is not iterable.
I propose changing the implementation to
iterable = data.all() if hasattr(data, 'all') else data
