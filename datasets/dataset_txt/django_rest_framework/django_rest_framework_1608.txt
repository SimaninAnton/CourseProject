rest_framework.utils.html.is_html_input() combined with rest_framework.utils.html.parse_html_dict() does not detect 3+ level dictionaries, for example.
Multipart representation of {'a':{'b':{'c':123}}} is QueryDict([('a.b.c',123)]), so is_html_input() properly detects nested dictionary.
On the second pass there is {'b.c':123} and is_html_input() does not detect the nested dictionary.
My suggestion is to either instantiate or return MultiValueDict instead of simple dict in parse_html_dict() (and possibly parse_html_list())
