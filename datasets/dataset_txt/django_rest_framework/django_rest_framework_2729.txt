The documentation says that this is a "shortcut" for setting either or both of the serializer_class and queryset attributes. I'm not using this shortcut, I'm using get_serializer_class() and get_queryset() methods.
The problem is that one of model or queryset is apparently required if you want to use DjangoModelPermissions.
I don't want to use the model shortcut (which is somewhat overloaded now, performing three functions - two of which I don't need), and I don't want to use queryset because that should be redundant when I am using get_queryset().
Can DjangoModelPermissions not get the model from the queryset returned by get_queryset() in this case?
