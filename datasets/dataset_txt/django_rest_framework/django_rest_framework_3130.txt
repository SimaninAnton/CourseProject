Currently relies on django-admin being installed, which isn't ideal, because:
It'll break if the django admin static files aren't available.
It may break if you customize the admin style (eg grappelli.)
Makes setup marginally more complicated.
Makes it difficult to override styles for just the API.
Should instead use staticfiles, and have all required files in '/static'. If you're using Django 1.2 you'll need staticfiles as a dependency.
Required to fix #48.
