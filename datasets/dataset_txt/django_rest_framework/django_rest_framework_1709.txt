RelatedField.choices() raises a TypeError("'*' object is not iterable",) when queryset is a manager.
When calling choices() from the template this was being silenced by django.
Using a manager as the queryset for RelatedField happens in quite a few cases, such as in get_relation_kwargs which is used by ModelSerializer.
