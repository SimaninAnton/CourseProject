Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a Django 2.0 URLconf and generate a schema from it.
urlpatterns = [
  path('example/', ExampleListView.as_view()),
  path('example/<int:pk>/', ExampleDetailView.as_view()),
]
Expected behavior
Get a schema with urls /example/ and /example/{id}/
Actual behavior
Got /example\\/ and /example\\/{id}\\/.
Ref: marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger#718
Background
Django 2.0 auto-escapes the string passed into path(), see this piece of code
Possible solution
SchemaGenerator could undo this escaping when building the schema, I'm working on PR that does this.
