Hi, I just finished the Quickstart & Tutorial of this framework. I would like to point out that I think the following phrase in Tutorial part 7 is incorrect:
If you visit the API root endpoint in a browser you should now see corejson representation become available as an option.
With the code you built up just before, corejson is not available on the root endpoint, but on the /schema endpoint.
I also find it unclear that in the Quickstart, the recommendation is to have an app in a subfolder of a Django root app - to avoid name conflicts, as you state - while in the Tutorial you start off with the app folder just being a subfolder of the Django project folder, as though the recommendation wasn't that important at all. I'm still confused, but suppose it then doesn't matter that much how we structure our folders. See also my Stack Overflow question about this for more info if this explanation was not very clear.
Could you fix these issues in the Quickstart & Tutorial? People will have a better learning experience if you do, in my opinion.
Thanks! Kind regards.
