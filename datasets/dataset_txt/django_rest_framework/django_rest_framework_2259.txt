I've found myself digging through the source code of rest_framework a lot to really get a grasp on how DRF processes a requests; sometimes I'm unsure of who calls what.
Tasty pie has an excellent writeup on the its general flow from request to response flow for a simple GET request:
The Resource.urls are checked by Djangoâ€™s url resolvers.
On a match for the list view, Resource.wrap_view('dispatch_list') is called. wrap_view provides basic error handling & allows for returning serialized errors.
Because dispatch_list was passed to wrap_view, Resource.dispatch_list is called next. This is a thin wrapper around Resource.dispatch.
dispatch does a bunch of heavy lifting. It ensures:
the requested HTTP method is in allowed_methods (method_check),
DRF has excellent documentation for many of its individual components; it would be tremendously helpful if DRF had a page that outlined, generally, how the package works. What is the general flow of the innards--how does DRF process a typical request --> response?
Thanks @tomchristie for such an excellent package!
