If you create a base view and document an API there (in the docstring), a subclass can often re-use that very same docstring. If there are real changes, you should of course write a new docstring.
Currently those docstrings of a parent class aren't inherited in Python.
A bit of extra could could be added in .get_description() like this:
    description = self.__doc__
    if description is None:
        try:
            description = next(
                cls.__doc__ for cls in inspect.getmro(type(self))
                if cls.__doc__ is not None)
        except StopIteration:
            pass
