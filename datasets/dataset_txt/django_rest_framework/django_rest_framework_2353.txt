Hello,
I've got a problem POSTing to User api after upgrading DRF from 2.3.13 to 2.3.14.
When trying to add new User, process stops with an error "ValueError: "<User: Foo>" needs to have a value for field "user" before this many-to-many relationship can be used". I tried to trace down this problem, and it seems that error is raised when calling serializer.is_valid() in create method from CreateModelMixin. Any ideas what change could be causing this?
Thanks in advance
