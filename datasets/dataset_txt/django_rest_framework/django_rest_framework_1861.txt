I'm trying to post data from a default ModelForm to a DRF-powered API endpoint which uses a default ModelSerializer for the same model.
The NullBooleanField isn't being deserialized correctly. By default, the ModelForm renders the field as a select widget with 3 options (1=Null, 2=True, 3=False), and I think it has something to do with the difference between how Django handles the incoming data and copes with the 3 different values and how DRF's TRUE_VALUES, FALSE_VALUES and NULL_VALUES are not taking into account what ModelForm typically renders.
Is this by design, and does this mean I'd better change how ModelForm renders the field?
