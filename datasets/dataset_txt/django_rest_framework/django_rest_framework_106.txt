I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
djangorestframework==3.10.0
# serializers.py
class MySerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    my_values = serializers.ListField(child=serializers.FloatField())

# views.py
class MyAPIView(GenericAPIView):
    serializer_class = MySerializer
urls.py and templates/swagger-ui.html are same as described in documentation.
Expected behavior
Swagger should render schema without any problems.
Actual behavior
swagger

console
I think the latest version of drf does not handle ListField correctly. The array type in OpenAPI should come with corresponding items, but AutoSchema in rest_framework.schemas.openapi does not provide items for ListField in _map_field method.
