I have a ViewSet with search_fields.
When I do a get request with a non ASCII code it give me UnicodeDecodeError.
Example:
/api/users/?search=cer√®
I got this error:
UnicodeDecodeError at /api/users/
'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)
Is there something I'm missing or a bug?
