Hello,
I'm wondering if we could make the http_method_names property overrideable at runtime to support some special cases. I'm posting this question here (and not on the Django side) because, so far, I felt the need for such a feature only in the context of DRF.
My use case is pretty simple. I have a resource that can be in one of the two possible states: pending or finalized. Based on the resource state I am allowed or not to do some of the CRUD operations. For example finalized resources can only be read and updated but only within a small period after it was finalized. A pending resource can also be deleted. I would like my detail endpoint to reflect this restrictions in the Allow response header and of course in all the locations this property is used.
Is this feasible? Is this a good practice? Any thoughts? I'm willing to work on the patch, but wanted first to discuss about how this should be tackled.
Thanks!
