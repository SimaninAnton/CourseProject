Django's is_superuser doesn't appear to be respected by DRF.
Steps to reproduce
We have a ModelViewset with permissions.DjangoModelPermissions
user.is_superuser is True, whence user.has_perm('delete_foo') returns True irrespective of whatever is contained in user.get_all_permissions().
user tries to delete at /api/foo/1
Expected behavior
HTTP 204 No Content
Actual behavior
HTTP 403 Forbidden
(I just use delete as an example, same goes for other methods)
