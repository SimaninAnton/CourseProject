I didn't dig into the code, but when I set the 'api' DRF url as i18n_patterns, then I setup a detail_route on a ModelViewSet, with the methods=['get'], I don't have any error.
I get a 302 first then the /en/api/v2/.... and the right result.
If I change it to methods=['post'], I get a 302, then a 405 method not allowed.
If I change the i18n pattern to a regular patterns, I have no longer problems.
I didn't find any similar issue. Sorry if this is an intended behavior of DRF.
And thank you again for your work :)
