I'm currently working on a project that uses django_cassandra_engine and this package. Whenever I try to visit the json url I've set, django throws the error KeyError: 'Class UUID not found in lookup.'
I'm guessing because in my models, I'm using from cassandra.cqlengine import columns instead of from django.db import models. The UUID for cqlengine is just UUID while in django.db it's UUIDField.
Any work around for this?
