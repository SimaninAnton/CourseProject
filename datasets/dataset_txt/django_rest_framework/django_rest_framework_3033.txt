I posted a question on stack overflow about this as well.
Briefly, I am using DRF to serve an array of 500 dictionaries, which essentially no time to call in the django shell. I previously served it directly with postgresql and there was also no noticeable delay. In preparation for production, I am now serving it with DRF and notice a 1 - 2 second delay after the rest of the page has rendered. It should be noted that calling via the browseable API also takes 1 - 2 seconds.
I am NOT using a django cache at this point, but even so, the delay seems unusual. Is this normal?
