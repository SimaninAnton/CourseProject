I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Issues
Looking at https://www.django-rest-framework.org/, the newest version seems to be 3.9.1, however, under https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/releases, 3.8.2 is the latest release, and the tags for 3.9.0 and 3.9.1 are hidden.
Is this because these versions are not considered stable?
Furthermore, I seem to be unable to find a changelog mentioning the two versions.
Where is the official source for changelog on this project?
