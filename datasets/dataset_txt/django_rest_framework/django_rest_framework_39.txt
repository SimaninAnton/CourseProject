I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a project that uses a django 2.1.x PositiveIntegerField in the api. Use drf to generate an openapi spec
Expected behavior
the field should be represented as a type field of integer and there should be a format field of int64
Actual behavior
the field has type field of integer, but there is no format field of int64
