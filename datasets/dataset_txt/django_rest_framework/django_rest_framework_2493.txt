Our Django models have a required (but not editable in forms) field to record the user who created it. I believe this to be a valid model definition as the user should always be recorded, and it should never be edited in forms (when creating new objects, it is always provided by the view based on request.user):
class Foo(models.Model):
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(AUTH_USER_MODEL, editable=False)
With rest framework 2.3.14, we are now encountering an AssertionError when trying to serialize our model, even though created_by is not one of the fields listed on the ModelSerializer.Meta class:
Cannot set required=True and read_only=True
This is being raised in get_default_fields, which seems to be trying to create serializer fields for model fields not included in the Meta fields property.
Additionally, this particular serializer is only used by list and retrieve api views - so we don't care about it being required and non-editable.
We are not encountering this issue with 2.3.13.
