Version: 3.3.1
The documentation for versioning.URLPathVersioning (both the docstring and the API guide) provides the following example for the URL regex: r'^(?P<version>[v1|v2]+)/bookings/$'. Unless I am misunderstanding, I think that [v1|v2] is supposed to be (v1|v2), and that the + should be removed. Also, I am not sure whether it is customary to add a mandatory trailing slash or not.
(From git blame I see the regex was changed to the above in pull request #3037).
