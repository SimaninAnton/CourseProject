Hey there
while testing the user resource which has a generic RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
with PATCH I get '{"avatar": ["This field cannot be blank."]}', thing is, the patch works
i do it with javascript, what am i missing?
here follows the code i have in the serializer, models, api, and tests files
