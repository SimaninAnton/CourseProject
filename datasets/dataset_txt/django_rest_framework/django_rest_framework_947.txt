Hi, I was having a look at the code, and found something that might be a bug.
In MultiPartParser's parse method there is a named parameter parser_context set to None by default.
When this parameter is set to None it will be set to an empty dict, but in the next we try to access the request key from it, but this throws an (non helpful) error, since the dict is empty (in this case).
If the request in the parser_context is required maybe we should make it explicit?
class MultiPartParser(BaseParser):
     # [snip...]    

    def parse(self, stream, media_type=None, parser_context=None):
       # [snip...]    

       parser_context = parser_context or {}
       request = parser_context['request']

       # [snip...]
