I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
client = APIClient()
response = client.post(reverse('upload-images-list'), {}, format="json")

# and on the view
print(type(request.data))
Expected behavior
Expected output:
<class 'django.http.request.QueryDict'>
Actual behavior
Actual output:
<class 'dict'>
