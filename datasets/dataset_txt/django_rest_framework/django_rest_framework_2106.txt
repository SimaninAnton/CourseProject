I attempted to create a serializer field with the validators argument set to a string inside a tuple. Obviously this is incorrect, but it was not easy to debug because the stack trace shows that the error is coming from the post method on the view, not from the .is_valid call. If you call .is_valid directly, it throws the type error.
      organization = serializers.SlugRelatedField(                                 
          slug_field='slug',                                                       
          queryset=Organization.objects.all(),                                     
          required=True,                                                           
          validators=('validate_organization_unique',),           
      ) 
*** TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
