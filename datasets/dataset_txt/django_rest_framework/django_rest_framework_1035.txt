I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
There is no template code for displaying dicts in the admin console. Ideally this should mimic some of other templates for the admin console as to display the dict in a nice way.
