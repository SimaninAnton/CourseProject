I have got a model:
class Worker(models.Model):
user = models.OneToOneField(User, blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
...
and serializer:
class WorkerSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
user = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(view_name='user-detail')
class Meta:
model = Worker
fields = ('url', 'user', ...)
I would expect auto-rendered html POST/PUT form to include "null" or "None" for user field, since the relationship says: a worker may have associated user OR may not. Is my expectation right? or there is a reason that "null" is missed in dropdown list?
