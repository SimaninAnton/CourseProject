Steps to reproduce
I have 2 model , a user have multiple cars.
class User(Model):
          id = AutoField()
         name = CharField()

class Car(Model):
        id = AutoField()
       name = CharField()
       user = ForeignkeyField(User)
and two serializer for the 2 model
class UserSerilizer():
       car_set = CarSerilizer(many=True)
        class Meta:
                field = ('name', 'car_set')
Expected behavior
when I serializers the user with the cars.
it return all the cars associated with the user.
..but I only want to show top 2 cars..
Actual behavior
I want to limit the cars in the car set...how can I do that with serilizer...
