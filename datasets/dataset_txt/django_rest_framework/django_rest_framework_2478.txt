I saw bugs with many-to-many, but I did not find this bug listed:
This is what my Models look like:
class Person(models.Model):
    pass

class PersonMetadata(models.Model):
    person = models.ForeignKey(Person)
    value = models.CharField(max_length=50)
and the Serializers:
class PersonMetadataSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = PersonMetadata

class PersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    personmetadata_set = PersonMetadataSerializer(many=True, required=False)
    class Meta:
        model = Person
When I POST a new Person, I get:
{"personmetadata_set": [{"person": ["This field is required."]}]}
Which I assume should be set by the de-serializer. This seems to be an out order issue as far as object creation.
