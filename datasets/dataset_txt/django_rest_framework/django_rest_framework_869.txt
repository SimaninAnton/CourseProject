I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a ViewSet with an OrderingFilter and add a field to order on (field_name)
Call the viewset with ?ordering=--field_name
Expected behavior
No ordering to be applied
Actual behavior
Throws a 500 error because --field_name is passed to the queryset because over here an lstrip is done instead of just removing the first - character before validation.
