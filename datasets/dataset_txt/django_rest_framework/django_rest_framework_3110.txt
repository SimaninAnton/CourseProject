When ImmediateResponse (former ErrorResponse) is raised, if using a normal Django view, for now it just raises an exception - and fails to return a proper HttpResponse. So it would be cool to have a simple way of catching those and returning them as response. Suggestions :
a decorator to decorate dispatch or handlers
a middleware implementing process_exception
