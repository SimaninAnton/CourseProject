Hi! I'm packaging django-rest-framework for Arch Linux.
We usually use pypi as upstream for tracking updates and building from source.
It would be really cool, if the tests were available in the sdist tarball on pypi. Thanks!
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Download the sdist tarball from pypi.
Build: python setup.py build
Run pytest
Expected behavior
Be able to run pytest on the build, when using the sdist on pypi.
Actual behavior
Not being able to run the tests.
