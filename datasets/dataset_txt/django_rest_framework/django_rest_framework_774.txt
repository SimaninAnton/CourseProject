This is more of an idea than an issue with drf.
I would love to see some sort of customization options for the style of the documentation pages. The django admin app has blocks such as extra_style, branding, title etc. that allow injecting extra styles and content into the base layout of the admin page.
Example, adding a custom font and some css:
{% extends "docs/base.html" %}
{% load staticfiles %}
{% block extra_style %}
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Product+Sans" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="{% static 'css/docs.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" />
{% endblock %}
I am currently doing this by copying the entire docs/index.html template and editing that, but I think we can do it cleaner. I'd be more than willing to help out in making this possible if this is something that is deemed useful.
