It'd just be nice to be able to create a default router which, when included in a URL configuration file, will accept URLs without a trailing slash.
This is entirely the fault of Angular.js which strips the slashes off its URLs and doesn't show any sign of changing. There are other developers who have had the same problem. The main issue is that Angular will POST without the slash and Django can't redirect that.
I know that it's possible to have this by building a router from scratch and using custom URLs for everything but it seems like a very bad way of doing things.
Ideally, I'd like to be able to initialize my router with something like
router = routers.DefaultRouter(trailing_slash='optional')
router.register(r'Place', PlaceViewSet)
which would accept URLs of the form Place/?$ instead of Place/$
