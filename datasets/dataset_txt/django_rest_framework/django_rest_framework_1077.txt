Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Proposal
Hi, It's a proposal of SchemaGenerator.
Now, SchamaGenerator set only url, action, encoding and fields at following source code:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/schemas.py#L220-L242
I think it's very useful to set a docstring to a description of coreapi.Link like:
    def get_link(self, path, method, callback, view):
        """
        Return a `coreapi.Link` instance for the given endpoint.
        """
        :

        return coreapi.Link(
            url=urlparse.urljoin(self.url, path),
            action=method.lower(),
            encoding=encoding,
            fields=fields,
            description=callback.__doc__  # <= here
        )
