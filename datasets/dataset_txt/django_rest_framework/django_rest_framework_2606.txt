The UpdateModelMixin.get_object_or_none makes special case for PATCH & PUT. It works fine if one uses DefaultRouter.
It fails, e.g when using URL only router where all calls are in different urls, e.g.:
POST /users/create/
POST /users/update/
POST /users/update-partial/
POST /users/list/
etc...
I suppose I can overwrite the get_object_or_none but isn't the whole purpose of Routers that the underlying ViewSet isn't opinionated on router being used?
