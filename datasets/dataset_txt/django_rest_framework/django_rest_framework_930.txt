Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Send a GET request with a wrong Access Token, having permission settings as rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated
Expected behavior
Error message should be like "Authentication credential provided is Invalid" or "Invalid Access Token" or something like that.
Actual behavior
Error message says "Authentication credentials were not provided."
