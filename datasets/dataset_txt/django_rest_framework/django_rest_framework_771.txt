Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
After I create a user (myuser), if I want to create an auth token for it, I have to:
open a shell: ./manage.py shell
execute:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token

user = User.objects.get(username='myuser')
Token.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
Expected behavior
It would be useful to have something like:
./manage.py drf-token-create myuser
Token for user 'myuser' created: fasd8fgashfas8fygasfdyhasidfaoiufdgaf
Actual behavior
There is no such command.
Note
If there is enough interest for this feature and you think it may be useful for other people, I'm happy to code it in my spare time. I would be glad to finally contribute back to DRF with some code.
