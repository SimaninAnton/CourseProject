Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
None. Issue is with the trove classifiers in the https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/setup.py
Expected behavior
Have the trove classifiers to match the documented Django REST Framework Requirements in future releases:
Framework :: Django
Framework :: Django :: 1.8
Framework :: Django :: 1.9
Framework :: Django :: 1.10
Programming Language :: Python :: 2
Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7
Programming Language :: Python :: 3
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5
Actual behavior
Currently, the below are listed:
Framework :: Django
Programming Language :: Python
Programming Language :: Python :: 3
If doing filtering by the trove classifiers, it would be nice to see the exact versions of Django/Python supported. Additionally, it helps with third-party sites to list the correct requirements that are retrieved from the trove classifiers within the PyPI API (example).
