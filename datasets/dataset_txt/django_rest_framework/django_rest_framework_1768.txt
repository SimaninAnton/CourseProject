In docs of DRF only a line is mentioned on this which is given below,
If you're using a regular APIView, you'll need to call into the pagination API yourself to ensure you return a paginated response
I tried and my code is given below. Can someone give a clear reference or piece of code to clearly understand it.
My code
class StandardResultsSetPagination(PageNumberPagination):
    page_size = 1
    page_size_query_param = 'page_size'
    max_page_size = 1000
class EventList(APIView): 
    def get(self, request, format=None):
            filterargs = {} 
        filtered_event_list = Event.objects.filter(**filterargs)
        serializer = EventSerializer(filtered_event_list, many=True, context={'request': request})
        data = {'result': serializer.data}
        pagination_class = StandardResultsSetPagination
        return Response(data)
