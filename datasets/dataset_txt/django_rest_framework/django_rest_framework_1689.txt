Hello :-) The ‘Browsable API’ topic states, under ‘Blocks’: “footer - Any copyright notices or similar footer materials can go here (by default right-aligned).” However, I note that the relevant block was removed from the base template in 2ec0e74. Either the block needs to be reinstated or replaced by an equivalent, or the doc should be fixed. My personal preference would be to have a footer block available, but I'm new to drf and don't know the reasoning behind its removal.
