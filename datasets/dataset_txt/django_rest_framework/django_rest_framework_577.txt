I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a serializer with the below field, and submit the form in the browsable API with no content in the form field for the serializer field
    words = serializers.ListField(
        child=serializers.CharField(),
        allow_empty=True,
        required=False,
    )
Expected behavior
The validated_data entry for the field is either not present or an empty list.
Actual behavior
You get an error that "This field may not be blank".
This error message pertains the child CharField. Setting the child allow_blank=True results in a list with the empty string.
