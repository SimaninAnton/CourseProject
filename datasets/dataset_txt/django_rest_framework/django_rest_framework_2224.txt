Hi all,
I want to MOVE a resource to a new url, with UpdateModelMixin, but fail to do it.
The following is my script.
# my_com is a component name.
curl -X PUT -H "Content-type: application/json" http://127.0.01:8000/components/my_com/ -d '{"name": "new_my_com", "other": "blabla" }'
This request is most like moving resource than updating, and return 301 with new location /components/new_my_com/.
My expected response is:
# in http headers
Location: http://127.0.01:8000/components/new_my_com/

# response body
{"name": "new_my_com", "other": "blabla", "url": "http://127.0.01:8000/components/new_my_com/"}
but the actually is:
# response body
{"name": "my_com", "other": "blabla", "url": "http://127.0.01:8000/components/my_com/"}
I read the source code and find out the reason, it does not look like design for MOVE.
Will the django-rest-frame support MOVE in the future? Thanks.
