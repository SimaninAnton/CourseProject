Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
-- I haven't seen any documentation for this
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
-- I have searched
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
-- Usage-y, but feels more like a feature request
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
-- Does not seem like anyone does this
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
-- Pretty simple way to test this
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
-- No PR yet
Steps to reproduce
Class-based view or global permissions and/or authentication and decorator overriding on the function itself inside.
Run the URI request
Expected behavior
The authentication and permissions classes should be for that functional context, nothing class or global
Actual behavior
Only the class or global behavior (list of these permissions & authentications that are run)
Please let me know if you need clarity or more info.
