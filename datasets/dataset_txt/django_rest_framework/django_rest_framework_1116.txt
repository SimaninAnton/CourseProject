In Django, the following happens for the validation of a model field:
value = to_python(value)
run_validators(value)
reference
In my case, to_python is transforming from a JSON string to a dict.
Therefore the validators are not consistent depending whether it is called at the serializer level (via serializer.is_valid) or at the model level (via model.full_clean for instance).
I would love to know if there is a good way to reconcile.
Sorry if this is not the best place to post this question, but this seems like a "bug" to me, in that it does not allow to use validators how they were designed in plain Django
