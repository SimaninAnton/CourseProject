Sorry if I'm wrong with this, but if I set fields as read_only=True I'm expecting that those fields not to be included in writing requests as POST, PUT, PATCH.
Just to put some context, this is my scenario:
I have a Model with slug and name fields (both required).
I have a ModelSerializer with read_only_fields=(slug,)
I'm expecting slug to be showed in GET requests but do not sent slug in POST (slugs are set automatically when object is created).
The problem is that an error is raised: "slug field cannot be blank".
I cannot realize why fields marked as read_only=True are sent on POST requests. It does not have any sense for me (sorry if my intuition is wrong here).
Thanks.
