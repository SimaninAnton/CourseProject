I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Using DRF installed from github, Django 2.0.
Included the following at urls.py:
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('^api/token-auth/', authtoken_views.obtain_auth_token)
    path('^docs/', include_docs_urls(title='API Docs', authentication_classes=[], permission_classes=[], public=True)),
    ...
]
Expected behavior
Urls in docs should api/endpoint-name/
Actual behavior
Urls are api\/endpoint\-name/, when using the "interact" button you get a 404 (request URL is /api%5C/profiles/)
