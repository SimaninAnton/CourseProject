I have a Model with :
PENDING = 1
COMPLETE = 2
CANCELLED = 3
STATUS = (
    (PENDING, 'Pending'),
    (COMPLETE, 'Complete'),
    (CANCELLED, 'Cancelled'),
)
(...)
status = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=COMPLETE, choices=STATUS)
And when I perform a PUT (update) on that model (using the default ModelSerializer) with the following JSON :
{"id":8,"status":3,"t_type":1,"description":"Transaction example"}
I get the following error message :
"status" : "Select a valid choice. 3 is not one of the available choices."
Which it clearly is.
