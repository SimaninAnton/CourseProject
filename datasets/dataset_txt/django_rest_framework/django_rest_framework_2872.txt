Hello,
When I switch the bootstrap theme, the navbar is always the same (default.css overrides it). What's the point of using bootstrap themes if we cannot fully integrate any? Is there a reason for this? Should we "fix" default.css so it only touches non-theme styles so we can easily switch theme and get the expected behavior?
Thanks!
