I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Using version 3.10.1.
Have a SerializerMethodField with this implementation
    def get_some_url(self, instance):
        return "http://example.com/foo%2fbar"
Open the endpoint in the Browsable API.
Expected output
<a href="http://example.com/foo%2fbar" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/foo%2fbar</a>
Actual output
<a href="http://example.com/foo/bar" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/foo%2fbar</a>
For some reason, DRF decided to alter the URL in the href attribute. This makes the link broken.
