rest_framework.templatetags.rest_framework is non-conditionally importing markdown.
from markdown.extensions.fenced_code import FencedBlockPreprocessor

from rest_framework.compat import (
    NoReverseMatch, markdown, reverse, template_render
)
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/templatetags/rest_framework.py#L12-L16
As per the compat import markdown has previously been an optional dependency. It's still listed as an optional requirement
Without markdown installed, the template tags can no longer be imported. cf carltongibson/django-filter#658
Markdown either needs to be declared required or a work around is needed.
