The select combo boxes don't take existing values into account for select widgets. This means that users don't see the selected value in the update view.
The test at https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/templates/rest_framework/horizontal/select.html#L11 is failing because:
key is a string
field.value is an integer
