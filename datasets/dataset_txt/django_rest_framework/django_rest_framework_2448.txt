Ember is a bit peculiar about the type of responses it likes:
http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter/#toc_sideloaded-relationships
The idea is similar to:
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations#primarykeyrelatedfield
However it also includes the data for the related fields.
Is there a recommended route for implementing this?
I was thinking about sub-classing the Primary Key Related Field serializer or maybe the ItemSerializer
