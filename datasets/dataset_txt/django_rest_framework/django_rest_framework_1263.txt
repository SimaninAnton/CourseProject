In ModelSerializer it is catching TypeError and saying a possibility of why that TypeError might be happening.

I've ran into this a couple times and for me it has always been misleading. The first time I ran into it, I took its suggestion but it turned out being something unrelated. I've ran into it a couple more times and have disregarded it and even commented it out locally so I can see the actual error and stacktrace.
It's misleading because when you have code tied to the create method (i.e. overriding save) and you have an error in the create code, the actual error is squashed and you can't see where the error is happening.
I'm not sure on the history of this, or if it has been useful to others, but for me it would be more useful to let the error happen instead of catching it and suggesting what the error might be. It does give the original error text, but it eliminates the stacktrace of where the error is actually happening which is a pain when the error is actually happening in overriding the create method.
