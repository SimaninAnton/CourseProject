A line in API-Guide documentation demos a snippet of code. I felt the need to add import statement for parser_classes too. Somewhat like this.
Or, if you're using the @api_view decorator with function based views.
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.decorators import parser_classes
