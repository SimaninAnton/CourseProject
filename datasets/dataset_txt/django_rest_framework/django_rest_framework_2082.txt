I have a model with a foreign key reference to the User model called 'user'. In my serializer class, which is a sub-class of ModelSerializer, I have overridden the default field created by ModelSerializer and set it to:
user = serializers.HiddenField(default=serializers.CurrentUserDefault())
When displaying the fields in the API response, this field is indeed hidden, but in the web browsable API page, the HTML form shows a textbox for the user field which is supposed to be hidden.
Here is my serializer definition:
class CategorySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = serializers.HiddenField(default=serializers.CurrentUserDefault())
    class Meta:
        model = Category
        fields = ('name', 'description', 'created', 'modified','user')
Please see the screenshot illustrating the HTML form with an input for the hidden field.
I am totally new to Django REST Framework, so sorry if I haven't RTFM and raised this issue.
