During the sprints of DjangoCon I've made the browsable api working again. Yet the implementation is somewhat hacky as @tomchristie put it. And I agree totally.
I'm working on making this better. I'd like to discuss any questions that come up in this issue.
EDIT: Some improvements have made it in, so now changing title of ticket to better reflect remaining work.
