I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Rest framework conf
'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
 ),
angular request header
headers: {
 "X-CSRFToken": undefined (I can not get csrftoken string anywhere before login)
},
withCredentials: true
Response from django rest-auth login api
{
    "detail": "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect."
}
Expected behavior
successful login
Actual behavior
If l remove x-csrftoken and withcredentials from request header, login succeed but after login I can't access to all authenticated apis as cookies not updated.
If I add x-csrftoken and withcredentials to request header, login failed.
