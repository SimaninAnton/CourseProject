Hello,
I've been trying to get some simple tests with djangorestframework and have noticed that
def pre_save(self, obj):
print "adding user to object! %s "%self.request.user.username
obj.userfrom = self.request.user
inside an a viewlass will do nothing when the serializer.save() is called for that view.
I'm not sure if I'm missing something entirely . Thus serialization will have userfrom = none
The documentation specifically puts this within the view definition though the django documentation seems to refer using this within the model.
