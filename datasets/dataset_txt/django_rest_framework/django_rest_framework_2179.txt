There is no background on DRF 2.4 docs. As far as I can see, since there's no home page link in the navbar on the left, something is broken with detecting that the index is the home page and applying the right style. Background is broken for all pages though.
It might also be worth updating the screenshot on DRF 3.0 docs because it has 2.0.0 in the header.
