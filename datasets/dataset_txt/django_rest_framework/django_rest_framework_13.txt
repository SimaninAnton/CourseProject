I am going to upload image on json.
e.g Postman request.
{
    "username": "is690002",
    "password": "is690002",
    "first_name": "andres ",
    "last_name": "Barragan",
    "email": "zaturoz.marco@gmail.com",
    "userprofile": {
        "gender": "F",
        "phone_number": "3315854644",
        "photo": "/media/image.png"
    }
}
I noticed DRF doesn't support uploading file on json.
Is there anyway to implement it?
