I have a sub-class of auth.User, which I have exposed an API for.
When I attempt to POST valid data to the ListOrCreateModelView, it fails when attempting to add groups, which are an m2m relation.
I'm looking into a patch where I do the m2m stuff after creating the instance, but it will almost certainly need testing against other stuff: this is my first foray into django-rest-framework.
