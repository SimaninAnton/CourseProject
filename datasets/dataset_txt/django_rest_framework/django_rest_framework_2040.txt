I have the following field in a serializer.
image = fields.ImageField(use_url=True, required=False)
But when i try to update the the object (by PUT method) and I do not provide an image, the following error show up.
{
    "image": [
        "The submitted data was not a file. Check the encoding type on the form."
    ]
}
Maybe I am misunderstanding the required option, is there a way that the image field not be required?
Checking the following code, I am asking me to myself if is there missing checking if the field is required or not before the try?
def to_internal_value(self, data):
        try:
            # `UploadedFile` objects should have name and size attributes.
            file_name = data.name
            file_size = data.size
        except AttributeError:
            self.fail('invalid')
