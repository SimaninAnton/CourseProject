Today I found that the serializer DateTimeField does not support null values, even when you set allow_null=True. I ended up making a copy of the DRF implementation (somehow, DRF does not let you derive new classes from existing Serial Field classes??) and adding two lines to the to_internal_value() method. It looks like this:
   def to_internal_value(self, value):
        # allow None as text string since json encodes it that way                                                                 
        if value == 'None':
            return None
        ... rest of the original function ...
I'm not sure if this was the right way to fix it but it should give you an idea what the bug is about.
