With 3.0 we now have a template based form rendering for serializers.
This has basically everything it needs to serve as a fully fledged alternative to django forms.
I'm also currently planning for it to be compatible with use in eg. Django's standard class based views.
(So for example, we'll need to provide a files keyword argument for cross-compatibility)
The API for all this still needs to be made public, documented, and any rough edges ironed out.
In order to not block the 3.0 release I'm milestoning this to 3.1 - there's no reason that this needs to become public API straight away, better to take an incremental approach.
In particular we should document how to create alternate template packs.
