I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Allowed Versions: v1, v2
Default Version: v2 (It's latest version as often)
My URL Pattern: api/((?P<version>(\w){2})/)?users/
Expected behavior
1- When GET api/v1/users/: get users data according to version v1.
2- When GET api/users/ : get users data according to Default-Version.
Actual behavior
for Case 1: get users data according to version v1.
for Case 2: get 404 error: "Invalid version in URL path."
I think it makes sense when client didn't specified version in URI, he expects get response from latest version as often (not getting error)!
