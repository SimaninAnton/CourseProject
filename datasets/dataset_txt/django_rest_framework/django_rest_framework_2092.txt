In case a custom user model is implemented without a username (in my case I only rely on the user email address as the primary field), Token Authentication does not work with the error:
{"username":["This field is required."]}
The code that raises this error is in django-rest-framework/rest_framework/authtoken/serializers.py
if username and password:
            user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
I have edited this file to corresponds to my specific case, but I suppose that it is better to have a general solution; thus the creation of this ticket.
Thanks for the great work
