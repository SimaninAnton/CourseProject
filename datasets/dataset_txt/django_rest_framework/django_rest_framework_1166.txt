Steps to reproduce
Create an API key using ObtainAuthToken
Perform a SELECT in the database, the API key is there in clear text
Expected behavior
API keys should be hashed before storing in the database
Since performance is a very important requirement hashing algorithms such as PBKDF2 or BCrypt can't be implemented in this scenario. I would recommend using SHA256 with a strong / randomly generated salt. The problem with this salt is that it can't be different for each user (which would be much better) so I recommend using Django's SECRET_KEY as salt.
Actual behavior
API keys are stored in clear text
