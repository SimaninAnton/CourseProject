I am posting the following:
[{
"given_name": "zz",
"middle_name": "zz",
"last_name": "zz"
},
{
"given_name": "zz",
"middle_name": "zz",
"last_name": "zz"
}]
to a generics.ListCreateAPIView view which has a ModelSerializer as its serializer.
There does not seem to be an easy way to make many=True and all my attempts of slotting it in somehow are failing.
How can I do a bulk create using a ModelSerializer and a ListCreateAPIView? There does not seem to be any examples in the docs. Is this not possible?
