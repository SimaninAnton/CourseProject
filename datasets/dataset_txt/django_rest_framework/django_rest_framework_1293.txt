Issue #2878 resulted in a fix where the error message for the key 'unique' set on a model, was used by the serializer validator.
Would it not be better to also use the value set in the serializers extra_kwargs, in case you do no want to define it on model itself?
In this example the new unique message is not respected, and I believe it should be:
class CustomerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Customer
        extra_kwargs = {
            "email": {
                "error_messages": {
                    "unique": "ERROR_EMAIL_TAKEN"
                }
            }
        }
