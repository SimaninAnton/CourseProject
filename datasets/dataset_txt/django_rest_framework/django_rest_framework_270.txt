Hi guys,
I am using drf default token authentication. But there's weird behaviour which i am facing. It get unauthorized randomly on some incoming request and If i check token of unauthorized request it is same with the token of request which returned 200. Please help me out.
My request header is like Authorization: Token
Here is my settings.py file containing.
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
)}
Thanks
