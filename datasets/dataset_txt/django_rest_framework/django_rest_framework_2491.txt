This seems a bit odd to me that when I OPTION a url, I get back fields that are read_only under the POST section. Given that the field is read-only, the user cannot POST that value:
    "actions": {
        "POST": {
            "departments": {
                "type": "field", 
                "required": false, 
                "read_only": true
            },
