Checklist
[x ] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Files:
proj
-app
-templates
--rest_framework
----api.html
-proj
--settings.py
api.html
{% extends "rest_framework/base.html" %}


{% block bootstrap_theme %}
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bootswatch.com/4/flatly/bootstrap.css" type="text/css">
{% endblock %}


{% block branding %}
    <a class="navbar-brand" rel="nofollow" href="#">
        My Title
    </a>
{% endblock %}
settings.py
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
Expected behavior
Breadcrumb should be rendered properly.
GET button should be in proper place.
Navbar should be rendered properly.
