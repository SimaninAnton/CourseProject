As per the 3.0 release, we now get AssertionErrors if we pass in a method name that matches the default:
AssertionError: It is redundant to specify `get_id_salted` on SerializerMethodField 'id_salted' in serializer 'UserSerializer', because it is the same as the default method name. Remove the `method_name` argument.
I can certainly see an argument for this sort of thing, but I subjectively prefer to be as explicit as possible, even if it comes at the cost of a few extra keystrokes. At any time, our team has external contractors (who may or may not have worked with DRF before) coming in and out, so this is one of those little easy hints we can give them. That arg (even if it's not needed anymore) provides some additional context for someone who is getting their bearings.
Would you accept a PR with a setting to disable this assertion? It'd help with those of us who prefer to be very explicit, and would also improve the migration path for those who don't care to make this change for many hundreds of serializer fields in larger codebases.
