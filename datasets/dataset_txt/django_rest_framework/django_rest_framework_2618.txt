Using django_rest_framework 2.3.12 version
When using a DefaultRouter and adding two viewsets with the same model you have a problem with the api root page. It shows both viewsets having the same path, even when you define them with a different path.
My case is as follows:
ViewSets -> viewset1, viewset2(inherits from viewset1, so it uses the same model)
router.register(r'path1', views.viewset1)
router.register(r'path2', views.viewset2)
but in the api root page I see both viewsets with the same path. This is happening because the "get_default_base_name" method in "routers.py". You can solve this issue by giving a "base_name" when registering the viewset with the router.
I have checked that I can solve the problem by changing the "return model_cls._meta.object_name.lower()" line with the line "return viewset.name", that returns the name of the viewset and not the name of the model.
I need this because I have created viewset2 using a custom authentication method (it will be used by some autonomous devices), while viewset1 is for common usage (default authentication method).
