I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
when using format_suffix_patterns() from the rest_framwork.urlpatterns class, it should format the url pattern for url() from django.conf.urls as well as the newly introduced path() from django.urls
Actual behavior
getting an error when using path() in urlpatterns[], and then formatting it using the format_suffix_patterns() method
