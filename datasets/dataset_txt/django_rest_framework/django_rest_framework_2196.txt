Just like Django's ModelForm allow a save(commit=False) ModelSerializer should allow this argument as well.
We didn't need it before because we could access the serializer.object. As for 3.0, the serializer.instance will be exist before save has been called and it'll be in the database after that regardless of the developer's motivation.
