I am using the AcceptHeaderVersioning and like to write some tests. At the moment i do it this way:
.put(url, **{'HTTP_ACCEPT': 'application/json; version=1'})
But i would like to write the code like this
.put(url, format='json', version='1')
Whats the correct way atm? I could not find anything related to testing a AcceptHeaderVersioning Api.
