Hello,
Faced problem hard to explain. As you could see from the excerpt below there a Serializer for a model with two fields for object Currency. As you also could get from the picture below there a request for partial update of one of the currency field. Instead of update it causes exception %subj%.
Any ideas what's could be wrong?
class CurrencyExchangeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    currency_from = PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Currency.objects.all())
    currency_to = PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Currency.objects.all())
    date = DateTimeTzAwareField()
    class Meta:
        model = CurrencyExchange
        fields = ('id','default','currency_from', 'currency_to','date','rate')
