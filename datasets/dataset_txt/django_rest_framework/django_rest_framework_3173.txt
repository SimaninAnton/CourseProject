url(r'^([0-9]+)/$', InstanceModelView.as_view(resource=MyModelResource)),
should be
url(r'^(?P[0-9]+)/$', InstanceModelView.as_view(resource=MyModelResource)),
to avoid 'NoReverseMatch' Error
Cheers
p.s. Not sure why but the issue edit box seems to not display (?P[0-9]+) correctly, there should be "less than id greater than" between the 'P' and '['. However if I go to 'update issue' it is still there, some meta/escape code weirdness shrug
