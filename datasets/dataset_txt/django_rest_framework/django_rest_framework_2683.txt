in rest_framework/fields.py:
class URLField(CharField):
    type_name = 'URLField'
    type_label = 'url'

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        kwargs['validators'] = [validators.URLValidator()]
        super(URLField, self).__init__(**kwargs)
Because of this code, validators of URLField cannot be overrided and for do this, I need to inherit the URLField class. Maybe it better should look like this?
class URLField(CharField):
    type_name = 'URLField'
    type_label = 'url'

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        if not 'validators' in kwargs:
            kwargs['validators'] = [validators.URLValidator()]
        super(URLField, self).__init__(**kwargs)
Sorry for my bad english)
