Hello!
I have a django application with django-rest-framework and Android application.
I want to generate JSON-Schema from my API fitting for jsonschema2pojo.org.
It means I want structure with properties like following
{
  "type":"object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "bar": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "baz": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  }
}
I know about coreapi but it generates another schema.
