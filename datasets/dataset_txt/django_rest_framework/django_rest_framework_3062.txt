Hi, it seems that the DeserializedObject returned by ModelSerializer has problems saving an object that has problems with DateTimeFields that has auto_now_add, I get blog_comment.created may not be NULL when REST framework tries to save it, with the following code:
class Comment(models.Model):        
    email = models.EmailField()
    content = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
class CommentSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        exclude = ('created',)
class CommentView(ListCreateAPIView):

    serializer_class = CommentSerializer
    model = Comment
Maybe ModelSerializer's .get_field*() functions should pass and handle Django's models.*Field's **kwargs?
