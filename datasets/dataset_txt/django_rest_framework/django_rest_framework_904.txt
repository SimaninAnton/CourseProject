Ought instead check isinstance(thing, collections.Mapping)
https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html#collections.Mapping
Example here:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/300e46a9e5798ca56f56ba231de3d3fded860551/rest_framework/serializers.py#L445
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
from chainmap import ChainMap   #  py 2.7. py3: from collections import ChainMap
from rest_framework import serializers

class FooSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
     bar = serializers.CharField()

cm = ChainMap({'bar': 'molp'})

FooSerializer(data=cm).is_valid()  # False
Expected behavior
Works same as dictionaries
Actual behavior
(400, {u'non_field_errors': [u'Invalid data. Expected a dictionary, but got ChainMap.']})
