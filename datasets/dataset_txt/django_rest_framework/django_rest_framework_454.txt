When i use "Interact" button in interactive API documentation, i cannot get coreapi work only via https. Website have SSL, but it's not helping at all. All requests into API use only http, and Chrome block it as Mixed content.
I tried to google the solution, but nothing can help, except turn off https redirect in nginx settings.
Can i specify in the code which mode i want to use?
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://example.com/docs/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://example.com/api/profiles/'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
