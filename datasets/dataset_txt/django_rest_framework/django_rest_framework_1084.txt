Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Using the example from the current docs, if providing multiple search methods on a field then the field is rendered multiple times in the filter form html. Given the example below, two copies of the 'category' field will be rendered for each filter type.
import django_filters
from myapp.models import Product
from myapp.serializers import ProductSerializer
from rest_framework import filters
from rest_framework import generics

class ProductFilter(filters.FilterSet):
    min_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(name="price", lookup_expr='gte')
    max_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(name="price", lookup_expr='lte')
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = {
                'category': ['exact', 'contains'], 
                'in_stock': ['exact'],
                'min_price': ['exact'],
                'max_price': ['exact']:
        }

class ProductList(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
    filter_backends = (filters.DjangoFilterBackend,)
    filter_class = ProductFilter
Expected behavior
A single field should be rendered. An for the match type should be given as drop down or other form element.
Actual behavior
Multiple fields rendered confusingly to the end user.
