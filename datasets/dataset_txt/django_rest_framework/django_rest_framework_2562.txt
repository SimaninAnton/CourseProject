I have a nested serializer (with many=True and allow_add_remove=True, but the issue also exists with allow_add_remove=False) that does not allow updating existing records. Whenever I send data to the object containing the nested serializer in which I update nested records (I do send the ID of the nested objects), new objects are created. In my case this fails because of some uniqueness constraints, but without these constrains new objects are created.
