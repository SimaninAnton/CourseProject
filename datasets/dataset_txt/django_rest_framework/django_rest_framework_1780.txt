django-rest-framework has very simple TokenAuthentication system. Can we add auto rotate function. Let's say, Token has infinite life by default. User has choice to define life in setting.
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
'TOKEN_LIFE' : '36'
}
This will cause the token to renew after 36 hours creation. If you guys think, I can improve rest_framework.authtoken.
Thanks
