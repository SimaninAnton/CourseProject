Hello there,
I first want to thank all of you for this really nice job you've done !
I am wondering if there is a way to set a counter for each API users in order to limit the object viewed count. For example, my API exposes some mails, I want to let an access to 50 mails / API users. Is that kind of permission is available ?
Thanks !
Ben
