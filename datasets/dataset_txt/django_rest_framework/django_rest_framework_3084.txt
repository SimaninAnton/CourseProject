JSONRenderer is currently hardcoded to use DateTimeAwareJSONEncoder. It would be great if this was configurable, perhaps with a serializer_class attribute. This would make it fairly trivial to subclass JSONRenderer and override the serializer_class with a custom one, without having to override the whole render() method.
serializer_class would just be passed directly to the cls keyword arg of json.dumps().
Happy to submit a pull request if you agree.
