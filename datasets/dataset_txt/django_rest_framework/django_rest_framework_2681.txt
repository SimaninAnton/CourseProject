The title pretty much sums it up,
The documentation lacks an example how to handle a FK to "self" which would be great to have.
How to include them as a RelatedField is pretty straight forwards even though it isnt mentioned, but how do you render them recursivly as you cannot specify the Serializer class as a field in it self.
