Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Go to: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/
See third paragraph that starts with:
Note: The code for this tutorial is available in the tomchristie/rest-framework-tutorial repository on GitHub
Click the link: tomchristie/rest-framework-tutorial
It tries to go to: https://github.com/encode/rest-framework-tutorial and does, but gets a 404 error
Expected behavior
Expect to be taken to the source code for the tutorial
Actual behavior
Goes to GitHub at: https://github.com/encode/rest-framework-tutorial and there is nothing there, so it shows 404 error screen.
