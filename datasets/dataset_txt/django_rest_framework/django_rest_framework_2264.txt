In 2.4.x, BasePaginationSerializer used to propagate the context to the object serializer. This is no longer the case in 3.x. Is it a design choice or just a bug? If it is a bug, the fix is really simple, just pass the BasePaginationSerializer context kwarg down to the object_serializer:
  context_kwarg = kwargs.get('context', {})

  self.fields[results_field] = serializers.ListSerializer(
       child=object_serializer(context=context_kwarg),
       source='object_list',
   )
