Checklist
[X ] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[X ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[X ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[ X] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[ X] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a class View:
class MyControlller(APIView):
    def post(self, request, format=None):
        myData = request.data.get("anything")
Expected behavior
Return the data sent through form.
Actual behavior
Throws an exception RawPostDataException
If I change APIView to View and request.data to request.POST everything works correct, so I think DRF is reading the body somewhere.
