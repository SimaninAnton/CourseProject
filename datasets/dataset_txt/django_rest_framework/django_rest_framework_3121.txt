This is a feature proposal rather than a bug report.
I think it would be nice if the docstrings on the various HTTP handler methods were displayed in the (X)HTML/TEXT rendered version of an API endpoint. Currently, the view's docstring is converted to HTML via Markdown, then displayed at the top of the endpoint's HTML representation.
I would propose that in addition to this, the docstrings for get, post, put, delete, options etc. are also displayed on this page. Currently there is a section for each method (which displays the resource's form for PUT/POST requests) but no chance to document these methods individually. For example:
class MyView(View):
    """This docstring documents the MyView API endpoint.
    This is formatted and displayed in a browser."""

    def get(self, request):
        """This docstring documents the GET method of the MyView API endpoint.
        I would like to see this receive the same treatment."""
If this sounds like a useful extension to the self-documenting API feature, let me know and I will send a pull request.
