I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Install django 2.0 with latest version of django-rest-framework via pip, and activate in settings.py
Try to open a shell and/or do:
from rest_framework.authtoken import views
Expected behavior
Should just load the views module.
Actual behavior
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'coreapi'
Suggested fix
It seems like the coreapi module should no longer be optional, but should be a dependency that installs with a pip install -

 coreapi==2.3.1
