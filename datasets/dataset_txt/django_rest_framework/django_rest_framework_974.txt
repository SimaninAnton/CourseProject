I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Use more than one class in REST_FRAMEWORK.DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES, where the first class does not implement authenticate_header().
Expected behavior
Drf should try all declared authentication classes to find a valid challenge header.
Actual behavior
Drf calls only the first object(return authenticators[0].authenticate_header(request))
