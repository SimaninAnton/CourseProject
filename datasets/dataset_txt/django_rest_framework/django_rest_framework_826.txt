I have searched but I am not able to find anything about this... I am not sure if this is an issue, or by design, but the awesome functionality of the "OPTIONS" button in browsable API, is not available in the documentation pages (which are also awesome BTW). It would be VERY helpful to have ALL of that data, especially field type available in the documentation (I see that Parameter name and Description are already there).
Just to be clear, I am referring to the separate auto-created docs pages (which I believe are COREAPI). It would make the documentation pages more useful if they included ALL of the details about the fields, or at least the ability to enable them. Specifically I am referring this this (from OPTIONS), here is the actions section of the OPTIONS data for a given view:
"actions": {
    "GET": {
        "url": {
            "type": "field",
            "required": false,
            "read_only": true,
            "label": "Url"
        },
        "is_active": {
            "type": "boolean",
            "required": false,
            "read_only": false,
            "label": "Is active",
            "help_text": "Enable/Disable"
        },
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "required": true,
            "read_only": false,
            "label": "Name",
            "help_text": "Enter a unique name",
            "max_length": 254
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "required": false,
            "read_only": false,
            "label": "Description",
            "help_text": "Expanded description of the item",
            "max_length": 254
        },
        "note": {
            "type": "string",
            "required": false,
            "read_only": false,
            "label": "Note",
            "help_text": "Additional notes"
        }
    }
}
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
