I've been wrestling with how to encode my ManyToManyField for a couple days. One thing that makes it very difficult is the lack of any example in the documentation. It's also frustrating that all the documentation on relations uses the same, reverse relation example: tracks. So it's not even clear to me how to code up a forward relation and get the nested lists like the tracks lists. Could someone add
a) a forward relation example?
b) a ManyToMany example?
c) more clarification to the ManyToMany section about the implications of setting the read_only flag and some hint about whether it is possible to get write behavior on ManyToMany fields with custom classes and some hint about how to go about that?
Note that I'm about to give up on any nested representation of ManyToMany slugs and use a custom serializer to code up the list as a flat string. I am also finding little documentation on how to create a custom field class, though.
