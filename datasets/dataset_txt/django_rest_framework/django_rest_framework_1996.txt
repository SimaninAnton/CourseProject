When doing the following:
def put(self, request, pk, format=None):
        event = self.get_event(request, pk)
        event_serializer = CalendarEventSerializer(event, data=request.data, partial=True)

        if event_serializer.is_valid():
            event_serializer.save()
            return Response(event_serializer.data)
Reponse returns dict that does not show updated data. I had to do this for a workaround to make sure data is updated.
event_serializer._data = event_serializer.to_representation(event_serializer.instance)
I've tried tracing down the issue but can't seem to find it. The _date seems to be using is_initial values as everything else is correct within the serializer instance.
