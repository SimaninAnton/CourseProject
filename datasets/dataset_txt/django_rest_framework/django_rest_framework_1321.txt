I want to create such viewset:
class MyViewSet(RetrieveModelMixin, GenericViewSet):

    #blah blah...

    @list_route(['GET'])
    def some_action(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # do stuff...
My model has string primary keys.
Generated with DefaultRouter URL regexes list looks like this:
^api/resource/some_action/
^api/resource/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/
If my model instance will have pk equal to "some_action", this instance will be inaccessible through api.
I see the solution in adding some prefix before lookup portion:
^api/resource/some_action/
^api/resource/~(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/
It would be nice if DefaultRouter will support such feature.
