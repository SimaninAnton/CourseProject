Currently if the search query parameter is empty when using SearchFilter, no filtering occurs, i.e. the original queryset is returned. This is the same behavior as omitting the query parameter entirely. I suggest having an option such that if the query parameter is set to nothing e.g. ?search= as 400 error should be raised.
This would be consistent with what github does: https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=.
Implementation would around in this line.
