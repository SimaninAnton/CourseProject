In 2.x save_object was documented as follows:
You can override the default save behaviour by overriding the .save_object(obj) method on the serializer class.
save_object is no longer available in 3.x. Whilst it's not a big issue to override save, create or update depending on your need, it might be worth mentioning in the release notes to ease migration?
