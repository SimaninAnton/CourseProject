I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add an option such as read_only or help_text to a serializer field using the extra_kwargs Meta option on the serializer, and check the Core API schema generated from this serializer.
Expected behavior
The read_only or help_text values should be reflected in the generated schema.
Actual behavior
Options added in this way don't appear to be recognised when the schema is generated.
Sorry, I looked for an existing issue for this but it was difficult to search for. I'm actually not sure if I've gotten the expected behaviour right here or not, so I thought I'd check first before trying to put together a fix.
Thanks!
