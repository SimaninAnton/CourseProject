I'm trying to remove the database from my Django site. This includes removing dependencies on django.contrib, such as django.contrib.sessions and django.contrib.contenttypes. However, this seems to break DRF: my site only started working again when DRF was also removed.
I understand if DRF needs those django.contrib apps, but it would be nice if the dependencies on django.contrib were documented, e.g. "if you use any of the DRF authentication features, then django.contrib.auth and django.contrib.sessions are required", etc, etc.
