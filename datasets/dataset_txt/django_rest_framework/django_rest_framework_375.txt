I have a mixin which sets a few fields as read-only but only for some specific actions, printing out extra_kwargs shows the mixin is intercepting and changing these correctly for the serializer instance when the appropriate action is performed yet the read_only nature is not being enforced at all.
How can I invalidate/refresh serializer._writable_fields so I can do that before I call serializer.save()
Usage of multiple serializers has been suggested but this would not be the solution we would want as that would result in an explosion on the number of serializers we have so we would instead prefer to go with intelligent serializers via mixins.
