I've started working on CoreAPI 3.0, which...
Simplify things by only support API Schemas, not Hypermedia generally.
Include a typesystem built-in, for use when specifying parameters and response types. (No more coreschema)
Built-in support for OpenAPI. (No third party codec anymore.)
Client lib instantiated with a document, so you don't need to include the doc on each action, and instead just use: client.action(['users', 'create_user'], params={})
We might also support response schemas in 3.0.
Given the improved support we'll end up with for OpenAPI, I'd like to see us include a schema management command with REST framework, that dumps out an API schema.
Tasks will be:
Implement this against our current schema generation. (We can do this now)
Map serializers and other field types to the new built-in typesystem, rather than coreschema types. (Do we issue a release of coreapi before we start that? If not how do we best work on it?)
The entire CoreAPI docs site will need a refresh too.
