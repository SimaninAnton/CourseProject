I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
>>> class S(serializers.Serializer):
...    d = serializers.DateField()
Expected behaviour
>>> S(data={'d': '2018'}).is_valid()
True
Based on the error message:
'Date has wrong format. Use one of these formats instead: YYYY[-MM[-DD]].'
Actual behaviour
>>> S(data={'d': '2018'}).is_valid()
True
Note that optional month/days are not being tested:
django-rest-framework/tests/test_fields.py
Lines 1120 to 1123 in c2b24f8
 valid_inputs = { 
     '2001-01-01': datetime.date(2001, 1, 1), 
     datetime.date(2001, 1, 1): datetime.date(2001, 1, 1), 
 } 
I think what I'd actually expect is the current behaviour, in which case it's the error message that's incorrect. But I don't know which is intended.
