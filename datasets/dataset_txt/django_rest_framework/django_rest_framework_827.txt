As I was working with metadata to add some custom stuff, I noticed that the (very helpful) action section was missing on my read-only models. Even for read-only models, it is very helpful to have the data types documented in OPTIONS, so consumers of the API can know what data to expect. To work around this, I had to override determine_actions to change:
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/metadata.py#L80
from:
for method in {'PUT', 'POST'} & set(view.allowed_methods):
to:
for method in {'PUT', 'POST', 'GET'} & set(view.allowed_methods):
Per this, I am just recommending that this be the default.
