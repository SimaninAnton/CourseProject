Hi, I am using REST framework v3.1.1 and I noticed that BooleanFields on the HTML form inside the
browsable API does not take effect and change the data as expected.
To reproduce:
Make a serializer with some boolean fields
In the browsable API's HTML form, try to edit the boolean checkbox
Compare the result returned with the expected output
Every time I have to explicitly change the values in the raw data for the expected change to occur
before the POST and PUT request is made
