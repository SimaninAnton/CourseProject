on the Generic Views page, the documentation says:
These hooks are particularly useful for setting attributes that are implicit in the request, but are not part of the request data. For instance, you might set an attribute on the object based on the request user, or based on a URL keyword argument.
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    serializer.save(user=self.request.user)
In that case, if if the model has as required user field, the above code will actually raise a validation error, because the serializer validation is called before perform_create is call called in the create function. I was able to solve this problem by overriding the create function like so:
def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
     request.data['user'] = request.user.id
     return super(NewArticleView,self).create(request,*args,**kwargs)
Which ensures that the user is added to the data before serializer validation. Is it worth added a note to the documentation about this? Going off the documentation alone, it wasn't clear to me that validation had already been called until I dug into the actual source code of the class.
