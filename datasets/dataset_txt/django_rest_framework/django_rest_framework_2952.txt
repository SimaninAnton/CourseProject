The models code snippet in the tutorial at http://django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization.html throws an error with Pygments 1.6rc (latest). Resolved by installing with pygments==1.5, but tutorial code potentially requires updating.
File "/Users/foo/tutorial/snippets/models.py", line 7, in <module>
    LANGUAGE_CHOICES = sorted([(item[1][0], item[0]) for item in get_all_lexers()])
IndexError: tuple index out of range
