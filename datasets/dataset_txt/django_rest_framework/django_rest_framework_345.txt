I need this for consistent look & feel with the rest of my site. I'm working on it myself and will submit a PR if/when I have something worth looking at. At first glance it affects several HTML templates (not just base.html) and a few Python files, so it'll be a while.
This would obviously be a breaking change, so should ideally be made configurable; any suggestions as to how to implement that would be welcome. Otherwise it could be queued for a hypothetical 4.0 release of DRF.
