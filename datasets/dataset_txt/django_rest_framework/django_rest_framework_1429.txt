After upgrading DRF from 3.2.5 to 3.3.1 I noticed the api response format changed and no longer represents the format that's shown on the main page.
Api response with DRF 3.2.5 (expected response)
{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        // my object results
    ]
}
Api response with DRF 3.3.1 (only returns list/array)
[
    // my object results
]
There is only 1 object returned in the result set so no additional pages exist. However, this change breaks every api consuming caller since the response format has now changed.
