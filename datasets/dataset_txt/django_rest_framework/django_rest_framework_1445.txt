Hi, I might be doing something wrong, but I cant get the lookup fields to show in the browsable API. I have django-filter and django-crispy-forms installed. Both of them are listed in the INSTALLED_APPS.
That's the viewset:
class EventsViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Event.get_current()
    serializer_class = EventSerializer
    filter_backends = (filters.DjangoFilterBackend,)
    filter_fields = ('venue',)
That's the serializer:
class EventSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Event
The browser shows all the objects perfectly fine, but not the filter input for "venue". Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks ahead.
