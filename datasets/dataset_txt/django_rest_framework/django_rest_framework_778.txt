I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Set up an example project based on DRF tutorial. Set DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES to rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser.
Add the following to urls.py:
from rest_framework.documentation import include_docs_urls
url(r'^docs/', include_docs_urls(title='API Title', description='API description'))
Now start your server and access localhost:8000/docs as an unauthenticated user; you get an AttributeError instead of 403.
Expected behavior
Users should not be able to access docs for restricted views and should see a 403.
Actual behavior
The template (document.html) doesn't check if user is authenticated or not (for restricted views) and tries to render a non-existing document object.
