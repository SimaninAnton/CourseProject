I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing testfix as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
create a serializer with a HiddenField
create a ModelViewSet referencing that serializer
visit the URL corresponding to that ModelViewSet
switch to the Raw Data tab and observe that the initial value of the Content textarea is a JSON instance that contains a key for the HiddenField
Expected behavior
The initial value of the Content textarea is a template JSON instance that contains a key for the HiddenField.
Actual behavior
The initial value of the Content textarea is a template JSON instance that does not contain a key for the HiddenField.
