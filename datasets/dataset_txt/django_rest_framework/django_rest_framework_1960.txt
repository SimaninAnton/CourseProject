I get an KeyError u'max_value' in 3.1.0 if one of the fields in the code below is an IntegerField
FloatFields and CharFields are working without a problem.
The same code (with all types of fields) works in 3.0.5 like a charm.
class ProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Profile
        fields = ('rating', 'rating_votes', 'sub_type', 'sub_expire_date', 'language')
Or did I miss anything?
Yours
