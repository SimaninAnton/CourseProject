I have a model containing FloatField field:
coste = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
and I have built a browsable API for the model using djangorestframework.
In the put form of the browsable API, the coste field is automatically formatted using a comma separator (so 3.0 is shown in the form as 3,0). I guess django or djangorestframework are formatting it according to my system locale.
However, if the form is submitted an error because of the number formatting:
HTTP 400 Bad Request
{
    "coste": [
        "Se requiere un número válido. [means: A valid number is required]"
    ]
}
I am aware that djangorestframework does not support localized decimal fields (according to #2897), but I would expect that it is able to create a non-localized field which correctly works on a localized environment.
