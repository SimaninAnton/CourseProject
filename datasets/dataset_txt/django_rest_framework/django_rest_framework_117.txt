Hello.
It's convenient to be able to run REST from a browsable API using django-rest-framework.
If JSON contains a URL, it will automatically become a hyperlink.
I handle dangerous domains, so I do not want them to be easily hyperlinked.
Please let me know if there is a way to disable the ability to make URLs automatically hyperlinks.
Thank you.
