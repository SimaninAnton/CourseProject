In the browsable API, when I submit a form and it causes a 500 error, the page gets reloaded instead of showing Django's 500 template.
For ajax requests, the 500 response is sent in plain text (https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/debug.py#L74) and in the browsable api, the page is redirected to itself when the response is not in HTML (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/566812ac0b577f79801ec67f86f064cf39ebee01/rest_framework/static/rest_framework/js/ajax-form.js#L65)
It would be great to show the error details somehow.
