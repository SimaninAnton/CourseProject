Sorry this might be a noob question but it seems to me that the referenced line does not really do anything:
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/fields.py
Line 1781 in 89ac0a1
 json.dumps(data, cls=self.encoder) 
I would have expected data = json.dumps(data, cls=self.encoder).
Am I missing something here?
