The docstring of serializers.ModelSerializer.create contain create(**validated_data). docutils states, that there is a strong start-marker because of the two asterisks, without an end-marker. While escaping the asterisks does help, it is better to mark the sample code as such:

This comes into play, when for a Sphinx is used to generate documentation for a project, extracting the help from the docstrings with autodoc_default_flags = ['undoc-members']. In this case methods without docstrings apparently inherit the docstrings from ModelSerializer.create and the **validated_data strong start-marker without a closing marker warning.
