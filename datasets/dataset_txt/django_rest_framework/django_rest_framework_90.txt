I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a generic view set using a pagination class e.g. LimitOffsetPagination
Generate an OpenAPI schema
Expected behavior
The keys that the pagination class wrap the results in appear in the list operation response schema e.g. count, next, previous and results for LimitOffsetPagination
Actual behavior
These properties aren't present. (There doesn't seem to a way for a pagination class to tell AutoSchema about what its responses look like.)
(Additionally, if no pagination class is specified, the response schema should be an array rather than an object.)
