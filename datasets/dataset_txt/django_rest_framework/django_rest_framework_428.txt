I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
The current docstrings for BasicAuthentication say:
class BasicAuthentication(BaseAuthentication):

    def authenticate(self, request):
        """
        Returns a `User` if a correct username and password have been supplied
        using HTTP Basic authentication.  Otherwise returns `None`.
        """
However when trying to use this class to parse Basic Authentication outside DRF I get an exception instead of None (as per the docstring):
user = BasicAuthentication().authenticate(request)
rest_framework.exceptions.AuthenticationFailed:
I guess this is because authenticate() returns self.authenticate_credentials(userid, password, request), which does the following:
if user is None:
            raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed(_('Invalid username/password.'))
