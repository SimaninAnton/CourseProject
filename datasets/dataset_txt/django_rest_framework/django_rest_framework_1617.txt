I have the following model field
    active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
For a POST, when this field is missing, the instance used to be created with active = True (as per the default). The instance is now getting created with active = False.
This is occurring since upgrading from 3.1.3 to 3.2.2.
I have to manually declare the serializer field on the model serializer to get it to default to True.
