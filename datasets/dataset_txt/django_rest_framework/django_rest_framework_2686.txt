If you supply invalid XML data to an XMLParser instance, you'll get an exception within an exception handler. The relevant lines of code in parsers.py are:
except (etree.ParseError, ValueError) as exc:
    raise ParseError('XML parse error - %s' % six.u(exc))
six.u() takes a string as argument, but it's being supplied with an exception instance.
Got a deadline looming, so apologies for just sending in a bug report rather than preparing a patch.
