The documentation for the "default" parameter to Field says:
default
If set, this gives the default value that will be used for the field if none is supplied. If not set the default behavior is to not populate the attribute at all.
This sounds like it would work for Field, but in fact it only works for WriteableField. It would be useful to either make this explicit, or make default work for a Field as well. The behaviour then would be to insert the default value if the source wasn't found in the object being serialized.
