After switching to DRF 3.3.0 from 2.4.4, I am suddenly getting a lot of "must implement all abstract methods" warnings from PyCharm's linter. (They were not there when using 2.4.4.)
They are occurring on every ModelSerializer object we have. The serializers are not particularly complicated: nearly all of them match the example in the serializers documentation:
class AccountSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
class Meta:
model = Account
fields = ('id', 'account_name', 'users', 'created')
I thought that the linter might be triggered by NotImplemented exceptions, but the source code seems to eliminate that theory.
I'm not sure that this adversely affects functionality, but I figured I should ask, because it is a marked change in the analysis of the code.
