in authtoken/models.py the User <-> Token association is a OneToOneField. Is there a specific reason for it not to be a simple ForeignKey?
With sessions, users can have multiple opened sessions. With APIs, people can have multiple devices / apps talking to a service and it'd be preferable for them not to share the same token.
It's very simple to write a custom TokenAuthentication that allows multiple tokens (I need something similar to GitHub's API, with a note / note_url associated to each token) but I'm wondering if it'd not be a saner default to allow multiple tokens per user. I'm happy to write a patch for this, otherwise I'll just roll my own TokenAuthentication.
Opinions?
