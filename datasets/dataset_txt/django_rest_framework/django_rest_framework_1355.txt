MEDIA_URL='//media.xx.com'
Because I both support http and https protocol and I want auto use https prefix Image URL in https website.
In common ViewSet, everything is OK, API output ImageField URL auto add http or https.
But when I override some method, like list, the http prefix lost.
For example:
    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return super(CartViewSet, self).list(request, args, kwargs)
I didn't do anything, why all of ImageField URL's http prefix lost?
