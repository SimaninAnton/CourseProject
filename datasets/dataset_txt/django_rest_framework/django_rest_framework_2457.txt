hello,
there is an issue with the horizontal scrolling of the div.wrapper in the Browsable API. In the file base.html there is the line 217:
<div id="push"></div>
This is an empty div that lays over the horizontal scrollbar and disables scrolling.
I removed this line and set the line 86 in the file bootstrap-tweaks.css from:
margin: 0 auto -60px;
to:
margin: 0 auto 60px;
After this the horizontal scrolling works as expected and there is a decent distance between the wrapper and the footer.
I can't understand the intention of the author and the expected functionality of the above mentioned empty div.
We're using django-rest-framework for few projects here and really like the Browsable API which poures the gravy over the meat. It is kind a "unique selling point" of django-rest-framework and it would be nice if this issue could be corrected in the next version.
Thank you for reading!
