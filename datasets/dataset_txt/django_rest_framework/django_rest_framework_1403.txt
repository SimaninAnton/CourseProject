Regarding read_only_fields in Serializer, I'm far more often concerned which fields I can edit rather which ones I can't. It would often be more intuitive and feel safer to have
fields = (
    # Long list of fields
)
editable_fields = (
  "first_name",
  "last_name"
)
rather than the calculating the intersection of fields and read_only_fields in my head:
fields = (
    # Long list of fields
)
read_only_fields = (
    # Slightly shorter list of fields
)
Now I did this in a subclass by overriding get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs since get_extra_kwargs does not pass in the field_names necessary to change the read_only default on each field.
