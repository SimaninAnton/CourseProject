The auth token is a basic symmetric version of a token, which is a string of 20 random bytes suitable for cryptographic use.
There is also an asymmetric RSA-based version of token handling.
It would be nice to specify this in the documentation, because it has an impact on security. An asymmetric version would be more secure because the users/clients token is not the same as the matching token on the server side.
So far the version of the token is not specified.
