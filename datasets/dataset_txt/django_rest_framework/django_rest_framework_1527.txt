When trying to reset the value of a field, I can use both "" (empty string) as well as null with an IntegerField, but I'm not able to use an empty string with a DecimalField. This is especially weird since the DecimalField is being returned as a string (due to COERCE_DECIMAL_TO_STRING).
I'm not sure if the empty string should be possible with both fields, but at least it should be consistent from my point of view.
