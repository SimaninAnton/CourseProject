Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
The license on the website at https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#license is different to the license in the source code at https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/LICENSE.md
Expected behavior
They be the same.
Actual behavior
It looks like the github version has been updated but not the website. Different copyright holder, and an extra clause in the github sourcecode version.
