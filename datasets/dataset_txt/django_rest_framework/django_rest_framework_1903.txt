A 500 occurs when I try to use this renderer and I do not have permissions to the view
Exception Type: AttributeError
Exception Value: 'dict' object has no attribute 'serializer'
In the render method it looks for the serializer that is normally attached to the data (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/renderers.py#L333), but cannot find it when a permission or nonauthenticated exception is raised.
