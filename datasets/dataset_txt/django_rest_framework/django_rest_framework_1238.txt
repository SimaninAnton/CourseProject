I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Configure sentry
Create an API endpoint with POST as required method.
Raise exception in the implementation.
Hit the endpoint with some POST data.
Check sentry for the raised exception.
Check body of the request.
Expected behavior
It should contain the data that was sent in the request by the user, i.e., the complete POST data.
Actual behavior
It shows there.
This is due to the fact that sentry/raven tries to extract the data from either body or raw_post_data or POST as shown here. In all the cases, its either not implemented or it returns blank dict.
Kindly add support for third-party apps which run on django's implementation model.
