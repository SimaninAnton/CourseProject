Is there any way to remove the django.contrib.auth app if I don't need authentication. The six tables it creates in my database are pretty ugly. Here is my config:
INSTALLED_APPS = (
#    'django.contrib.admin',
#    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
#    'django.contrib.sessions',
#    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'rest_framework',
    'core'
)

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
#    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
#    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
#    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
#    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
)

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES' : [],
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES' : [],
    'PAGINATE_BY': 1000
}
I get deprecation warnings:
(env)... $ ./manage.py runserver
