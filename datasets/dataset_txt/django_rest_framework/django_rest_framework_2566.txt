According to http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/format-suffixes the suffices should be used directly after the resource name like http://example.com/api/users.json but format_suffix_patterns applies them after the trailing slash if one is used in the urlpatterns it gets (like the DefaultRouter does)
This results in 404 when trying to use them in the tutorial app for example: http://restframework.herokuapp.com/users.json
