Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Have enough DRF API endpoints / a small enough window so that the endpoints in the navbar reach to the bottom of the window.
Expected behavior
The Authentication and source code selection buttons appear below all endpoints. Endpoint list could be scrollable?
Actual behavior
The Authentication and Source Code language selection buttons on the bottom left of the interactive API docs overlap with endpoints in the navigation bar on the left when there are enough endpoints.
When you uncollapse an endpoint close to these buttons it opens under these buttons.
