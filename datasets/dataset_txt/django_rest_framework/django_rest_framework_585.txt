Expected behavior
I belive the APIClient would be more user friendly if the .credentials() method was called .headers() or something similar.
Calling the method .credentials() when it sets headers can be confusing. For example, I wanted to add a HTTP_ACCEPT header to the request, and did not realise credentials() would allow that. I assumed it would just be for auth-related setup.
Actual behavior
.credentials() can also be used to set non-auth related headers.
Thanks!
