I open this ticket to check whether it's worth working on a specific case I spotted recently.
It is not possible to use built-in methods (or functions) in fields "source" argument, as they are not treated as simple_callable.
Steps to reproduce
Example with Django User's date joined:
# serializers.py
day_joined = serializer.ReadOnlyField(source=`date_joined.date`)
Result
{
    "day_joined": "<built-in method date of datetime.datetime object at 0x109400000>"
}
Expected result
{
    "day_joined": "2008-09-03"
}
Suggestion
There are ways to ensure a built-in method/callable is a simple callable (ie can be called without arguments as per rest_framework.fields.is_simple_callable).
I'm happy to create the PR for this, but need to know if it's worth it beforehand.
