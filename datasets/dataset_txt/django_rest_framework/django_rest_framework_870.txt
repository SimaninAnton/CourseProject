I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Intall pytz (along with Django and django-rest-framwork);
Set settings.TIME_ZONE = 'America/New_York';
Make a serializor with DateTimeField;
Try to serialize '2017-03-12T02:30:00'.
or
Execute DateTimeField(default_timezone=pytz.timezone('America/New_York')).to_internal_value('2017-03-12T02:30:00')
Expected behavior
ValidationError raised with appropriate message.
Actual behavior
NonExistentTimeError/AmbiguousTimeError propagated from pytz.
