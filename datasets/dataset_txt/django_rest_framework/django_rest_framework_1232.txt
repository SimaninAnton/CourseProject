I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add a PostgreSQL RangeField to your model.
Use the drf-extra-fields library to create a serializer for that field.
POST an unbounded RangeField object.
Expected behavior
Should return 201 Created
Actual behavior
Returns 400 BAD REQUEST - This field may not be null

I'm not sure if submitting a bug using third-party libraries is legit, but after checking with them they say the problem is not with them. So submitting here in hopes i can get to the answer.
