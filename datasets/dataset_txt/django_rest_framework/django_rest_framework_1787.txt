this is my project
this is code for django-rest-framework
router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'testpapers', TestPaperViewSet)
router.register(r'questions', QuestionViewSet)
router.register(r'questionTypes', QuestionTypeViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
]
if the code is in cet4.urls will have error
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "question-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the lookup_field attribute on this field.
if the code is in yundong.urls it is correct ã€‚
Any ideas?
Thanks
