Hi,
I have model that looks more or less like this:
class Package(models.Model):
    id = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=64)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    products = models.ManyToManyField(Product, related_name='products')
When doing PUT operation and changing the ID, it seems that it creates new data (with that ID), instead of updating the ID itself (the new data also has empty products even if I specify the products). It's returning 200 though instead of 201. Is this the expected behaviour? I am using version 3.1.3 .
The data that I send looks like this:
        new_data = {
            'id': new_id,
            'name': 'An Awesome Package',
            'products': [product_id]
        }
        response = self.client.put(url, new_data)
Thanks
