tl;dr I'd love to support DRF with a one-off donation.
Currently the project only accepts donations via subscription.
If an individual user wants to donate a specific amount, they need to:
start a monthly subscription and then remember to cancel after n months once they've met their intended donation amount for the year
donate $15/month indefinitely
Could DRF allow one-off donations as well, like Django?
