Looks like this issue exist since long time as there is no solution for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21047384/reverse-url-by-more-than-one-parameter-in-django-rest-framework since one year.
I though to create the issue here.
Let's take the usual Customers with Orders pair of models.
How can we make a HyperlinkedModelSerializer of Order url field reverse to a url like
/customers/<customer_pk>/orders/<order_id>/?
I thought of using the lookup_field in the Meta class but it seems to only accept one field.
Thanks for your help
