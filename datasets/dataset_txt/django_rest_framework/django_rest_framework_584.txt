I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Attempt to retrieve an access token for a user with is_active is false.
Expected behavior
The message returned by the serialiser should indicate the user account has been disabled or is inactive
Actual behavior
'Unable to log in with provided credentials.'
I'm using this is_active flag to check for whether or not the user has confirmed his email. As I have seen in the code for the serializer, there is a note about this for Django 1.10+. This happens because the authenticate function returns None when is_active is False. I would expect the authenticate method to return the user object even if is_active is set to False as further checking can be performed manually.
Arguably this is an issue with Django 1.10+ but the issue could be fixed using the proxy function of DRF
