Specific issue: PaginatorMixin.url_with_page_number throws away any query parameters that already exist when generating the link to the next or previous page. So, for example, any ordering or filtering parameters will be lost.
More general issue, which may also be relevant to #106: URLs should probably be parsed and generated using tools that understand their structure, rather than by naive string concatenation/substitution.
I'm happy to put some work into a patch, but I'm not sure what the best approach would be. My go-to solution would be to use urlobject, but that depends on your feelings towards external dependencies. It would also be possible to do it manually with urllib/urlparse/cgi.parse_qsl.
