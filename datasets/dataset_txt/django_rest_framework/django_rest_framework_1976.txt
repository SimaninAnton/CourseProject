We discussed this previously in matthewwithanm/django-imagekit#289, but it came up on another project so I figured I'd open an issue.
It would be really awesome if DRF allowed fields to define their own default serializer using a simple interface. (I figure it would work something like formfield.) This would allow authors of custom fields to bundle serializers for DRF that support common usages and don't rely on how the object is str'd.
Thanks!
