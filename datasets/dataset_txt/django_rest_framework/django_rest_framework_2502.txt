Currently I am using:
    permission_classes = (DjangoReadObjectPermissions, )
    filter_backends = (filters.DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter,)
on my ModelViewSet to limit access (per: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering#djangoobjectpermissionsfilter). The problem is that on the browseable API, the drop down list for a PrimaryKeyRelatedField still shows all of the possible options. Is there an easy way to filter the set of choices used based on the user, etc?
These do not seem to work:
