There are several places on this page that talk about "UserThrottle":
http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling.html
Looking at master tip (0eec692) in git, I see this:
./docs/api-guide/throttling.md:
   47 :         throttle_classes = (UserThrottle,)
   58 :     @throttle_classes(UserThrottle)
   86 : The `UserThrottle` will throttle users to a given rate of requests 
across the API.  The user id is used to generate a unique key to throttle 
against.  Unauthenticated requests will fall back to using the IP address 
of the incoming request to generate a unique key to throttle against.
   90 : * The `rate` property on the class, which may be provided by 
overriding `UserThrottle` and setting the property.
  116 : `UserThrottle` is suitable if you want simple global rate restrictions 
per-user.
If my theory that "UserThrottle" should be "UserRateThrottle" is correct, I'm happy to provide a pull request.
If not, then where's UserThrottle defined?
