RFC 7231 defines the safe HTTP methods as:
GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE
The SAFE_METHODS constant in the django-rest-framework permissions module is currently:
SAFE_METHODS = ('GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS')
As a point of comparison, Django's CSRF middleware includes TRACE in its list of safe methods.
Is there a reason it wasn't included, or should I open a PR to add it?
Many thanks :-)
