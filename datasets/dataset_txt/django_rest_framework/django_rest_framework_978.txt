After doing some digging in the rest framework source, it looks like whenever a python property that is implemented as a data descriptor, such as using @property is discovered in a set of fields, a ReadOnlyField is always generated.
Why is it the case that we are generating read only fields by default, when a descriptor could have a valid __set__ defined?
I understand that a common case is just using @property and not defining a setter, and by doing so __set__ raises an AttributeError. Would it be too messy to try to determine if a valid setter has been defined and if so make the field writable as opposed to read only?
