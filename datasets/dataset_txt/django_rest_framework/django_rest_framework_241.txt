Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Open https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/
Search for filter_fields.
Expected behavior
Nothing found.
Actual behavior
No nothing found :)
More info
filter_fields is deprecated in favor of filterset_fields. At least the following file is to be updated. It probably makes sense to change get_filter_fields method name as well.
