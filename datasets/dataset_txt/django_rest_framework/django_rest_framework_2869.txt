hi,
I have a view of type DestroyAPIView.
Is it the expected behaviour that the serializer does not get rendered as a form when visiting the browsable API page?
i.e. I do not see the the tabs "HTML Form" and "Raw data" where i see them on other types of views like UpdateAPIView or CreateAPIView.
If it isn't, I am happy to submit a patch for it, but don't know where to look.
