Currently, the only option for providing clients context about throttle limits via the API requires them to reach their throttle limit, and inspect the X-Throttle-Wait-Seconds header if it was set when raising the Throttled exception with a wait argument.
Only option that seems possible right now would require a middleware class to inspect for a 429 response and add the headers, but that moves the logic outside the scope of the Throttle classes, and would lose some possibly useful context info about why it was throttled.
One possible solution would be to accept an optional headers argument in the Throttled exception, allowing any custom response headers to be explicitly set in the Throttle classes. Better still would be allowing Throttle classes to operate like middleware, and optionally always provide X-RateLimit headers similar to the Github or Twitter APIs.
