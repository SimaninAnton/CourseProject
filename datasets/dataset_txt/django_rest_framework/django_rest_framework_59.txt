In very short, when an API endpoint is requested from some frontend that happens to include header such as Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 (which is the case of firefox 48 for example), then the DRF endpoint answers by HTML instead of JSON. This Accept header is ignored when Debug=False, but this happens when set to True)
I am not sure it's actually an issue or is it intended behavior. One thing for sure is that it breaks everything during the time you forgot to set debug to False again. I don't see a reason why it should take this Accept header into account anyway. What do you think?
