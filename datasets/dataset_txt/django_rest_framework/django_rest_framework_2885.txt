Problem:
For ManyToManyFields with attribute "through", the object fails to save because the rest framework is trying to save this m2m field. However, these special m2m fields that have attribute "through" cannot be saved directly and must use an object manager to do so.
My proposed solution (you might have better and cleaner ideas):
In my code, I ignore m2m fields that have a through attribute during saves by doing this in seralizers.save_object():
    if getattr(self, 'm2m_data', None):
        for accessor_name, object_list in self.m2m_data.items():
            through_auto = getattr(getattr(getattr(getattr(self.object, accessor_name), 'through'), '_meta'), 'auto_created')
            if through_auto:
                setattr(self.object, accessor_name, object_list)
        self.m2m_data = {}
