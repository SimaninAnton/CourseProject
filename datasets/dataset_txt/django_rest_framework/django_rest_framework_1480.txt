If you have a BooleanField on the modelSerializer, where on the model the BooleanField is defined as:
models.BooleanField(blank=True, default=None)
The modelSerializer still parses it as False instead of None. This is different from the ModelForm (which leaves it empty, so you can set it in the save method or anywhere else), and therefore unexpected.
It is the same as the modelForm. But still... I think that when you submit JSON, omitting the booleanfield alltogether, it should be null (as in unset), because I have literally specified blank=True, meaning that it should have required = False...
