I'm not sure whether this is a bug, an issue in the tutorial, or an issue in documentation. I'm willing to provide a fix, once I know what is needed.
Steps to reproduce
Follow instructions in step 1 in tutorial to the end.
Add the argument label to the Snippet model's field linenos in https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorial/1-serialization.md#creating-a-model-to-work-with
linenos = models.BooleanField(default=False, label='Line Numbers')
Run the app.
Expected behavior
I expected the field to display a label in accordance with the documentation of field arguments.
Actual behavior
Internal Server Error. I had to remove the argument from my code, and restart the server to restore functionality.
