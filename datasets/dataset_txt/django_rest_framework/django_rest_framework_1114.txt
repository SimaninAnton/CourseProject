If we want to be consistent with the semantics of Model, I believe we need to remove null from the exclusion criteria here:
blank applies to inputs, indicating whether or not their optional
null applies to databases, indicating how a blank value is stored (empty string vs. true database NULL)
Since required is an input rule, blank (and default) but not null are the appropriate flags to consider.
