In my project I have found an issue with DRF.
Suppose we have the model and serializer with:
class SomeModel:
    zip = CharField(max_length=100, null=False, blank=True, default="")


class SomeSerializer(ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
         model = SomeModel
This serializer will allow to put data like {'zip': None} and it will be valid (it's ok and fine),
but when we try to save serializer object with that dataset, we will receive
Column 'zip' cannot be null
ModelSerializer for CharField doesn't use default value of model field and causes warning error.
