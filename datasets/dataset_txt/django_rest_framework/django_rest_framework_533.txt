I have been working with the new Angular, written in Typescript.
On large projects, the workflow (and I believe best practice) is following:
there is a change in the API
swagger file is generated
Typescript interfaces and Angular services communicating with the API are auto-generated (e.g. with this or this).
In order do it, you need to have a definition of response schema. To the best of my knowledge, the Core API does not currently support that.
This is a major DRF issue that has been reported over a year ago in issue #4502. It seems there is still no Core API fix in sight.
In my opinion, the auto-documenting mechanism is currently the biggest DRF's pain point.
The situation seemed hopeless until some good soul created drf-yasg. To me, this is the best documenting solution in town.
I wasted too much time on this issue and I believe there will be others following my path. Hence, the documentation should include:
clear statement that the current Core API solution does not support auto-generated response schemas.
there is drf-yasg that does have this capability
