This issue related to DRF 2x.
Here we have call of full_clean method of a model, which assigns non-field-errors to __all__ key, and here - we have internal ModelSerializer's validation, which assign such errors to non_field_errors field.
I think, in both cases non-field-errors must be assigned to same key.
