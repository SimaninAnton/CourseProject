Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
When I add (POST/create) a new instance via an ModelViewSet, the "get_object" method is not called, and hence the self.check_object_permissions and thus user.has_perm('app_label'.add_'perm', obj="object_to_be_created") is not called.
Expected behavior
However, if I look here: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#djangoobjectpermissionsfilter and http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#djangoobjectpermissions it might confuse people, and raise the expectation that also for "add" the permissions are checked when those permission and filter backends are included.
Actual behavior
To be honoust, I'm not yet sure what the cleanest way to check the permissions on POSTing is. However, for me it would be perfectly fine if user.has_perm('app_label'.add_'perm', obj='new_object') would be called (with new object of course without an id).
