Steps to reproduce
I have subclassed Token Auth as recommended to use the keyword "Bearer".
I also use facebook authentication which uses the same keyword "Bearer" (through djang-rest-framework-social-auth).
Both are listed in default Auth Classes, however, only the first listed class is checked.
Expected behavior
I would expect the auth progression to continue checking no matter what they keyword is.
Actual behavior
Progression stops at first auth class using that keyword. When using different keywords (such as Token and Bearer), it completes all checks.
