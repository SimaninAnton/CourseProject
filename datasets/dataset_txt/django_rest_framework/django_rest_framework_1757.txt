Would be nice to have a setting to customise which serializer field type is used by default for a given model field type.
e.g. I’m using Djangae which has a custom ListField type, which I’d like to always use DRF’s ListField by default. I can do it like this:
from rest_framework import serializers

serializers.ModelSerializer._field_mapping[djangae.fields.ListField] = serializers.ListField
but then I need to put that somewhere where it’ll always be imported. Kinda feels a bit like a bit of a monkeypatch.
Would be awesome if I could do this in settings.py:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'CUSTOM_MODEL_FIELD_MAPPINGS': {
        'djangae.fields.ListField': 'rest_framework.fields.ListField',
    }
}
