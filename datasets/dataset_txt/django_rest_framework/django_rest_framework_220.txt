Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Description
This link on Browser enhancements page is broken:
broken link: https://github.com/encode/ajax-form
page: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/browser-enhancements/
The repository linked seems to be dead, has this been integrated into DRF? I think this needs to be updated with the correct link, or removed if no link exists.
