Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a ViewSet and overwrite dispatch method and try to access one of self.request, self.args or self.kwargs before calling super
Expected behavior
It should return the appropriate objects
Actual behavior
It raises AttributeError
This should be related to this Django ticket https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/19316 which was fixed before 5 years in Django 1.6 and backported to Django 1.5.
The solution is to set these in the decorator generated in as_view method as Django does (django/django@ea6b95d)
I can try to prepare a PR
