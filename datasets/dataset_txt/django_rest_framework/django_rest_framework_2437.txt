Currently the documentation is built using the mkdocs.py script in the repo.
This is pretty hacky. It's awkward to add new sections and easy to miss something when you do add a new section. We should move to using MkDocs, for the documentation, as be a better supported, cleaner version of the current script.
Using MkDocs will also allow us to use richer interlinking, once it properly supports nicer topic links, and will make it easier for us to notice when links are broken or missing etc...
We could either use the MkDocs default theme, or stick with the existing style, as a custom MkDocs theme.
To do (for anyone): Build the current docs with MkDocs, figure out what features we're still missing, which parts of the docs will need work etc...
