Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Upgrade to 3.4.3 from 3.3.3. The app I tested this with is essentially identical to the tutorial.
I ran makemigrations, migrate, and runserver to ensure django was not aware of any potential issues.
Expected behavior
Standard features you'd expect from the tutorial.
Actual behavior
No POST forms are loading (to post snippets in the context of the tutorial). In addition, most interaction is not functional. I cannot logout or press the GET button. I am obviously not particularly interested in getting the tutorial to work. I'm concerned that when I upgrade my own app it will have the same problems in terms of the browsable api being essentially non-functional. However, I can't seem to find anyone else that is experiencing similar issues.
