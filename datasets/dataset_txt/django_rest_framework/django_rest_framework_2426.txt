Hi
Following code is the part of Field class from fields.py
def field_to_native(self, obj, field_name):
.......
for component in source.split('.'):
value = get_component(value, component)
if value is None:
break
return self.to_native(value)
I think if the value is None then we have to return None instead of breaking the loop and giving the None as a parameter to self.to_native method I was getting exception due to this because i am using ImageField in serializers.Serializer class where this field is not mandatory in this case when i submit the form the Imagefield has a None value and the above code generating exception i have changed the code line "break" to "return None" and it is working fine.
And the other side it is not logical unless you have place a None check in to_native method of every class.
