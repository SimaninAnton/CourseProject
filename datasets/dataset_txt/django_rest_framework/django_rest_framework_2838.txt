I'm trying to extend say CreateModelMixin and got hit by the fact that it's not really extendable.
For example, I whish I could do something like:
class ExtjsCreateModelMixin(CreateModelMixin):
    def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        result = super(ExtjsCreateModelMixin, self).create(request, *args, **kwargs)
        result[0] = {'data': result[0]}
        return result
