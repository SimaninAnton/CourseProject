If you pass data of a wrong type to a Serializer, you can get bad validation behavior, such as incorrectly validating as True (which will of course cause problems when you call save() later) or simply raising an error instead of returning False. I wrote a test case to show what I mean: bc79eba. The problem with this is that a user can cause a server error by sending e.g. a json serialized integer to an update view.
Do you agree that that test case should pass? If so, I'll work on fixing the issue because I need it for my project.
