When I am looking at this documentation: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/, I have no idea on how to import RequestsClient.
I tried many methods, all failed. Any idea on how to make it work?
>>> from rest_framework.test import RequestsClient
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name RequestsClient
