In TokenAuthentication I believe that in authenticate() the result of authenticate_header() should be used when checking the first part of the authorization header. Currently the code just checks on token:
if not auth or auth[0].lower() != b'token':
    return None
When you override the TokenAuthentication to use another authenticate header, it will not work anymore.
