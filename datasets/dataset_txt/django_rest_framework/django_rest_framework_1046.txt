Currently, these separate actions on the viewset inherit the schema from the viewset, but that's very often not correct. Even if it's not used to present data (which, btw, should also be an option, but that's a discussion for another time :P), you should be able to annotate the view somehow so that the schema generator can generate the correct schema. Right now, you're stuck doing ugly things in get_serializer(), but it can be standardized!
