I fall on a strange error during my development.
The root cause was that I specified a field that didn't exist on the model.
The message was: "Serializer related fields must include a queryset argument or set `read_only=True"
As to me, it's because the except located here (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/relations.py#L74) is too generic to get the real root cause.
I'll write a test case to illustrate the issue and will try to narrow the exception to catch.
