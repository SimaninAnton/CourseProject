Attempting to construct a multipart/form-data request from the "Raw data" panel within the browseable API returns a 400. This is because django's MultiPartParser is never passed a value for the request's multi-part boundary. The error message is: "Multipart form parse error - Invalid boundary in multipart: None"
Would it make sense to have a default boundary?
