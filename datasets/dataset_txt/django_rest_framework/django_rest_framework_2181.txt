I propose to add the request (or some request context object) to the exception handler method signature.
exception_handler(exc) to exception_handler(request, exc)
This would cover a legitimate use case wherein the user needs contextual information to determine how to handle the error. For instance, the user might want to silently ignore harmless errors (say, requests that have 'WhiteHat Security' in the HTTP_USER_AGENT), whereas for all other requests the user would want to track the exception via analytics tools and/or bug tracking applications.
