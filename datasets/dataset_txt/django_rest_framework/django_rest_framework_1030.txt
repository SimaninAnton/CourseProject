Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add 'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter' to 'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS' in settings.
Create a filter that calls the context:
class MySerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):

  def get_fields(self, *args, **kwargs):

        fields  = super(MySerializer, self).get_fields(*args, **kwargs)
        request = self.context['request']

        return fields
This will raise a KeyError on 'request'.
Patch
I've fixed it, I'll send a pull request ASAP.
