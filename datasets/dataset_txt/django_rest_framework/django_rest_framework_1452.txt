Hi
The FileUploadParser code (line 181) in rest_framework.parsers.py seems to work differently as it should be.
The line does not work in my Python 2.7.8 (OSX El Capitan):
if file_obj:
I modified and works like this:
if file_obj is not None:
Could someone confirm this buggy behavior under other situations?
Thanks.
Regards,
Yu
