This is my use case:
EmberData needs 422 for ValidationErrors
But DRF is replying with 400
I would (api/my_exceptions.py):
from rest_framework import serializers

class EmberDataValidationError(serializers.ValidationError):
    status_code = 422
But at this point I am unable to tell drf to use my EmberDataValidationError. Is this configurable, or is there another way of achieving a similar effect?
Or is this maybe an extra configuration parameter that could be added to DRF?
