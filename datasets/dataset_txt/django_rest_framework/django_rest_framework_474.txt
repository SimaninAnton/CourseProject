I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
DateTimeField
...
def to_representation(self, value):
    if not value:
        return None

    output_format = getattr(self, 'format', api_settings.DATETIME_FORMAT)

    if output_format is None or isinstance(value, six.string_types):
        return value

    if output_format.lower() == ISO_8601:
        value = self.enforce_timezone(value)
        value = value.isoformat()
        if value.endswith('+00:00'):
            value = value[:-6] + 'Z'
        return value
    return value.strftime(output_format)
Expected behavior
Actual behavior
Timezone does not set (self.enforce_timezone(value)) for non ISO_8601 formatsd
