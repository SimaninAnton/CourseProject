The fix for #380 only fixed null values when generating JSON from existing data (GET).
Saving data (POST/PUT) is still broken in a different way. The from_native method assumes the value is a string, and calls startswith() on it, which obviously fails.
I wrote a test for it, and will submit it along with a proposed fix, but it seems that there is an issue with the way the data is handled using the RequestFactory, the way the other tests are written. When None is passed for a value within data, it gets translated to u'None'. I ended up using self.client.put instead, which is what I use in my own tests, and reflects the behaviour I've seen from actual browsers.
