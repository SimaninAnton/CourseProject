I haven't seen a note in the release notes that this requires updating, so I assume it's a bug? Feel free to close/lay smackdown if I am off. :)
The serializer:
class TheSerializer(AllayUserSerializer):
        model = TheModel
        fields = ('a_foreign_key', )
The Model:
class TheModel(models.Model):
       a_foreign_key = models.ForeignKey(SomeOtherModel, null=True, blank=True)
When trying to serialize, I get the following exception
TypeError: <...> is not JSON serializable
In old releases, the system automatically serialized the primary key as a string in the response, with the latest version it is returning the object.
