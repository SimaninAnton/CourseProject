Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
See code in stackoverflow question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49913996/django-not-recognizing-field-override-for-current-user-in-serializer
The usage for this serializer field is outlined on the website:
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#specifying-read-only-fields
I am only able to get it to work by not making it readonly:
creator = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=User.objects.all(), default=serializers.CreateOnlyDefault(serializers.CurrentUserDefault()))
Expected behavior
I expect with that code that the current user should be retrieved and I should not get a NOT NULL constraint error.
Actual behavior
I get a NOT NULL constraint error.
