I've got a field in my serializer marked as read_only. When I try to submit a change for that field using a PATCH request, I get the correct behaviorâ€”the field on the model is not updated. However, I get a 200 response, and not an expected 400 BAD REQUEST. If the field is read only, trying to set it via PUT/PATCH should result in a 400.
