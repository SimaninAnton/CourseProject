This is what the List view end point looks like. Notice the title of the page List and the structure of the content: List:
This is what the List view end point looks like after POSTing a new item. Notice the title of the page List and the structure of the content: an item (only the newly created item):

I personally find this confusing. Also, it is not readily clear to the user how to get from this page back to the normal List view of all items. Both pages share a URL and attempting to refresh in the browser will lead to a warning about rePOSTing data.
