Steps to reproduce
Use authtoken.views.ObtainAuthToken() with a non-existent username.
Expected behavior
I would expect to get a response (say, with code 404, or 400) with or without a message indicating what the problemis.
Actual behavior
An exception is thrown.
While I realize this behavior is by design, it seems a bit wacky if we take a step back and think about it from a typical user perspective. Let's say I have a login page on my website. When a user forgets his username, or alternatively, if someone is trying to guess a username, I need to give some kind of intelligible response either way. So in my view I'm going to have to catch the exception and return some other response in any case. Why make people go through that extra step, instead of returning by default a response that makes sense and will be useful to some people? And while we're at it, the 400 response code when the authentication is unsuccessful doesn't make a great deal of sense, either. Why not 401 -- UNAUTHORIZED!? In my mind, 401 is the perfect fit
