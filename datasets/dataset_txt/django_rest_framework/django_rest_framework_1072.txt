I want SessionAuthentication to return 401 instead of 403 for unauthenticated users, but default SessionAuthentication doesn't support 401, cause there's no authenticate_header() method for it. Is this a totally bad design decision to use 401 with SessionAuthentication? If it's not, should I just create a custom SessionAuthentication subclass, which inherits from default and specifies authenticate_header()?
Andrew (@awbacker):
I get a 401 but I am using JWT and SessionAuthentication. Removing JWT gives a 403 like you say. That is unexpected
