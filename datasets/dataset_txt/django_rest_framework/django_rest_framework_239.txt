Checklist
[*] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[*] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[*] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[*] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[*] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
The function "rest_framework.schemas.inspectors.field_to_schema" does not allow to create schemas for custom serializers. I think that it is more correct to bring this functionality to the serializer itself, by analogy with "FilterBackend.get_schema_fields". If you agree with this, then I could send you a request.
