When using django's get_object_or_404 in a class-based view that abstracts from APIView the default output of get_object_or_404 gets hijacked by DRF. What I would like to see is the default django ouptut that tells me which url failed and why, but what I end up with is:
{"detail":"Not found."}
IMO, this is really invasive behavior and DRF's 404 output should only be returned if the developer explicitly uses status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND as a value for the status parameter in a Response. I could possibly understand this behavior if I was abstracting from GenericAPIView, the class meant for more plugging and playing, but I am not.
Is this something that could be addressed?
