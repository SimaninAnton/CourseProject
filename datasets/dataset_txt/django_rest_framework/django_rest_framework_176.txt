Hey, I experienced some unexpected behavior and from everything I could research it's not a usage problem ... crossing fingers :)
PR for the Unit Test is #6564
I guess the Test explains the Issue, right? But, reading here ViewSet actions you're supposed to pass a ModelSerializer a QuerySet, right?
If I do this, as in the Unit test, Serialization fails. For a single object instance you could make Serialization work again if you'd pass instance.dict - but I guess that's not intended, right?
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[F] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
run the test

So, Tom Christie answers to this already in the PR, I guess this can be kept closed then.
