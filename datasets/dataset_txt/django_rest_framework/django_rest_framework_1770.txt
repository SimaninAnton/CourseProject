I'm following #1964
by declaring something like queryset = SomeObj.objects.all().prefetch_related('many_object') in Generic Viewset
However this also cache when I patch the object and adding or removing that many_object
so I have to override patch method to called get_object() to refresh in order to get the updated return result
...
instance = self.get_object()
return Response(self.get_serializer(instance).data)
Are there any method to separate this?
