From drf 3.0 serializers.DecimalField requires the max_digits and decimal_places arguments. However, when using a ModelSerializer those values are generally specified on the model.
Ideally I'd prefer it if those arguments were optional, and that the values specified on the model field were used as default, but since there's probable a good reason for making them required (less difference between model and non-model serializers perhaps?) I think it at least needs documenting. How do I for instance set coerce_to_string=False without having to specify max_digits and decimal_places on the model field as well as the model serializer field?
