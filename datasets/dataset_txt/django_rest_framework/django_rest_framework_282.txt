Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Put your DRF implementation behind a proxy server such as nginx on a custom port (in my case 8080).
Expected behavior
The API call should succeed and retrieve a list of the next or previous page of results.
Actual behavior
When next and previous links are produced and used, they generate a CORS error since the API url has dropped the port number.
