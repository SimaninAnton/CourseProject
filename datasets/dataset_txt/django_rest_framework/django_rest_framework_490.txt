Hi,
I'm using Django 2.0.1 and when I scaffold my projects with it, it generates a urls.py file containing
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
I saw that the documentation on the site uses the url() function instead of the path() function, for example:
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^', include('broker.urls')),
    url(r'^api-auth', include('rest_framework.urls')),
]
Now, I tried to modify this code slightly so I could use the django.urls.path() function again, but it seems that that doesn't work. Did I do something wrong, or is django.urls.path() just not supported in the Django REST Framework? If not, is it going to be? I prefer path() because it's slightly simpler to write the path strings, and it doesn't require understanding of regex strings.
Kind regards.
