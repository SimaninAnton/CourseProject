Hi,
I got this enpoint /api/events//
When I attempt to PATCH it tries to behave like PUT-as-create but it has no data to create a new instance. I'm wondering if this is correct cause I would have expected an HTTP 404 error.
A soultion may be to check for partial in the update method when object is None and re-raise Http404 exception.
def update(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        partial = kwargs.pop('partial', False)
        self.object = self.get_object_or_none()

        if self.object is None:
            if partial:
                raise Http404

            ...
Do you think this is the correct behavior? Or I'm missing something?
