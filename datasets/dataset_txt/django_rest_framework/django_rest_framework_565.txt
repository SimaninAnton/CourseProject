Ref #5630
The logic to add/adjust manual_fields is currently inline in get_link:
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/schemas/inspectors.py
Lines 184 to 188 in c63e35c
 if self._manual_fields is not None: 
     by_name = {f.name: f for f in fields} 
     for f in self._manual_fields: 
         by_name[f.name] = f 
     fields = list(by_name.values()) 
This should be extracted to a separate method so the logic can be re-used when users are overriding get_link
