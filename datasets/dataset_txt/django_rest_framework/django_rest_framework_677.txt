Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Visit http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/responses/#data
Expected behavior
The description of .data should be accurate
Actual behavior
The attribute .data is described as the unrendered content of a Request object when it's referred above as the serialized content of the response.
