As per OpenAPI Spec, the response object must have a description property.
Steps to reproduce
Generate a schema with manage.py generateschema and paste it into https://editor.swagger.org/
Expected behavior
There should be no error message
Actual behavior
We get an error message
Structural error at paths.[path].get.responses.200
should have required property 'description'
missingProperty: description'
Note: The description should be added in schemas.openapi.AutoSchema._get_responses(), however I'm not sure what to put in there. An empty string does satisfy editor.swagger.io, but of course doesn't help much.
Should we put the serializer's docstring into the description? Would that make sense?
