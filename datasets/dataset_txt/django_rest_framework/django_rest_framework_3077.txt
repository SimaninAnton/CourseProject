In the serializer.py Serializer class, there's some useful code in a method called get_related_serializer that seemingly encourages one to set elements of the fields list/tuple to tuples, allowing one to specify custom serializers for individual fields. If that sentence seems a bit confusing, please take a look at the method. It's pretty well-documented and seems really useful.
The problem is that I don't see any execution path that will ever hit that code. If I ever set anything in fields to a tuple, ie:
fields = [('example', CustomSerializer),]
I'll get a TypeError on line 226 (version 0.3.3) in the method serialize_model:
meth = getattr(self, fname, None)
This line basically requires every element of the field list to be a string.
This seems a bit schizophrenic. The ability to use custom serializers on a field-by-field basis is rather valuable, and the serialize_model code should permit it.
