I prefer to keep domain logic out of my views and models. So, I tend do it in my serializers, often delegating to a "service module", as recommended by this popular SO answser: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12857584/1807888
DRF's CBV mixins all call serializer methods to modify the model layer, except for the DestroyModelMixin, which directly calls the model instance method.
For consistency, it would be nice if this mixin also delegated to the serializer, where I could override as necessary in order to inject my domain-specific logic.
