In am using a django form as a way to filter my list response (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27782251/django-rest-framework-serializer-as-a-form-in-get-deprecated ).
Beside the question whether this is the proper way (which I already suspect, it's not) i runned in to this when putthing the django from data in the serializer:
the django form returns 'on' in case the boolean field is selected,
so in the boolean field, this list should be extended with the 'on','ON' and 'On':
TRUE_VALUES = set(('t', 'T', 'true', 'True', 'TRUE', '1', 1, True,'On','on','ON'))
