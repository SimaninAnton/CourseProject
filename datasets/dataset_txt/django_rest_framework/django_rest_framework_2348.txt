It looks like RoR has a pretty nice approach to building up the router/URLs: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
I like the compact representation to wire up a set of REST endpoints.
I especially like the ability to have a "shallow" representation generated: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#shallow-nesting
Does this sort of feature make sense in DRF? Right now I feel that I am very much Repeating Myself in my urls module.
