(python==2.7.3, django==1.5.1)
As I followed the docs here ... http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication.html#setting-the-authentication-scheme
... when I came to the section that instructed using a tuple for the authentication_classes decorator, I used the format shown in the doc:
@authentication_classes((SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication))
However, whenever I use anything other than a list for that decorator, I get the following iteration error.
'type' object is not iterable
Error/typo in the docs? I noticed this page infers that decorators use the (assuming) correct list rather than a tuple.
