Strictly speaking, a PUT should not do partial updates of a resource.
For instance, if you only PUT some fields, this implies that all other fields are null (or perhaps the db default, but I would say null).
The current behaviour of the UpdateModelMixin is to update whatever fields are passed in on the model, and leave everything else as-is.
This is more appropriate for a POST onto the resource.
