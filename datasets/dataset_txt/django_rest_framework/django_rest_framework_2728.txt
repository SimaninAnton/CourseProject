My tables has boolean fields like below.
enabled = models.BooleanField(default=True)
and save it using a serializer in a view class without passing the enabled field in the request.
serializer = SomeSerializer(data=request.DATA)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            object = serializer.save()
the result is object.enabled == False.
I've updated the framework to version 2.3.8 then the issue started occurring. Everything works fine in 2.3.7.
Affected versions >= 2.3.8
