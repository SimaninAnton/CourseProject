Steps to reproduce
View https://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/3.3.3 on PyPI.
Expected behavior
Rendered HTML that includes links, headings, and the like.
Actual behavior
Raw reST markup appears in a non-monospace font.
I looked at the setup.py and observed that the project does not actually use the long_description field. I think PyPI is trying to convert the README.md to reST and failing. Since PyPI does not support Markdown (see https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/issues/148/support-markdown-for-readmes), maybe an explicit long_description directing users to the proper documentation would be appropriate.
