The description of a view, as returned by setting VIEW_DESCRIPTION_FUNCTION in order to populate OPTIONS request or display help text in browsable API, is always set to the viewset docstring.
I think for the case of @detail_route or @list_route, it should display the help of the method, not the one of the main viewset.
I already wrote some code to do this on my side, if it seems a reasonable feature to you, I can wrap it up for DRF and submit a PR for that.
