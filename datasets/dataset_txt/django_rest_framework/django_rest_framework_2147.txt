I think we have enough bug fixes against 3.0.2 that I'd by happy to see a release rolled now, and any further tickets with that milestone moved onto 3.0.3.
Release manager is @xordoquy.
Pull request is #2297.
Checklist:
Create pull request for release notes based on the 3.0.2 milestone.
Ensure the pull request increments the version to 3.0.2 in restframework/__init__.py.
Confirm with @tomchristie that release is finalized and ready to go.
Merge the release pull request.
Push the package to PyPI with ./setup.py publish.
Tag the release, with git tag -a 3.0.2 -m 'version 3.0.2'; git push --tags.
Deploy the documentation with mkdocs gh-deploy.
Make a release announcement on the discussion group.
Make a release announcement on twitter.
Close the milestone on GitHub.
