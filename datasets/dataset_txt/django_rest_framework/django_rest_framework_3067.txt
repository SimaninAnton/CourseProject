I've included the login view (as part of another urls.py include at "/api/") as described on the django-rest-framework site:
url(r'^restframework', include('djangorestframework.urls', namespace='djangorestframework')),
However, I have tried all of these URLs:
/api/restframework/accounts/login/
/restframework/accounts/login/
/api/accounts/login/
/accounts/login/
/api/login/
/login/
and they all give me 404s ... even the first one, despite the fact that the debug page shows:
 ^api/ ^restframework ^accounts/login/$ 
being one of the valid URL patterns.
So, my question is, what is the proper URL for the login/logout views? I tried looking through all the documentation, issues, and google group messages, but I couldn't find anywhere that mentioned it; even the curl example just says something like "/your-api" when describing how to login :-(
Also, a follow-up question: does "restframework" have to be part of the URL?
