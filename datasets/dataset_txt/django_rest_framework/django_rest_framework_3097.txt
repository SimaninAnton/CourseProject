As seen on https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/djangorestframework/resources.py#L302
# Fall back to ModelForm which we create on the fly
            class OnTheFlyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
                class Meta:
                    model = self.model
                    #fields = tuple(self._model_fields_set)
This does not look right, i would expect default behavior to actually use Resource.fields as protection
