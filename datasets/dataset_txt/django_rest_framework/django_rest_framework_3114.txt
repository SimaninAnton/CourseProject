FormResource should pass along arbitrary kwargs to the form class. This would be helpful when using a ModelForm with the PUT method. You want to be able to pass an existing model instance to be updated...
def put(self, request, name):
    obj = ModelClass.objects.get(name=name)
    form = self.get_bound_form(self.CONTENT, instance=obj)
    return form.save()
So, the updated get_bound_form() method would be:
    def get_bound_form(self, data=None, files=None, method=None, form_kwargs=None):
        """
Given some content return a Django form bound to that content.
If form validation is turned off (:attr:`form` class attribute is :const:`None`) then returns :const:`None`.
"""
        form = self.get_form_class(method)

        if not form:
            return None

        if form_kwargs is None:
            form_kwargs = {}

        if data is not None or files is not None:
            return form(data, files, **form_kwargs)

        return form(**form_kwargs)
