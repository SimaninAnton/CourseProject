When I implement permission system in my resources, I have some problems in checking permission on POST and PUT.
has_permission invoked before deserialization and I must deserialize request in has_permission (obj is None)
It is more usable to add 2 lines to pre_save:
def pre_save(self, obj):
    if not self.has_permission(self.request, obj):
        self.permission_denied(self.request)
    super...
or something like this...
