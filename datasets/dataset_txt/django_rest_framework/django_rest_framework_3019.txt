Hi,
two issues I see myself confronted with right now
Location Header
When Creating a ressource, no Location header is returned. I think this should be added.
When having a ressource on two different endpoints, it would be nice to have a 302-Found (or maybe 303 in some cases?) response with Location header to the ressource
Link Header
Due tu design reasons and as well performance perspective I'd prefer having the possibility of using Link headers to refer to connected Resources or endpoints. As i see it this would be even more HATEOAS and for my purposes usable. It also offers a better kind of structure for browsing the Api.
You know someone's workin on that? Are you planning to do right now?
If not, ii would offer to do so. And maybe you have some thoughts and input on those two topics?
best regards Ludwig
