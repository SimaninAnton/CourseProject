Hi. update_fields was discussed in this issue #1079 and the valid solution was to send update_fields as kwarg argument to serializer's save method (serializer.save(update_fields=[...])). It was possible because of **kwargs in save_object method:
def save_object(self, obj, **kwargs):
        obj.save(**kwargs)
But in DRF>=3.0 there is no such usage of kwargs:
def update(self, obj, attrs):
    for attr, value in attrs.items():
        setattr(obj, attr, value)
    obj.save()
What is the workaround for current problem?
