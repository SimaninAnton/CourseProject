If you call OPTIONS on a model that has fields with choices, the displayed choices are always strings eg:
"account": {
    "type": "field",
    "required": true,
    "read_only": false,
    "label": "Account",
     "choices": [
        {
            "display_name": "Choice 1 Display Name",
            "value": "71518788"
        },
        {
            "display_name": "Choice 2 Display Name",
            "value": "71519217"
        }
        ....etc
Currently for RelatedField, when you request the choices property, all values are converted to strings, but this probably doesn't make sense on things such as PrimaryKeyRelatedField, or other field values which are integers or booleans.
