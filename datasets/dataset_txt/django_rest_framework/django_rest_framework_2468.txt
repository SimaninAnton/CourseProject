I have some fields that should only show on a create or update html form. The best way I found to exclude these fields from a list/retrieve is to specify the field as write_only=True. This works well for create/list/retrieve but breaks the html form in the browseable api for update. The html field is not prepopulated with the current value.
I believe the offending code to be here:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L336
    def field_to_native(self, obj, field_name):
        if self.write_only:
            return None
        return super(WritableField, self).field_to_native(obj, field_name)
