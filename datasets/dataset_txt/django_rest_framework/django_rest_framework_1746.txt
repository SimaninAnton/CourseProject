Hello,
Recently I have run into an issue where I need pagination turned on for a resource endpoint but I also need the ability to optionally return the entire dataset.
AFAIK this isn't a feature that's built into pagination. This comes up when using ember.js framework with ember-data as the framework will automatically try to grab records in certain scenarios but it can't fulfill the requested data because it only gets a subset back.
What I'm wondering is if we could include another query param that would tell the backend to return the full dataset? Example
http://api.myapp.com/v1/organizations/?page_num=all
Let me know your thoughts thanks!
