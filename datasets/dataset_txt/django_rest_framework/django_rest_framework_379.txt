In the docs here: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#django-oauth-toolkit
drf is recommending django-oauth-toolkit:
The package is well documented, and well supported and is currently our recommended package for OAuth 2.0 support.
As far as I know django-oauth-toolkit has no mechanism to avoid brute forcing passwords. I guess we should at least warn users there that it's not immune to brute force.
