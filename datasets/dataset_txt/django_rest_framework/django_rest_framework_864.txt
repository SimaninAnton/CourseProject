I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
# serializers.py
class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = 'title', 'content'


# views.py
class PostView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
I did not set the pagination.
but in the API Documentation
Because generics.views has a default value of 'PageNumberPagination'(in api_settings)
so..
Not getattr (view, 'pagination_class', None) value is always false.
