I'm building an app using Django, DRF, and VueJS. I have a serializer like this:
class ArchivedBookListSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'author', 'nbr_pages', 'volumes', 'url']
I want to change field names to Arabic names so I can display them in the app with these Arabic names.
How can I do this?
Thank you in advance.
