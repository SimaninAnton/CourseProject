Traceback:
File "/home/ugur/project/venv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/rest_framework/renderers.py", line 707, in render
    response = view.get(request, *view.args, **view.kwargs)
AttributeError: 'GGAdvertViewSet' object has no attribute 'get'
So it points that line:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/d738ad7ae603e58eedbc26b186878a199515cb86/rest_framework/renderers.py#L707
The actual problem is; when you use a list_route that accepts only POST method, your view object (on that line 707) will not have a .get method.
Ofcourse workaround is adding simply a 'GET' method to list_route methods list, but it is a dirty solution for a clean api. What is real solution?
