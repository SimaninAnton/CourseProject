when i run makemigrations, Django will also generate a migration for the authtoken app with the following contents
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import models, migrations
from django.conf import settings


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('authtoken', '0001_initial'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='token',
            name='user',
            field=models.OneToOneField(related_name=b'auth_token', to=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL),
        ),
    ]
A really nasty bug .. especially since its so easy to fix with just running ./manage.py makemigrations
Plz run this and include it in a new Version!
