Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
Steps to reproduce
Clone the project link from the given link and change to this tag stage-2-with-error.
Set variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE(must) to config.settings.local
Except sqllite use of most database is accepted, set variable DATABASE_URL(must) in console with yours db url read more under Database setup
Create super admin and login into admin web.
Run the server and go to the swagger http://localhost:[port]/api/docs#!/api/weather_air_pollution_read(in api section and look at the last one).
Expected behavior
Change the pk into weather_date.
Actual behavior

views.py
def retrieve(self, request, weather_date=None):
as shows in the image of retrieve() i have change the argument as weather_date but the swagger is generating only pk and serializer class is viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet and the router in urls.py is DefaultRouter.
