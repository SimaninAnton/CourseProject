In CPython, if indent is anything except None, the C encoder is skipped entirely causing a pretty healthy performance loss, especially on large objects. I don't have any numbers off hand to back this, but it's pretty obvious what implications that could have.
Basically, I'd recommend either disabling that feature entirely, disabling it when DEBUG=False or making a user configuration setting to enable the feature.
There isn't much value in having this in production in most cases, and it's really only useful during development.
I, for one, would absolutely not want the ability for a client request to affect the performance of my app.
