I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a help text in a serializer field that contains a html tag.
Enable the docs page with rest_framework.documentation.include_docs_urls()
Expected behavior
Rendering of the help text is the same all placed.
Actual behavior
In the browsable API form and in the interact window of the docs page where the serializer field is present, html tags are rendered. In the parameter description under the Request Body section in the docs page, the tag is escaped instead so it is displayed.
Further notes
A solution to this must of course be uniform. Furthermore (and I am unsure whether I should create another issue for this) I think line breaks must be possible.
