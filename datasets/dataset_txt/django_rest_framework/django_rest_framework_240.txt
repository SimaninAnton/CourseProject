I am upgrading Django from 1.8 to 2.1.5 and Python 2.7 to 3.6. On the process, I upgraded djangorestframework to 3.8.2 from 3.6.4.
After upgrade, I see this error trace:
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/rest_framework/generics.py", line 26, in
class GenericAPIView(views.APIView):

raise ImportError(msg)
ImportError: Could not import 'rest_framework.filters.DjangoFilterBackend' for API setting 'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS'. AttributeError: module 'rest_framework.filters' has no attribute 'DjangoFilterBackend'.
I am not sure where I am going wrong. Any help on this issue is much appreciated.
