When I was trying to use nested serializers I looked in the docs, and everything seemed fine. However, several issues here on GitHub suggest that nested serializers are partially work in progress. It would be nice to see a message added to the docs (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations#nested-relationships) that mentions the state and/or shortcomings of nested serializers in the newest release.
Some issues concerning writable nested serializers are: #395 #1457 #1513 #1525
