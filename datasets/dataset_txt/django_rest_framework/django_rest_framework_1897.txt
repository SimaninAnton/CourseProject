Hi Tom Christie,
Thanks for this wonderful framework, it great. Maybe this is not the most appropiate question to put here.
I read the license but I just want to make sure about if this django-rest-framework app is absolutely free to use and to know if i'm free to apply my logo on API view instead of the anchor "Django REST framework 3.1.1".
Thanks for your time.
