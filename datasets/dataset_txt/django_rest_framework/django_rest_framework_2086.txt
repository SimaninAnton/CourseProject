Hi,
I have the following serialize class:
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    book = BookSerializer(read_only=True)
    class Meta:
       model = User
When I get the User resource, I want the Book come on serialized with all the model fields, but when I want create a new User and assign a book, I want do this with the Book URI. Is that possible?
Thanks in advance
