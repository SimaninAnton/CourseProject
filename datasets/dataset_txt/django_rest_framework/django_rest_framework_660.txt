Hi there, i am using the built in api documentation from drf 3.6 http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/
I am only able to access the API docs if i am logged into Django admin for example (even if my endpoints do not have any authentication).
Is there a way for me to disable the authentication in the API docs?
Thanks
