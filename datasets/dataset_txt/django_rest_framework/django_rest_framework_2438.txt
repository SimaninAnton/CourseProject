The built-in OAuth support isn't something that we're in a good position to deal with pull requests on.
It has a big dependancy on third party packages, and dealing with issues and pull requests on it requires pretty in-depth knowledge of OAuth in order to properly asses - I'm personally not in a position to do that, as I don't use it for the project I happen to work on.
Furthermore the third-party Django OAuth toolkit package is actually better documented, maintained and supported.
I would like to see us move the OAuth support into a third party package that can be independently maintained, and link to it from the main docs.
