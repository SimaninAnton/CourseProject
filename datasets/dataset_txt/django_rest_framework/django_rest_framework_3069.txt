Currently the django-rest-framework base template does a great job of specifying blocks, so that instead of having to copy the whole template (and risk breaking things in future updates) one can simply write their own template that extends the base one, and then overrides the relevant blocks.
That's all awesome, except for one thing: there is no block around the description output, and the description output escapes HTML by default. We'd like to write our documentation in Markdown, then convert it to HTML, and show that HTML on the API documentation page. However, without a block the only way we can do this currently is to replace the entire template (so that we can add an autoescape off tag).
This fix could be as simple as changing:
<p>{{ description }}</p>
to:
{% block description %}<p>{{ description }}</p>{% endblock %}
but it would probably make more sense (and be more useful to others) if the change was more like:
<div class='content-main'>
    <h1>{{ name }}</h1>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
    ...
to:
{% block content-main %}<div class='content-main'>
    <h1>{{ name }}</h1>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
    ...
{% endblock %}
