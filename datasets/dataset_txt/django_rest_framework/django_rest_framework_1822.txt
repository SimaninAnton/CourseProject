I have a @list_route that look like this
@list_route(methods=['post'])
    def test(self, request):
        queryset = self.filter_queryset(self.get_queryset())
        serializer = self.get_serializer(queryset, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
but when I try to POST to .../events/test/ via browsable API
calling without browsable API is working normally.
I got exactly same error message as #2607 (ListSerializer object is not iterable)
I don't know why this happen? because I want post action to return update objects
However, if i change to this @list_route(methods=['get']) or @list_route(methods=['patch']) it is working fine
My serializer class is a normal class that extends form ModelSerializer
class EventSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Event
