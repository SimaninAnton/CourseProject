A model with a foreign key attribute which has been set to blankable and nullable. And a serializer which has arguments of read_only=False and required=False.
When viewed with the web browseable API we get a drop box which automatically selects the first available foreignkey. Testing with an independant REST post application it was determined that the model was happy to post a null attribute.
Perhaps the correct user experience would be to have a null option in the drop box??
