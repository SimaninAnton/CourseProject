URLPathVersioning and NamespaceVersioning examples use django.conf.urls implicitly and this function is likely to be deprecated (based on the description in the docs).
I'm opening this issue because I tried copy pasting the code and got an error and spend a couple minutes googling where to import the old style url function from. If we can't replace it with path we can at least replace it with re_path. Let me know which one should I use and I'll open a PR.
