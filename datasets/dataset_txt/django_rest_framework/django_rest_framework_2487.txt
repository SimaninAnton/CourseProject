I am running version 2.3.14
From the documentation "The Options Method":
When using the generic views, any OPTIONS requests will additionally respond with metadata regarding any POST or PUT actions available, describing which fields are on the serializer.
So I would expect that ModelViewSet would also return such information in an OPTIONS request. But it is not the case for me.
I would also like to take this chance to suggest adding the available filters, search, and ordering fields to the response.
