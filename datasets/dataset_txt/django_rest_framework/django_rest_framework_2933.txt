Hello,
I have found that when I request the creation of an instance with a POST, the instance is created successfully, but the response that I get (as JSON) is exactly the same than the one that I have sent. So... the thing is that the response does not fill the primary key value. Is that the pretended behavior or should the framework return the instance with the primary key filled after saving the instance?
For instance, if I send:
{ "id": null, "a": "1" }
I actually receive the same thing, but I think that I it would be convenient to receive:
{ "id": (an integer), "a": "1" }
