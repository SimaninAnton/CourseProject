Problem statement
Looking at the 3.0 docs, it's unclear if searching will work on a ViewSet, or if I have to use a GenericView class.
Explanation
The documentation at http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter gives an example using generics.ListAPIView as the parent class.
If I read all the documentation on the ViewSet page, I would know that it will work as ModelViewSet class inherits from GenericAPIView but this certainly wasn't obvious to me when first reading through the docs on the search page.
Proposed Solution
What I'd like to see is the /api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter section of the documentation include an example for searching on a class that inherits from a ViewSet.
