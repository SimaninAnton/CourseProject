If I run the following with the JSONRenderer:
raise AuthenticationFailed(detail=['one', 'two'])
In version 2.3.13 of djangorestframework this correctly output:
{"detail": ["one", "two"]}
But if I upgrade to 3.0.5 it incorrectly outputs:
{"detail": "['one', 'two']"}
Outputting the list as a string representation, rather than an array.
