I have a nested serializer that looks like:
classs FooSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    field_1 = serializers.Field('method1')
    field_2 = serializers.Field('method2')
And I use it like this:
class MyMainSerializer(serializer.ModelSerializer):
    foo = FooSerializer(source='*')
And testing it against master, though a CreateView I get:
TypeError: '*' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
By debugging I found the error is raised here:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/mixins.py#L45
I git checkout backwards and it seems to begin happen after this commit:
9bf7c9b#L2L212
I couldn't reproduce it from python shell. Any ideas?
