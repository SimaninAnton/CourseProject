For example I have User and Profile model with one-to-one relation. I have defined ProfileSerializers like:
 class ProfileSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializers)

      class Meta:
           model = Profile
           depth = 1
This will get user information. Now, I want to exclude password field. I know there's way when I define UserSerializers. I was wondering if there's way do so without defining UserSerializer (or while using depth).
Thanks
