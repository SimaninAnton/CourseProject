Currently the CreateModelMixin is hardcoded to use status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST when validation fails.
It should be possible to override that status code on a per request basis. E.g. 409 Conflict, etc depending on what went wrong.
It would mostly be logical to specify this error code when raising a validation error, the only tricky case would be when there is more than one validation error code (e.g. 400 because of a missing field, 409 because some part of the request conflicts), in this case the easy option would be to default back to 400 when there are status conflicts.
