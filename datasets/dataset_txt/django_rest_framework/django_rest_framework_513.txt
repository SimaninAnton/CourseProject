Background:
My Django Backend needs to leave open webhooks endpoints for the Internet for example SocialMedia, ... etc
Therefore I have to create the whitelist to protect my database
I would like this think as a feature
client = APIClient()
client.set(remote_addr='111.111.111.111')
Or if you have any workaround on this issue. Please let me know.
I had tried asking for the answer from stackoverflow, but non of them satisfy my requirement
