For your consideration.
I've implemented a RetrieveAPIView by providing the get_serializer and get_object functions. This worked fine until commit 1a8f07d where the object retrieval order was changed to allow filtering and now always calls get_queryset. I now get the error message:
ImproperlyConfigured: v1_Job_Detail is missing a queryset. Define v1_Job_Detail.model, v1_Job_Detail.queryset, or override v1_Job_Detail.get_object().
This is very confusing at first, because I have overridden get_object()
The Django sources and documentation and the above error message indicate that it is sufficient to implement get_object(), however, the RetrieveAPIView overrides that behaviour.
The situation can either be fixed by applying filtering only to the results of get_object or adding a statement in the documentation.
