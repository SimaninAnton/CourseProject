If a field is made read_only by DRF automatically by virtue of being a relation with a through-class and the field is also made required automatically by virtue of being used in a uniqueness constraint, the read_only and required arguments clash due to ModelSerializer.include_extra_kwargs only checking for read_only in extra_kwargs.
