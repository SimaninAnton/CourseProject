Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
I would like to use Markdown to write API documentation, of course, the real method, similar to
|参数|描述|
|:--|:--|
|page|第几页|
|limit|条数|
Actual behavior
In fact he will automatically render a line of strings
does django-rest automatically generate API documentation for more detailed instructions?
In production, we are using APIView.
