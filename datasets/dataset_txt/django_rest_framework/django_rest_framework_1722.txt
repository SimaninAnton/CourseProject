The documentation states that the IPAddressField takes unpack_ipv4 as an argument, which is False by default and can only be used when protocol is 'both' (which is in line with Django's GenericIPAddressField).
When I try to use this option, I get an exception:
TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'unpack_ipv4'
It looks like IPAddressField.__init__ sets unpack_ipv4 to True if the protocol is 'both' (which is contrary to the docs): https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/dee5fb56479edc05cd0dcc827607696e58710eda/rest_framework/fields.py#L683
