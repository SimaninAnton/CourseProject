Hi,
PageNumberPagination works well when the table it's small, but when the table it's big and the amount of result are big django.core.paginator.Paginator always make count for the full queryset.
https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/paginator.py#L86
Cursor pagination works great, but orderingFilter will be lost and it's not useful at all in our case.
Any way to clean this count property from the PageNumberPagination?
Regards.
