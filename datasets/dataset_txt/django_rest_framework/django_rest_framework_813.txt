Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Send a DELETE request to an APIView that has permissions_classes set, but no delete method.
Expected behavior
Should receive HTTP 405 Method not allowed
Actual behavior
Receive HTTP 403 or HTTP 401
According to the HTTP Decision Diagram (not an RFC, but supposedly built according to the relevant RFCs), HTTP 405 should be returned if the method isn't allowed, even if the user is not authenticated. Due to the way Django dispatches views, it checks permissions and thus raises permissions-related errors before checking to see if the appropriate verb method exists.
I will attach a PR with a failing test shortly.
