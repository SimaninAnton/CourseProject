Hello,
When I set:
parser_classes = (parsers.FileUploadParser,)
In my ModelViewSet, in the HTML view, I can only see attributes related to the file upload (Media Type and Content).
I am not sure if this is intended or not, however it is kind of unfortunate as other the fields are still important.
Only a minor issue, but thought I would check.
Thanks
