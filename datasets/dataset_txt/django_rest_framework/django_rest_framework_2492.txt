I'm building a select widget and noticed that the ID is being appended to the end of the string in label_from_instance() [1].
My use case is presenting this data to end users which can be confusing. Feels like it should just return desc = smart_text(obj) and let the developer decide what it ultimately displayed.
Most likely I'm missing something but I was curious what the benefit of this is and why it's there?
