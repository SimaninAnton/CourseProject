Very similar to #2455.
When the Browsable API clones requests to check the permissions on other methods, it doesn't clone the versioning_scheme attribute and this causes reverse lookups to fail.
ImproperlyConfigured: Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "aggregator-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the `lookup_field` attribute on this field.
