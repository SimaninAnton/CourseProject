Currently I'm maintaining my own version of serializers.UUIDField, simply to control the output format (I prefer the hex representation). Would you be open to adding a format parameter to the field's initializer which determined the output representation to be one of:
'hex_verbose' (or None): Hex formating including hyphens
'hex': Compact hex representation
'int': integer representation
'urn': RFC 4122 URN representation
I'll follow it up with a PR if you've got no problems.
