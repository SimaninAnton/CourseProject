I am iterating over a model where a certain property is only present some of the time. If I use this in my serializer:
open = serializers.Field(source='threadedcomment.open')
I get this when an instance is hit with that property missing:
'ThreadedComment' object has no attribute 'open'
Documentation at http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields notes there is a default option: "If set, this gives the default value that will be used for the field if no input value is supplied. " But I do this:
open = serializers.Field(source='threadedcomment.open', default="foo")
I get:
__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'default'
Thanks.
