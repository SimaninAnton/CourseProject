Steps to reproduce
While trying to raise a rest_framework.serializers.ValidationError, I noticed that the following code does not change the status_code
raise serializers.ValidationError('An error', code=HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
After some checks, however, I found that I had to do
api_exception = serializers.ValidationError(err_obj)
api_exception.status_code = HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND
raise api_exception
I just wanted to suggest that we add the status_code property to the ValidationError as this is more intuitive. What do you think
Expected Behaviour
The following ought to change the status code to 404
raise serializers.ValidationError('An error', status_code=HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
