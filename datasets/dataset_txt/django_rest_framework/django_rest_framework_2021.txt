It may be a good idea to allow raising SkipField not only from get_attribute, but also from to_representation. At the moment, it is only possible to raise SkipField from get_attribute.
My use case for this is pretty special though. I am currently working on an inline expansion package for DRF 3. Slightly delaying the decision about whether or not a field should be skipped could make things a little bit easier for me.
