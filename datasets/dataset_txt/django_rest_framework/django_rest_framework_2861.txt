It appears that the session authentication always ignores a view being decorated as csrf_exempt.
When the middleware is called at https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/authentication.py#L120 it doesn't pass the callback.
Not sure if its possible to pass the callback here.
