After upgrading from 3.8 -> 3.9 I've encountered an issue with the new limit_choices_to foreign key changes.
filter() argument after ** must be a mapping, not Q
It seems the issue was documented in the original merge and a fix was proposed but I can't find an existing PR that has addressed it - nor does the proposed fix exist in master
#6371 (comment)
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
model with FK that contains a limit_choices_to with Q object reference ( instead of Dictionary)
Expected behavior
no errors, code works as expected if a dictionary is passed instead
Actual behavior
error thrown,
filter() argument after ** must be a mapping, not Q
