During a workshop on Django REST framework, I realized the browsable API doesn't have links to the list_route / detail_route actions.
While I started working on implementing it I realized it should be the ViewSet responsibility to provide a list of custom actions. Currently all the work is done by the Router.
I'm opening the issue to discuss the possible directions.
My first though was to move the code that gathers the custom actions to the ViewSet. However, I'm not too happy with it as it relies on the ViewSet members having or not a bind_to_methods attribute attached.
My proposal would be to have two lists (possibly dictionaries) within the ViewSet that do hold the list_route and detail_route members. The decorator would then register their member to the ViewSet.
Thoughts ?
