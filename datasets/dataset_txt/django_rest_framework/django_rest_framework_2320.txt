Sporadically raised request:
lookup_fields on generic views and hyperlinked fields, instead of the existing lookup_field.
I've pushed back hard on this in the past:
I want to prioritise for the simplest possible case. (I need to expand on why further, but 'complexity feedback loop')
Hyperlinked relational fields are complicated enough to understand even with a single lookup field.
Tend to think that nested styles are often awkward API design.
Opening this as a place for any further discussion/consideration.
