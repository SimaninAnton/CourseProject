#3908 - this fix ensures that every type of variable in the exception response is rendered as a string value in JSON. I know that there's a workaround for avoiding that but it's rather "non-robust" (because it requires overriding init), and I just think it's strange to enforce string for all fields without any specific reason. Therefore, can that function be made in more conventional way, e.g. to skip conversion of numbers to strings?
