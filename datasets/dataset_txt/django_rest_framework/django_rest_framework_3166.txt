Using UserLoggedInAuthentication causes all the POST data to be removed from any POST request because of this line b508ca3#L0R92
class TestView(View):
    authentication = (UserLoggedInAuthentication,)

    def post(self, request):
        return request.POST # Returns <QueryDict: {}> no matter what post data was sent
