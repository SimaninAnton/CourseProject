I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Hi! Thanks for maintaining this library! I'm attempting to upgrade a project that has existing API documentation from DRF 3.9.4 to DRF 3.10.0 and I'm encountering the following error message when trying to use AutoSchema:
AttributeError at /api/docs/
'AutoSchema' object has no attribute 'get_link'
I've attempted to reduce it to its most minimal form by removing all the places where we are subclassing AutoSchema but I still encounter the error when trying to load the documentation.
For background: our docs are presented using Django-REST-Swagger, and I also updated the statement which imports AutoSchema from
from rest_framework.schemas.inspectors import AutoSchema
to
from rest_framework.schemas.coreapi import AutoSchema
I may just be missing the right incantation to say to get this to work. Do you have any suggestions on having this upgrade work without having to undertake substantial code changes?
Expected behavior
Upgrading from 3.9.4 to 3.10.0 does not break existing API documentation.
Actual behavior
Upgrading from 3.9.4 to 3.10.0 does break existing API documentation.
