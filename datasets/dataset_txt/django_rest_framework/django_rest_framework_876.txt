[*] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[*] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[*] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[*] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)

Steps to reproduce
Create a simple ModelSerializer with a ManyRelatedField, with no required parameter, such as:
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
   groups = serializers.StringRelatedField(many=True, queryset=...)
   ...
Then groups field is required or not depending on the input data format:
groups is required when sending json object to create a User (for example, from the "Raw Data" tab on the API test page with 'application/json' as input media type)
groups is not required when using form data as input (for example, from the "HTML form" tab on the API test page)
Expected behavior
The behavior should be consistent and should not depend on the input data format.
Actual behavior
ManyRelatedField is required or not depending on the input data format.
