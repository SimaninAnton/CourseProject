get_parser_context always returns an empty args and kwargs because it depends on args & kwargs being set, and dispatch calls initialize_request before setting the variables.
Either get_parser_context needs to be passed args and kwargs, or dispatch needs to set args and kwargs before invoking initialize_request.
Additionally, FileUploadParser is fine returning None as a filename, but the standard filehandlers do not create a file in that circumstance, causing request.FILES['file'] to not be invoked.
