ChoiceField is handy, it gives choices in metadata, so I can take it from OPTIONS query and make a fancy form with just one request.
Problem appears when I have ForeignKey on really fat model. I don't want to make request for these models.
But since no one fk-field provides any data in metadata(and there is no option for this feature), I'm forced to write new field type or deal with 2 requests.
Any suggestions? Maybe it should be a feature to provide choices in metadata?
