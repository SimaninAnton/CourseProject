Say I have serializers as below.
class AbcSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
 class Meta:
  model = Abc
  fields = ('a',) # there could be other fields too in model.


class XyzSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

 a = AbcSerializer(many=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Xyz
        fields = '__all__'  
this gives me list of dictionaries like
[{a: 1}, {a: 2}]  
is there any parameter like flat=True, which would give me a flat list like
[1, 2]
