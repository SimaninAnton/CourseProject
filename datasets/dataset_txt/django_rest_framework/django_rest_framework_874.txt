Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
class AccountViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """Viewset for user accounts.

    list:
    Gets admin the list of all users.

    update:
    Updates the account info, can be done only by admin and owner.
    """

    lookup_field = 'username'
    queryset = Account.objects.all()
    serializer_class = AccountSerializer
Expected behavior
The
tag must not be there.
Actual behavior
We see a
tag as in the image
