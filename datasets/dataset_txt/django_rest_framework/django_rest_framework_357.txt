Steps to reproduce
ModelSerializer.create() does not work for models with custom managers, in case if there is no model.objects manager.
Small failing example:
class Model(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    all_objects = models.Manager()

class TestModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Model
                fields = ('name',)

TestModelSerializer().create({'name': 'test_name'})
Expected behavior
Object should be created, either using default managers create(), or just by creating model instance and saving it.
Actual behavior
Exception is raised:
rest_framework/serializers.py:940: in create
    instance = ModelClass.objects.create(**validated_data)
E   AttributeError: type object 'IssueNewTestModel' has no attribute 'objects'
