In 2.x exception strings were not translatable. In 3.0 this was fixed and force_text was included to evaluate the translation strings. As a side effect this broke free-form exception styles that were unintentionally supported in 2.x.
We should decide if we want to support free form exception styles. Generally my preference would be not, but on the other hand it'd be an easier upgrade from 2.x if we do.
