In the API Guide for Viewsets, it explains how you can create a dynamic queryset by overriding the definition of get_queryset().
If you do that though, you need to set the model on the Viewset. The example in the docs does not set the model. If you don't, you'll get an error:
'name not argument not specified, and could not automatically determine the name from the viewset, as it does not have a .model or .queryset attribute.'
from get_default_base_name() in SimpleRouter.
Or, quite possibly, there's something I'm doing wrong.
