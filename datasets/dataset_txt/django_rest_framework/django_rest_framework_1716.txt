I am testing my REST API in the test server (manage.py runserver and using the self-written JS application), the test framework (manage.py test) and with httpie. It seems that in viewset methods self.request is always a rest_framework.request.Request, but self.request.data is a django.http.request.QueryDict with runserver and test, but using runserver with httpie results in self.request.data being a plain dict.
Is there a (documented) reason behind this? If not, it would be nice to make this more straightforward. Currently I have to use some extra, seemingly unnecessary checks like
params = self.request.data
if isinstance(params, QueryDict):
    params = params.dict()
although I havenâ€™t yet found a dict case other than using httpie.
