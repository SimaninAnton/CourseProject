Hello everyone, newcomer to DRF here. I just started learning how to use DRF yesterday and noticed the tutorials (part 1 at least, not sure about the other parts) have not been updated to use the latest Django 2.0 URL routing syntax.
For example,
from django.conf.urls import url
from snippets import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^snippets/$', views.snippet_list),
    url(r'^snippets/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/$', views.snippet_detail),
]
should be
from django.urls import re_path
from snippets import views

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^snippets/$', views.snippet_list),
    re_path(r'^snippets/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/$', views.snippet_detail),
]
Alternatively, the path() function can be used. I'd be more than happy to help with updating the tutorials but I'm not sure how (never contributed to open source before). I assume I can start by cloning the repo, make the changes in the tutorial markdown files, and then make a pull request?
