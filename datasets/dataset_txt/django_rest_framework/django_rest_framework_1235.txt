Picking up where the #3143 ended.. in our API implementation we generally order by a combination of a millisecond accuracy timestamp and pk, e.g.
class ModifiedOnCursorPagination(CursorPagination):
    ordering = ('-modified_on', '-pk')
It's possible sometimes for large numbers of items to end up with the same timestamp so we've been overriding decode_cursor so that we can increase OFFSET_CUTOFF (malicious queries are less of a concern in this case). Seems like that value could be configurable though, so happy to make a simple PR if there's a consensus on whether it should be a class variable or settings value.
