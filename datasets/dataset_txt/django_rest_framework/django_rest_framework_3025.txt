Edit Updated title from 'Nested serializers should allow validation' to better reflect the ticket.
I have an application that uses multiple nested data structures (sometimes deeply nested). We are planning on migrating our existing custom framework to use Django REST framework but it looks like we won't be able to since validation of nested serializers isn't possible.
I am interested either finding a way around this restriction or adding support for nested serialization to Django REST framework.
