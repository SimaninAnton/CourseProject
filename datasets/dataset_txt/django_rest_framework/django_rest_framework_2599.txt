I've followed http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering#orderingfilter.
I'm using django-filter.
my viewset is very simple
class FlatOpinionViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Opinione.objects.all()
    serializer_class = FlatOpinionSerializer
    ordering_fields = '__all__'
I've tried to get opinions ordered by title calling
http://www.example.com/api/public/1/opinions?ordering=title
but that returns opinions (records) always ordered by id.
I've tried various combinations without success, am I missing something?
FlatOpinionSerializer is nothing special, is a classic ModelSerializer (and it has the field "title" ofc).
Thanks!
