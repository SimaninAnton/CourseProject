In the Tutorial 4: Authentication & Permissions documentation under "Associating Snippets with Users" it says to add the following method to the SnippetList view class.
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    serializer.save(owner=self.request.user)
However when trying to create a snippet you get this error.
Request Method: POST
Request URL:    http://127.0.0.1:8000/snippets/
Django Version: 1.7.1
Exception Type: AssertionError
Exception Value:    
The `.create()` method does not support writable dotted-source fields by default.
Write an explicit `.create()` method for serializer `snippets.serializers.SnippetSerializer`, or set `read_only=True` on dotted-source serializer fields.
