Please consider adding a feature to allow models to be serialized and deserialized under a "json root" (commonly the model's name or plural name).
{modelname: {modelattr:value, modelattr2: value2}} 
It's possible to do this already by overriding list/create/update/retrieve methods on the API views but it would be a very handy pattern to support oob.
At the moment, my mini project django-on-fire addresses this issue but it does so in a way that requires me to override all the methods listed above and then virtually copy their code with a slight modification. It would be cleaner and more desirable if this option were part of base classes as my views will not then fall behind other features that may be included in the views they inherit from.
Finally, this would lay the groundwork for sideloading under jsonroots, a feature that many front-ends are favoring for reducing HTTP request volume.
