Currently rest framework supports validating a single field or a collection of fields on a serializer. However, if a serializer is instantiated with many=True I don't see a way to validate a condition for all instances being deserialized.
My use case is a collection of required items that should be present somewhere in the collection of objects to be deserialized, but aren't required on any specific instance.
I was able to implement this by editing a copy of BaseSerializer.errors in my Serializer, but it would be cleaner with native support.
