I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Set DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES to only rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication.
Add the built-in API documentation routes with public=True
Expected behavior
In the sidebar, at the bottom in the Authentication section, only the none and token options should be available in accordance with the authentication_classes parameter of the docs setup.
Actual behavior
All authentication methods are shown although only none and token will actually work.
