When using ModelViewSet, URL parameters are not being handled correctly.
Steps to reproduce
# In my views.py
class ExampleView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = serializers.ExampleSerializer

    def get_queryset(self, fid=-1):
        print(fid)

# In my urls.py file
path('examples/<int:fid>/', views.ExampleView.as_view(actions={'get': 'list'}))
If I do not include fid as a positional argument, the request will result in an error, claiming it must be included in the get_queryset() method. However, if I pass a value into the URL as part of a request, for example, to:
localhost/examples/2/
Expected behavior
prints 2
Actual behavior
prints -1
Then the value that is printed out will be -1 instead of 2. Not sure what I could be doing wrong, in the mean time, GET parameters could be used instead, as a workaround.
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
