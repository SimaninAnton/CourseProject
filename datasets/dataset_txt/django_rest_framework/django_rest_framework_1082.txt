Since I upgraded from version 3.3.3 to version 3.4 I'm have problems with routers
File "/urls.py", line 23, in
urlpatterns = router.urls
File "/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/rest_framework/routers.py", line 81, in urls
self._urls = self.get_urls()
File "/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/rest_framework/routers.py", line 358, in get_urls
view = self.get_api_root_view(api_urls=urls)
TypeError: get_api_root_view() got an unexpected keyword argument 'api_urls'
