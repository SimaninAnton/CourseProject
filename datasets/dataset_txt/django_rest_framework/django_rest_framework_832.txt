Hello!
I am in the process of upgrading Django REST Framework from version 2 to 3.6 in a production application and in the process of debugging I ran into this quite interesting error, when I tried to access a Browserable API viewset:
TypeError at /api/internal/users
get_rendered_html_form() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)
The interesting part is that there is no code of our application in this exception. Also, based in get_rendered_html_form nothing should be going wrong (I have attached the local variables at this point below).
Any idea why and how might this be happening. If we identify the issue, I am more than happy to put up a PR for fixing this, if applicable.
DRF-related packages version
Django==1.8.2
djangorestframework==3.6.2
drf-compound-fields==1.0.0
django-rest-framework-mongoengine==3.3.1
