I'm getting a ton of warnings when I updated to las Django version, the problem arises when including DRF url in my project urls.
url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),
django.conf.urls.patterns() is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10. Update your urlpatterns to be a list of django.conf.urls.url() instances instead.
