[NA] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[yes] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[No] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
In Tutorial 1: Serialization, when creating the Snippets model in snippets/models.py, the variable STYLE_CHOICES is assigned:
STYLE_CHOICES = sorted( (item, item) for item in get_all_styles() )
The global function sorted() expects a list, or an iterable. However this is not being given. STYLE_CHOICES should be generated by using a list comprehension just like LANGUAGE_CHOICES variable defined immediately before it.
Expected behavior
STYLE_CHOICES should be a list and assigned the following:
STYLE_CHOICES = sorted( [(item, item) for item in get_all_styles()] )
Actual behavior
snippets/models.py currently fails as sorted is not being given a list or an iterable.
