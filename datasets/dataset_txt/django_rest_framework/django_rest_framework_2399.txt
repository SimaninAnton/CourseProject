We should include a serializer IPAddressField which is mapped to by Django's models.IPAddressField and models.GenericIPAddressField. Note that we should only need a single class, which should support both the model classes. (Note that the older IPAddressField is being deprecated in Django, in favour of GenericIPAddressField.)
