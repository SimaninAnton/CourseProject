Hello,
please, add search_param and ordering_param property value into settings file, so it can be configurable such as PAGINATE_BY_PARAM.
[filters.py]
class SearchFilter(BaseFilterBackend):
search_param = 'search'
...
class OrderingFilter(BaseFilterBackend):
ordering_param = 'ordering'
...
Thank you
