I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Use latest version on django-guardian 1.4.2
djangorestframework 3.3.3
on Python 3.4
File "/rest_framework/filters.py", line 309, in filter_queryset
if guardian.VERSION >= (1, 3):
TypeError: unorderable types: list() >= tuple()
on Python 2.7
guardian.VERSION >= (1, 3) always False
currently in filters.py:309 -
if guardian.VERSION >= (1, 3):
on python 2.7 always False
replace to -
if guardian.VERSION >= [1, 3]:
