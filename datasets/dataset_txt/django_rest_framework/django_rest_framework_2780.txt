In my experience, using the queryset attribute in the generic views is unpredictable, depending on the deployment platform the Django REST Framework is using.
In many cases this attribute will be evaluated exactly once per thread and any subsequent request that uses that thread's view will serialize the same result set. It's like caching, when you don't ask for it.
Unless we can improve consistency for this attribute's evaluation, can we go back to recommending the model shortcut when get_queryset isn't used and start recommending against the queryset attribute?
This may have been fixed since the last time I tested, but I haven't seen any commits related to it. If it's been fixed, apologies for this unnecessary request.
