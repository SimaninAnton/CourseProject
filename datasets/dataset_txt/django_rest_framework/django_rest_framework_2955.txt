Hi, folks :) I want to use rest framework with jquery js client. Now my requests blocked by "Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin". Is it possible to allow requests for all or specified hosts?
I think about this solution:
Modify header of all responses(i need to change default response class for this, because i'm using generic classes and response creating inside them)
Thanks for any comments :)
