The default html template (api.html in my branch) should be updated to follow the updates that have been applied to the admin and should declare an html5 doctype instead of xhtml. Django has already lead the way with this with 1.4 which will be released in a few weeks:
https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/base.html
We should declare an html5 doctype and clean up the template to be more in line with the default style. We could also lean on the default admin css style (only declaring what is different) in our own css.
Furthermore, I move that xhtml support should be dropped or at least moved to using a different rendering template than the html5 one. The current template doesn't validate as xhtml so I doubt it is being used.
What do you think?
