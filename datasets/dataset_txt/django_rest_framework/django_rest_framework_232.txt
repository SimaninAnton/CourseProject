I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Write a custom viewsets.ModelViewSet subclass and implement perform_create(self, serializer)
Run into an error in perform_create.
Expected behavior
I can return a custom Response with the error message in JSON format
Actual behavior
Return values are https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/2b6245db5359571f10d27ace16473d70e160dce2/rest_framework/mixins.py#L21
The HTTP status code is always HTTP_201_CREATED
