I am connected a DRF backend to a GraphQL endpoint. In GraphQL, you can paginate with a cursor and specify a page_size like this:
viewer {
   items(first: 10, after: "some_id") {
      edges {
         node {
            name
         }
      }
   }
}
I do not think it is possible to do that with CursorPagination in DRF. Would this feature be feasible ?
