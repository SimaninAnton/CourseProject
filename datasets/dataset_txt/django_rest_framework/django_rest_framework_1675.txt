Hi there so i am using Django Rest Framework 3.1 and i was wondering if its possible to "protect" my viewsets / database against writes in a per user basis?
In other words if 1 user is saving something the other one cannot save and it either waits till the first user finishes or returns some kind of error.
I tried looking for this answer but couldn't find it.
Is this behavior already implemented? if not how can i achieve this in practice?
cheers
