I have a detail_route (defined in a mixin class) that is throwing rest_framework.exceptions.ValidationError based on the input. When the client sends request as PATCH and the error fires, the response comes back empty. When I send with POST, the Validation error message gets returned in the response, but as a list (['my error message']) rather than a dict key'd with detail.
Why is no response coming back on PATCH? In either case, why isn't the normally formatted response coming back ({ "detail" : "my error message"})
