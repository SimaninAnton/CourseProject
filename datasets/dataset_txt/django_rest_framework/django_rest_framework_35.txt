In this repository I find:
2-clause BSD at https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/__init__.py#L13
3-clause BSD at https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/LICENSE.md
Both seem to refer tothe same thing: The DRF codebase as a whole. Which statement is correct?
