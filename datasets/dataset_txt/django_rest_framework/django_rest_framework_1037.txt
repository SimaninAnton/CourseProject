I've made a test which succeeds on Django 1.9 but fails on Django 1.10.

It fails due to a change in django.contrib.auth.authenticate in Django 1.10 which no longer returns a user if it is inactive. (https://github.com/django/django/blob/1.10.1/django/contrib/auth/backends.py#L23)
It can be reproduced by running the test on Django 1.9 and Django 1.10.
The expected behavior is that the view returns "'User account is disabled." in Django 1.10, but for me this is not a needed functionality, returning ''Unable to log in with provided credentials." is fine for me as well.
