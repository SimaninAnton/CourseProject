Steps to reproduce
I have a model with four fields. One is boolean where blank is allowed and three others are required char fields. I have a model serializer that uses this model. In serializer meta, I have fields='__all__'
I instantiate the serializer with instance=None, partial=True and data={}. Now I do serializer.is_valid()
I change meta field fields to (char_field2, char_field3, boolean_field)
Expected behavior
serializer.errors should have a dict with three keys in it.
serializer.errors should have a dict with two keys(char_field2, char_field3) in it.
Actual behavior
serializer.errors is this {'char_field1': [u'This field is required.'], 'char_field2': [u'This field is required.']}
serializer.errors now contains {'char_field1': [u'This field is required.'], 'char_field2': [u'This field is required.'], 'char_field3': [u'This field is required.']}
