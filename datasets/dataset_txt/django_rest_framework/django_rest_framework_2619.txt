Hi guys, maybe this is not an issue but it's just me that I don't understand well how to use your framework (this is both my first time with python, django and rest_framework all together).
I've created a simple serializers.WritableField
 class JsonField(serializers.WritableField):
    def to_native(self, value):
        return json.loads(value)

    def field_from_native(self, data, files, field_name, reverted_data):
        return json.dumps(data.get(field_name, '{}'))
The method field_from_native is called correctly and it's doing it's job returning (I've checked) the value I want it to return.
The problem is that that value returned is not used in the Serializer that use JsonField.
Instead if I just implement from_native (but I need to use field_from_native) it works perfectly as intended.
Can you explain me why?
