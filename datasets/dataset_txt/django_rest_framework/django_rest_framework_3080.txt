Just creating this issue to track this thread on the discussion group:

The best suggestion seems to be Tom's option 3 on his second reply:
Only respect IE accept headers if the HTTP header "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" is set - indicating an AJAX request. Should do the trick in most circumstances, but leaves a dodgy corner case for IE if you're using an AJAX client library that doesn't set that header.
AFAIK all popular Ajax client libs set the header correctly, so this should solve the issue in most cases.
