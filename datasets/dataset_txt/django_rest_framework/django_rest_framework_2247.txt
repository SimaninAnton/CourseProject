I have a serializer field, where source is specified.
Example:
    my_amount_field = serializers.DecimalField(
        source='my_amount_field.amount', required=False)
Serialization is working how expected.
But when it comes to deserialization, it have a strange behavior.
See this line:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/version-2.4.x/rest_framework/fields.py#L372
What purpose of self.source or field_name?
With source specified, it writes my_amount_field.amount as key to into, so my data is not saving.
When I removed self.source or (into[field_name] = value) it works fine.
Note: my_amount_field is a real field in model, but i need to override it by specifying serializers.DecimalField in serializer to get my_amount_field.amount as a result value.
Is it a bug?
