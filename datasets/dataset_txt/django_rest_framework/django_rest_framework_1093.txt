Hi, I am using that view for my project and noticed that if I specify the username and password of an inactive user (is_active=False) it fails, but the message is "Unable to log in with provided credentials.". Looking at the code at https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/authtoken/serializers.py it seems that the message should be "User account is disabled" but it isn't.
This problem happens becuase django.contrib.auth.authenticate returns None for an inactive user.
I think that getting the model and doing a check_password call instead of calling authenticate should fix it, but I'm not sure if this will break the compatibility with custom auth backends so I wanted to confirm it before sending a pull request.
