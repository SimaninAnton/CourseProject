at the moment if you would validate field by using data from more than one field, you need to place your validation code in validate method of a serializer.
unfortunatelly at this momet you loose a possibility to assign error to specific fields, each ValidationError exception will add this message to non_field_errors list.
I would like to propose to add a new parameter field to existing ValidationError or a new exception FieldValidationError with this parameter.
This will allow more granular control of the error descriptions, which than can be used by client to pinpoint source of errors (e.g. to highlight errorneous field(s))
