self.object = self.get_object_or_none()
if self.object is None:
            created = True
            save_kwargs = {'force_insert': True}
            success_status_code = status.HTTP_201_CREATED
        else:
            created = False
            save_kwargs = {'force_update': True}
            success_status_code = status.HTTP_200_OK
Above is a code excerpt from rest_framwork.mixins.UpdateModelMixin. It forces insertion if the target object to update does not exist. I don't think this behaviour is always desired. In some situation, it might be more appropriate to raise exception than insert a new record. Especially when you consider partial update that leads to an insertion with partial data, that does not quite make sense. I think there should be a way to disable force insertion when update request is targeted at non-existing object. Any thoughts?
