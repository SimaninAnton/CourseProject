I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Lets take a model
class Item(models.Model):
    id = BigAutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
When id is outside javascript mantissa range (>=2^53) it is rounded to fit the floating point representation. It leads to many unpredictable code breaks and bugs. It can be reproduced in API documentation where you cannot operate on objects outside of the range.
Expected behavior
Assuming standard routes for Item model.
In documentation API for the route item-detail when you try to retrieve details for id=1474526976323617798 it should be evaluated to route GET /items/1474526976323617798/
Actual behavior
The route is evaluated to:
GET /items/1474526976323617800/
