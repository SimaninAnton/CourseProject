After upgrading from 2.3.12 to 2.3.13 the QUERY_PARAMS are always empty.
class MyViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    ...

    def get_queryset(self):
        a_param = self.request.QUERY_PARAMS.get('foo')
        if a_param == 'bar':
            ...
Has the functionality changed around this? I saw nothing in the release notes.
NOTE This only affects testing
