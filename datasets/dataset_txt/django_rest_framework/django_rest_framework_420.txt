The current recommandation for implementing HTTP Signature Authentication, available here recommends the following module:
https://github.com/etoccalino/django-rest-framework-httpsignature
https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework-httpsignature/
That module has not been updated in almost 3 years and contains a very broken rsa implementation.
See: etoccalino/django-rest-framework-httpsignature#13
You should update the recommandation for https://github.com/ahknight/drf-httpsig which is properly maintained and has an available pypi release named drf-httpsig
