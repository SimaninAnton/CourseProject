The documentation on DateTimeField includes the format and input_format keyword arguments, but it is missing the default_timezone argument.
Normally users won't have to worry about this if they have USE_TZ set in the django app settings because DateTimeField.default_timezone handles everything for them, but thats not always the case. I think adding some documentation around it would be helpful for those individuals.
