With POST requests there's a hard check that urls end with a /, with PATCH that doesn't occur. I'm assuming this is because the check is done by django for POST requests, but not PATCH as standard django doesn't support it?
This caused me a lot of grief today both the initial problem, then finding it.
I see this isn't actually a bug, but I think a fix which raises an exception and returns a 500 response as with POST would be prudent.
Currently the request seems to get all the way to the view's save method with request.DATA==None, which seems like the wrong behaviour.
