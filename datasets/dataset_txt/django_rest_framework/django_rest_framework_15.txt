The way the routers are currently designed they currently only really accommodate a flat toplevel API. However, I'd like to have an API per app in my project such that the name of the app is a prefix in the path. The toplevel API would list all the registered sub-routers and their corresponding paths:
/api/app1/
/api/app2/
/app/app3/
Once clicking on a link for a given app, you should get the list of all registered viewsets for that router:
/api/app1/viewset1/
/api/app1/viewset2/
/api/app1/viewset3/
I've seen solutions in which people use the extend method of the router class to extend the toplevel router with the urls of sub-routers, however, that still lists all of the APIs on the toplevel render nor does it isolate the apps such that viewsets of the same name in different apps don't conflict. Can I suggest a router for routers if that makes sense? Or any means of isolate app routes while providing customization as to how to render the toplevel API?
