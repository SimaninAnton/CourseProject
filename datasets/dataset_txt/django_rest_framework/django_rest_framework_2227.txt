The nature of our tox and travis setup now appears to mean that some error cases such as PyPI timeouts are treated by travis as a test failure rather than a test run error.
For example see single "failing" test environment in this build: https://travis-ci.org/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/builds/42097529
That build should have been treated as an error rather than a failure.
Not obvious if this can easily be resolved.
