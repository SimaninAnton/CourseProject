Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Unknowingly make a mistake in one of your serializers.
Expected behavior
For DRF to tell you what field in what serializer lies the problem.
Actual behavior
It only tells you the problem, not where the problem is. For example the assertions made in Field.__init__. Setting a field to both read_only and read_write will result in the following error (stacktrace omitted):
AssertionError: May not set both `read_only` and `write_only`
The stacktrace does not help you with the problem as this these serializers are "dynamic" (for lack of a better term I guess). It would be much more useful if it were to add which ones were the problem:
AssertionError: May not set both `read_only` and `write_only` in MySerializer.my_field
Came across this error and I found it a bit frustrating to debug so I thought I'd report it here.
