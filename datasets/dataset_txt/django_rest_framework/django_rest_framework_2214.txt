I feel like I must be doing something stupid since this is all over the documentation, but it has never worked for me:
view = MyViewSet.as_view()
uri = reverse(...)
request = my_APIFactory.get(uri)
response = view(request)
This test (with zero-argument call to as_view()) always fails with the TB:
   def view(request, *args, **kwargs):
       self = cls(**initkwargs)
       # We also store the mapping of request methods to actions,
       # so that we can later set the action attribute.
       # eg. `self.action = 'list'` on an incoming GET request.
       self.action_map = actions

       # Bind methods to actions
       # This is the bit that's different to a standard view
>     for method, action in actions.items():
           handler = getattr(self, action)
E     AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'

eggs/djangorestframework-3.0.0-py3.4.egg/rest_framework/viewsets.py:70: AttributeError
I mean, this makes sense looking at the code: the actions argument defaults to None but gets no other value, and items() is eventually called on it. What am I missing? How can actions be optional?
