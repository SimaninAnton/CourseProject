Hi,
I'm getting 403 Forbidden - CSRF verification failed despite using TokenAuthentication, as can be seen from my settings below. This is happening for signup as well as login.
settings.py
ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email'
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'
REST_SESSION_LOGIN = False
REST_FRAMEWORK = {    
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ],
}
Is that a bug?
