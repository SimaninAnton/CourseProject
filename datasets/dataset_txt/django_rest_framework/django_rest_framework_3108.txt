Similar to Issue #162, I believe it is considered a best practice to namespace the templates directory of 3rd party libraries. For example django's admin is under django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/. This additional directory prevents the possibility of any collisions when looking up the templates by name.
Furthermore, it would be nice to offer some common override-able blocks in the default template. For example, if the template contained this:
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href='{% get_static_prefix %}djangorestframework/css/style.css'/>
    <title>{% block title %}Django REST framework{% endblock %} - {{ name }}</title>
</head>
...
Then a user can simply extend this template and set their own title in their template dir:
{% extends "djangorestframework/renderer.html" %}
{% block title %}My Site{% endblook%}
