So I have a Django model called Feed with a display_type field, instantiated with a choices tuple. I thought it would be simple to specify a serializer field for the implicit get_display_type_display() method as follows:
item_type = serializers.CharField(source='get_display_type_display')
However, this raises an exception because the attribute doesn't exist on the object at this point. obj.get_display_type_display is accessible in the debugger when I break inside a SerializerMethodField, however, which is peculiar. Is it because the method is curried? The signature starts <bound method Feed._curried....
It definitely seems that, in this case, Explicit Is Better Than Implicit! I got around it without needing a SerializerMethodField in the end, by simply throwing in a Feed.item_type property to proxy the method call. source='item_type' now works as expected.
