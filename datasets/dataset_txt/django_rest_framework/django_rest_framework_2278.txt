I was trying to use a custom message for the MethodNotAllowed exception and encountered an undocumented (but required) string placeholder. In other words, you need to have a %s in the detail string passed to the exception or it will raise an error for these two exceptions types.
I think the best way to address it would be to make the string formatter only apply to the default_detail and let the user specify a complete detail of their own.
