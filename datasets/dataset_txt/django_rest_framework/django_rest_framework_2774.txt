The docstring of serializers.BaseSerializer.get_fields() says:
    """
    Returns the complete set of fields for the object as a dict.

    This will be the set of any explicitly declared fields,
    plus the set of fields returned by get_default_fields().
    """
This is confusing because in actuality if fields are explicitly declared, these are the only fields returned, minus any fields in 'exclude'.
Would be good to clarify this in the docstring.
