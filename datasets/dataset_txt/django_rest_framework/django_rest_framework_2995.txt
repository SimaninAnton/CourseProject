The current implementation of BooleanField looks at the following options:
't', 'True', '1'
'f', 'False', '0'
When sending the JavaScript true and false in an XHR request, they will be interpreted, server-side, as the strings "true" and "false".
It doesn't cost anything to parse those too and spare some code digging to the next one who comes along. :-)
