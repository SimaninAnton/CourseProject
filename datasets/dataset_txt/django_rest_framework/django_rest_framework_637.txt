REST framework's Request class extends the standard HttpRequest, adding support for REST framework's flexible request parsing and request authentication.
Extend means inherits from,s o all methods of the base class, like get_full_path exist in the derived class. This is not the case with rest_framework.Request, we have a composition.
Write at http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/requests/#request-parsing that the access to the underlying HttpRequest object is available over Request._request .
