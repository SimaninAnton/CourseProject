Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a project with many applications/endpoint categories. It is front-end bug. I think the easiest way to test this is to create mock with endpoint categories. I have about 28 categories.
Expected behavior
Not all endpoints are visible. The last two applications are hidden under auntification, source code sections. This is perfectly clear if you compare the list to the desktop and mobile version.
Actual behavior
All endpoints must be visible.
