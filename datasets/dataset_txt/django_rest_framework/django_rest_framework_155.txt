I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
Allow labels to be specified optionally which is already a property of field. If user wants to return the field labels in place of field name, he/she should be able to configure so by setting it up in the extra_kwargs
Actual behavior
Currently, there is no such option to provide label in to_representation
