JSONParser uses json.loads and JSONRenderer uses json.dumps (though that is somewhat pluggable with .encoder_class).
In both cases, I wanted to swap out the implementation of json parser and serializer (sometimes to cjson, sometimes to a wrapper that still uses simplejson but with customizations beyond the encoding class).
It would be nice if calls to json methods were included in methods of these classes, so that the methods could be easily overridden. Alternatively, it would be nice to allow configuration of a dotted import path for the needed loads and dumps implementations.
