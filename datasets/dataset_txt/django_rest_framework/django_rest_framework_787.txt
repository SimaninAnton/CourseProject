I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
create an api view like so:
I tested this with cpython 2.7 on a macOS 10.12.4 :
from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals

from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['POST'])
def memory_leak(request):
    request_data = request.data
    return Response(request_data, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
and just curl against it with large json objects, testing with ps between calls:
echo '["'$(dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=10) '"]' | curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080 -d @-
and if you look at RSS in ps memory mostly just go up and never released
Expected behavior
rss memory will be released between requests and will go
Actual behavior
rss memory goes up and almost never released
