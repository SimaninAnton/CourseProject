request.build_absolute_uri() is used in e.g. SchemaGenerator.get_schema(), but this does not include the port being used.
This is bad when using e.g. the coreapi-cli client against a local runserver instance, where links cannot be resolved then.
While the port could be included on Django's side maybe, it might be better to use get_raw_uri() instead?!
