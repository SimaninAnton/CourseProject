I'm seeing duplicated validation errors being returned from a ModelSerializer for a model containing a GenericIPAddressField on Django 1.8.3 and Python 2.7.9.
{'address': [u'Enter a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.', u'Enter a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.']}
It looks like both the validator from the GenericIPAddressField and the validator from the DRF IPAddressField are being called.
