I cannot render a JSONField in binary mode (eg binary=True) with the default rest_framework.JSONRenderer. I get the following error: b'{}' is not JSON serializable
My environment is:
python: 3.4
drf: 3.3.2
My understanding is that the JSONField.to_representation method returns a bytes object (See here). But in python3, json.dumps does not seem to accept bytes.
I think this a bug, no?
