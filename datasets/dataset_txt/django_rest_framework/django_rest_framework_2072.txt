Add 1.8 alpha to the test matrix and resolve any issues.
The current builds against Django master indicate that there are some failures that will need resolving. It's unclear what's causing these. If they're not due to us using private Django API and they're not documented changes then it could also be valid to raise any upgrade issues 1.8 alpha presents as Django tickets.
