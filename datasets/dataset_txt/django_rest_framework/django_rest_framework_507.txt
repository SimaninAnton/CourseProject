DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES and DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES settings in the django setting REST_FRAMEWORK are not working after upgrading from 3.4.7 to 3.7.7
Steps to reproduce
Nothing is changed, after upgrade, these two settings no longer have any effect.
If permission_classes is set but authentication_classes not, permissions in permission_classes and DRF default authentication take effect.
If authentication_classes is set but permission_classes not, authentication in authentication_classes and DRF default permissions take effect.
If permission_classes and authentication_classes are set, everything is fine.
If permission_classes and authentication_classes are not set , all DRF default .
Expected behavior
DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES and DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES settings in the django setting REST_FRAMEWORK should work.
Actual behavior
DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES and DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES settings in the django setting REST_FRAMEWORK are not working.
