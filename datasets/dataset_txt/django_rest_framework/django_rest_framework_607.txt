I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a Serializer with a JSONField, and a View that uses it.
Using the browsable API, submit invalid JSON via the HTML form:
{
    "some": ["json"}
Screenshot:
Expected behavior
JSONBoundField shouldn't mangle invalid JSON.
Actual behavior
Form comes back with JSON escaped version of string:
"{\r\n    \"some\": [\"json\"}"
