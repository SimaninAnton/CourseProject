I add a boolean filter to my viewset using django_filters and if works only when uppercase booleans are passed like enabled=False and not enabled=false.
Isn't REST API supposed to be JSON-based?
This detail seem to leak pythonic nature of django-rest-framework.
Or maybe I miss some obvious way around this "feature"?
