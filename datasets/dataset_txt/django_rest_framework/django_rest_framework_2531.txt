In django 1.6 they added nice feature in django.forms.models.ModelFormsOptions. It allow to add Meta class with fields that overwrites params of fields, for example error_messages, so you don't have to specify every field but use:
class SomeSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
       model = SomeModel
       error_messages = { 'some_field_name': { 'required': 'This field is REALLY required'}}
It's quite useful to specify your own code errors, it would be nice to have it in ModelSerializer.
