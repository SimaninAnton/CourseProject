Since a Resource can be used in multiple views, it seems to me it would be better to use the Resource's docstring as a fallback rather than a replacement for the view's docstring.
From utils.description.get_description
# If this view has a resource that's been overridden, then use the resource's doctring
if getattr(view, 'resource', None) not in (None, Resource, FormResource, ModelResource):
    doc = view.resource.__doc__

# Otherwise use the view doctring
elif getattr(view, '__doc__', None):
    doc = view.__doc__

# I ain't got nuthin fo' ya
else:
    return ''
