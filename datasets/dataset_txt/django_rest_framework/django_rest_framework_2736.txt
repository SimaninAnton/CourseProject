Shouldn't django-rest-framework viewsets.ModelViewSet use serializers.ModelSerializer by default? It seems to be using HyperlinkedModelSerializer instead. It seems I need to create and specify a custom serializer just to get an ID output rather than a hyperlink. Is that the desired behaviour?
See this example https://gist.github.com/gabrielgrant/6431778
I think if this is, in fact, intended, it should at least be documented.
