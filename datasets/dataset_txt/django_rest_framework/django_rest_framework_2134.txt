I'm trying to add extra fields to a model class, but can't seem to find a good solution for now.
class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
   my_field = serializers.SerializerMethodField("get_my_field")
   def get_my_field(self, obj, field_name):
      print "not called"
   class Meta(object):
     fields = ("name",)
Is there a best practice for accomplishing this, without explicitly adding the fields to the Meta class's fields list?
