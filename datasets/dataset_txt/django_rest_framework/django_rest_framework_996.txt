Hi, Here is the doc to get_FOO_display
Having a model like this
class Person(models.Model):
    SHIRT_SIZES = (
        ('S', 'Small'),
        ('M', 'Medium'),
        ('L', 'Large'),
    )
    name = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    shirt_size = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=SHIRT_SIZES)
I could have a serializer field to get the shirt sizes name as :
shirtSizeName = serializers.CharField(source='get_ shirt_size_display', required=False, read_only=True)
Here is what I get with drf 3.5.x: <bound method Person._curried of < Person: Person object>>
it is working with drf 3.4.7 but not with django 3.5.x
django 1.10.2
