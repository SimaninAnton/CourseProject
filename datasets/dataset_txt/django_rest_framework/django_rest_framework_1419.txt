Hello,
I am having troubles creating a new obj into a legacy db.
This is the model:
class Contract(models.Model):
    idContract = models.AutoField(db_column='idContract',primary_key=True)  
    idClient = models.ForeignKey(Client, db_column='idClient',related_name='+') 

    class Meta:
        managed = False
        db_table = 'Contract'
        unique_together = (('idContract', 'idClient'),)
        default_permissions = ('add', 'change', 'delete', 'view')
When I try to create a contract pushing a post with content:
{"idClient": 1}
I receive:
HTTP 400 Bad Request
{
    "idContract": [
        "This field is required."
    ]
}
I have been woking with REST FRAMEWORK for 2 months and this is the only problem I was not able to solve, I need help. Thanks.
