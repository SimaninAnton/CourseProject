With reference to this query, I think it a widely requested feature.
I agree you can use the pk and maybe the hyperlink serializer , but having nested related models in request will be awesome and you can choose to override this behaviour based on request type i.e POST, PUT or GET.
Consider this:
Have all POST & PUT requests activate depth = 1
GET to set depth more that 1
Have a default to 0 if this override is not used.
Having flexibility and code reuse in serializers worths weight in gold.
