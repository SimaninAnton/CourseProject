The model serializer is defined as below
class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    product_info = serializers.JSONField(write_only=True, help_text='[{"id":1, "count":1},...]')
But the serializer can't get the product_info data use serializer.data in views and it shows:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
