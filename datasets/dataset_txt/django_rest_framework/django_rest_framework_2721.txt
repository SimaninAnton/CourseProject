I have a ModelSerializer that overrides validation for the 'slug' field on the model. Here's what it looks like:
https://dpaste.de/5tZgm/
Because I have to run some logic before I create the slug, I've created a validate_slug() field validator. I'm passing up from the client the string "!" as the value of slug.
As far as my understanding is correct, the field validation should take place before other validation. However, no matter what I try, this is the error I get:
{"slug": ["Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens."]}
This seems to be a Django model field error, which is something I was trying to override in the validate_slug() method.
This was working on 2.2.x until I upgraded today, and now it doesn't. If this is not a bug and I'm just doing things incorrectly, please let me know. Thank you!
