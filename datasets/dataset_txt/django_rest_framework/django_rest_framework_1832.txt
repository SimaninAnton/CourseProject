There are a number of times where I want the request serializer (ie used when sending data in a POST/PUT/PATCH) to be different from the serializer used in the response (GET and potentially responses to POST, etc).
For example, I create an object without nesting but when I GET the endpoint, related objects may be included in the response.
An example of this is GitHub's API for PRs, POSTing a PR has a minimal set of fields: https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#create-a-pull-request
but GETting that PR has far more fields: https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request
It would be great if DRF supported this type of functionality and did so in a declarative nature.
