Following all steps in Tutorial 2: Requests and Responses I've got following error trying to access 127.0.0.1:8000/snippets/
AssertionError at /snippets/
Cannot apply DjangoModelPermissions on a view that does not set .queryset or have a .get_queryset() method.
I fixed it by adding permission_classes into views.py
...
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes

@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
@permission_classes((AllowAny, ))
...

@api_view(['GET', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])
@permission_classes((AllowAny, ))
...
It would be great if you add it into tutorial.
