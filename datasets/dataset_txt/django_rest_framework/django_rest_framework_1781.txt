Is this really necessary:
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L882
            if value.endswith('+00:00'):
                value = value[:-6] + 'Z'
Writing a test took a while to figure out that DRF does this transforamtion while vanila Django doesn't, so asserting two string outputs were the same required tracing back to this utility and its change of +00:00 to Z for UTC.
