Booleans which default to false can be set to true by checking the browser form box; however, booleans which default to true are always true when created through the browser form, regardless of the state of the form checkbox.
I've created a small demo project for testing the behavior of boolean fields here.
Perhaps the best behavior might be to display a checked box by default for boolean fields which default to true, then set the field to false if the box is unchecked on the form.
