Currently we have our travis tests and our tox tests setup separately.
This can sometimes lead to minor differences in the two environments if they get out of sync, and it can be awkward updating package versions.
There are a number of posts from folks running tox from within travis, but doing so in a way that each environment still runs separately (rather than one giant tox run of everything)
It also looks like we'd be able to run the linting and any other separate steps (eg coverage) more easily this way around.

Not super high priority, but it does seem like it'd be a nicer style?
