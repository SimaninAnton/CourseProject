lookup_kwarg was added at in dc45bc7, that allowed you to get an object based on a different kwarg than the lookup_field. This was useful for cases where having the kwarg match the lookup_field does not make sense (too generic) or where it needs to be consistent across your appplication.
In the merge for that branch (835d3f8), lookup_kwargs was dropped. I can't find the commit that it was dropped in, or any reason for why it was done.
This is probably related to django/#20342, but that was eventually closed.
