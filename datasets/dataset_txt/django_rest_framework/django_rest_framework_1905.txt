I am trying to call a class baed view from another class based view using This SO post. I called a class baed view by passing in the request like MyClassBasedView.as_view()(request). When I tried to access the HTTPRequest from request, I had to access it like request._request._request, instead of request._request. I checked the code in views.py and it is converting the incoming request to Request without checking the instance of request. I managed it by using MyClassBasedView.as_view()(request._request)
This is my first reporting of an issue. Please be gentle if I violated any guideline.
