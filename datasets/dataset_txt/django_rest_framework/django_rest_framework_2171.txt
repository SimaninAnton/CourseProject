I'm having an object with a min and a max field, which I need to validate on a class level. However, several methods don't work. I tried:
adding the method validate(self, data) in the serializer, raising an exception directly
adding a new class with _ _ call_ _ that raises the same exception, adding it as a validator in Meta
Field level validators work. The issue appears both at editing with PUT and creating with POST.
