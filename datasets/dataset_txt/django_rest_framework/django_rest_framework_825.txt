Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce

Expected behavior
I was hoping to get a live example of the new interactive API documentation in 3.6. Instead I just upgraded one of the simpler apps I had my computer. Is this the end result of the rest-tutorial? If so that's already been upgraded to 3.5, just not deployed it seems.
Actual behavior
Using DRF 3.1
