I'm setting this argument on my model but it appears the ModelSerializer ignores it. I've printed out the serializer in the Django shell and it doesn't list upload_to in the arguments to my FileField. When I run my app, It just sets the path to the MEDIA_ROOT in my settings file. I've also tried setting the upload_to to a function and I've verified with pdb that it doesn't get called. The Serializer FileField documentation doesn't mention upload_to, but since it is part of core Django I assumed it was supported.
