We need to add the quickstart app to the settings.
Settings
We'd also like to set a few global settings. We'd like to turn on pagination, and we want our API to only be accessible to admin users. The settings module will be in tutorial/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'tutorial.quickstart', # <--- add this line
)

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': ('rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser',),
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10
}
