I have two models with a many-to-one relationship, and I set up viewset for both models. While I was trying to view them via browser, the first model works correctly, but the second model hang there infinitely, and finally led the server to be crashed. I figured out this only happens if I tried to create or update model, and strangely, when I tried to do the same actions on admin site or postman, everything worked correctly.
I guess there might be an issue with the browsable API; anyone knows how to fix it?
Thanks a lot.
