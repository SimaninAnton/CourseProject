For example if I have countries and states and I want to send:
country=USA and state=HI
and have them deserialized using something like:
state = State.objects.get(country='USA', state='HI')
Right now the solution is to introduce a new slug field to the model, call it state_country_slug and then use:
state = serializers.SlugRelatedField(slug_field='state_country_slug')
This requires adding a new field to the model, seeming unnecessarily.
