I am hitting a bug on CharFields that contain the choices kwarg. It seems the bit of code that converts the serializer field to a form field is missing an entry when the serializer field is explicitly set to choice field. So there are a few issues here:
It is incorrectly checking for the choices kwarg and selecting forms.ChoiceField as the form field.
If the serializer sets the field to a ChoiceField, it also fails because the entry in the lookup table is missing.
I'm using Django 1.4.2.
