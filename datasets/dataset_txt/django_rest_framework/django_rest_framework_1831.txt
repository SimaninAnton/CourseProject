The class class MultipleOf: doesn't inherit from object.
This is a little confusing to people new to python. I think it would be worth documenting the syntax for inheriting from "old-style" python classes.
MultipleOf.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
instead of
super(<ClassName>, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
