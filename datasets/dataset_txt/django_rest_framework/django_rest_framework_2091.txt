With 3.1's new pagination API the initial styles will be PageNumberPagination and LimitOffsetPagination.
We should also add an CursorPagination that uses cursor based pagination for use with very large data sets, where indexing into the result set is infeasible.
However, let's not let this block the 3.1 release - we'll slate this for 3.2 instead.
