Using a ModelSerializer with some CharField which have blank=True set (but not null=True), the serializer fields will be generated as required=False.
If the client does include None for one of those fields, the serializer will successfully validate, passing None for that field, which will results in a 500 Integrity Error, Column 'xxx' cannot be null.
Char type fields should probably default to coercing None inputs to the blank string (perhaps unless a allow_none flag is explicitly set).
