I have a class named Object that has a "parent" field that points to another Object. At the root of my hierarchy is a root Object that is its own parent. django-rest-framework does not detect the reference loop, hence it is not usable for Object...
[edit: I should have said, is not usable in its default configuration...must be tweaked in order to be used. Which is not that big a deal, but I figured I'd mention this.]
