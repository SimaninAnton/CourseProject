There are a lot of really long methods that should be refactored so that they are made up of many smaller methods. This will make the code easier to read through when debugging projects that depend on Django Rest Framework, and can also help prevent bugs from being introduced here.
One particularly gory example is serializers.get_fields, which is like 150 lines long.
