I have a strange behavior when I call the DELETE method.
The api didnâ€™t return the right status code = _204_
The browsable API display the correct status "_HTTP 204 No Content_"
HTTP 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json
Allow: GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
Vary: Accept
However, we can read the status code _200_ in apache logs
"DELETE /accounts/drf_dev/ HTTP/1.1" 200
I got this issue with APITestCase client.delete() and curl --request DELETE.
Did I miss something with the status codes?
