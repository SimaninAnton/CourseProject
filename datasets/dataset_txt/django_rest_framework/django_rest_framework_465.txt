Many times users use search per column in a data table, for example:
the current SearchFilter is not usefull that case because it perform search over all allowed fields in the view, in this case - there is need to allow the user choose the fields he would like to search for
The query should look like that:
?search__name=a&search__age=1
The query should support a nested query
