The website restframework.herokuapp.com, linked from the main page of this project's website, is a great example of the framework's browseable API feature, but it's using an older version of the framework (v3.1) and doesn't show off the built-in docs feature that arrived with v3.6.
Are there any public live examples of the built-in docs? I would really like to be able to point manager-types to a live example/s, preferably associated with an established business' published API/s.
