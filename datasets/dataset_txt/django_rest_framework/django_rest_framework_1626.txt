The clickable links in the browsable API depend on there being a space between the colon and the quotation mark in the JSON response. The following response will yield clickable links in the browsable API:
{
    "id": "1",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1/",
    "username": "JockeTF"
}
However, the following response will not:
{
    "id":"1",
    "url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1/",
    "username":"JockeTF"
}
This becomes inconvenient when using a JSON library that does not include the space, such as UltraJSON. A custom JSON renderer can be used to to demonstrate this issue:
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer

class CustomJSONRenderer(JSONRenderer):
    def render(self, data, accepted_media_type=None, renderer_context=None):
        ret = super().render(data, accepted_media_type, renderer_context)
        ret = ret.replace(b'": "', b'":"')
        return ret
