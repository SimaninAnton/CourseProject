I've started a new app and installed drf=3.3.1. Whenever an exception is raised, I'm redirected to the original request's URL and I can't see the exception even though DEBUG=True
The last version where it behaves as expected is 3.2.5, starting from 3.3.0 it doesn't work anymore. Is that a possible regression and a problem with an exception handler?
