After finishing tutorial 1-3 smoothly, I followed the tutorial (http://django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions.html) and finished sections up to "Adding endpoints for our User models".
(In other words, adding "url(r'^users/$', views.UserList.as_view()),
url(r'^users/(?P[0-9]+)/$', views.UserInstance.as_view())," was done.)
Because I would like to test as early as I could, I ran the server with the command of "python manage.py runserver", pointed my browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/ and got the following error message:
NameError at /users/
name 'User' is not defined
Request Method: GET
Request URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/
Django Version: 1.4.3
Exception Type: NameError
Exception Value: name 'User' is not defined
Exception Location: /home/user/tutorial/snippets/serializers.py in Meta, line 14
I was not sure my workaround was right or not.
After I added
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
to serializers.py and views.py,
modified the import in views.py
from snippets.models import Snippet -> from snippets.models import *
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer -> from snippets.serializers import *, 
the problem solved.
Another suggestion, if the files (e.g serializers.py and views.py) to be modified mentioned explicitly in the document, it is clearer.
