If I have a model with a property defined that is used by serializer
class MyModel(Model):
    @property
    def value(self):
        return object().a

class MyModelSerializer(Serializer):
    value = serializers.JSONField(read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ('value',)
then exception is swallowed by internal DRF code which make debugging much harder.
It seems that offending code is here:
django-rest-framework/rest_framework/fields.py
Line 454 in a628a2d
 except (KeyError, AttributeError) as exc: 
Please, use a different technique to detect existence of an attribute for a serialized instance.
