Converting Decimal to float is hasardous because floats internal representation can have more decimal than expected in the model.
For exemple the model field price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=20, decimal_places=2) and the following decimal Decimal('874662070036053953.96') will fail like this:
{'price': ['Ensure that there are no more than 2 decimal places.']}
