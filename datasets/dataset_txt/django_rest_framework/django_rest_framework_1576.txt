I updated my code base to use version 3.2.3 now my previously passing tests are now failing.
It seems to be related to Line: 105 in filters.py.
My view utilizes the module rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter; however the request that is failing is a PUT request without any search fields.
It seems that Commit b4b2dc removes the conditional preventing falsely search_fields from entering into the for loop.
Additional information can be provided upon request.
