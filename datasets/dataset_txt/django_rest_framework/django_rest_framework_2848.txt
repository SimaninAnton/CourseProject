Hi,
Just working through the tutorial, and can't seem to reproduce this section: https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions.md#object-level-permissions
"Now, if you open a browser again, you find that the 'DELETE' and 'PUT' actions only appear on a snippet instance endpoint if you're logged in as the same user that created the code snippet."
The UI shows the actions, however when clicking you do get a 403 / "You do not have permission to perform this action." message.
Highly likely I've missed something!
Thanks very much,
James
