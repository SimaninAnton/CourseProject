No matter what type of Field you use, you always get this error when setting read_only=True:
AssertionError: Field(read_only=True) should be ReadOnlyField
I'm using djangorestframework version 3.1.1, I also tried on 3.0.0 and had the same error.
Specifically, I'm using a HyperlinkedRelatedField when having this error.
