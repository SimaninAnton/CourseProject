I tried out the REST framework tutorial and have the problem, that the the pre_save method in the snippet view never gets called:
https://github.com/markotibold/rest-framework-tutorial/blob/master/snippets/views.py
Here #409 you write that the pre_save function doesn't get called by APIView. Does that mean the tutorial is wrong or outdated or do I mix something up?
Many thanks.
