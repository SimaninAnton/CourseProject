I think we should probably slim the CONTRIBUTING.md text right down to 2-5 key points.
Something like:
Usage questions should be directed to the discussion group.
Narrow issues down to the the most minimal possible reproducing case before raising them.
There's other possible stuff, but those are probably the two most critical points. The less we say, the more weight what we do say should have.
We can also link to the longer form contribution guidelines.
