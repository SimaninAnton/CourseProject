In this file, there is the text:
Now update the urls.py file slightly, to append a set of format_suffix_patterns in addition to the existing URLs.
With the code:
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns

urlpatterns = patterns('snippets.views',
    url(r'^snippets/$', 'snippet_list'),
    url(r'^snippets/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)$', 'snippet_detail'),
)

urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(urlpatterns)
I believe urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns... should be urlpatterns += format_suffix_patterns..., otherwise we'd be overwriting the existing urlpatterns instead of appending to them.
