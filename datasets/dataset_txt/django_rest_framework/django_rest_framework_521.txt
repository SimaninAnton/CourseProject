This is a suggestion more than a bug. I would like it if each section of the generated API documentation can have a description as well as each link in the section.
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
I was working on creating API documentation, and found no way to document a model or a viewset in a general sense, without having the same description on every endpoint. I tried this, expecting the main description to render before each endpoints's heading.
class MyModelListView(viewsets.ModelViewSet): 
    """
    This is a description of what MyModel is.

    read:
    Get a MyModel by id

    list:
    Get a list of available MyModels
    """
    http_method_names = ['get', 'list', 'head']
    queryset = MyModel.objects.order_by('id')
    serializer_class = serializers.MyModelSerializer
Expected behavior
This is the result I was looking for
Actual behavior
No description shows up.
I examined the template, hoping to find a way to make this show up, but I don't have enough understanding of the schema generators to get this done. Is this possible?
