Unless I am wrong here, it seems like the GET method should support forms like PUT, POST etc.
For example. I have an API that allows searching, this is relevant only to the GET method. As such, I would like for API users to see a form on the HTML view, so that they have a place to put keywords.
If the GET method section of renderer.html included a form with method="GET", it could also render the available formats as a drop-down or radio set.
I think this would do a lot to explicitly display what input is available when making GET requests.
