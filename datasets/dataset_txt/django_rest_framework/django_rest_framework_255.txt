One of the things that was a bit confusing as a someone new to DRF was around schemas / CoreAPI. Following the tutorial, there was no mention of OpenAPI being roadmap forward and CoreAPI being effectively deprecated in the long term (related to core-api/core-api#58).
From https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/3.9-announcement/#whats-next
We're planning to iteratively work towards OpenAPI becoming the standard schema representation. This will mean that the coreapi dependency will gradually become removed, and we'll instead generate the schema directly, rather than building a CoreAPI Document object.
The schemas api-doc section does mention OpenAPI:
renderers.OpenAPIRenderer - Renders into YAML-based OpenAPI, the most widely used API schema format.
But the tutorial page doesn't mention OpenAPI. Would it be helpful if that page mentioned OpenAPI as the widely used "standard" so new users aren't led down the path of using CoreAPI directly for new projects?
