Hi,
I'm wondering if there is a good reason why returning a dictionary from the view is not supported. DRF returns Expected a Response, HttpResponseorHttpStreamingResponse to be returned from the view, but received a <type 'dict'>.
It would be super useful for unittesting, send a dummy request in, get back a dict.
