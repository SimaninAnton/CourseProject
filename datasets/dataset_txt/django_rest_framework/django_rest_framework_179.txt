I'm using DRF and to return response, I used Response() which located at from rest_framework.response import Response
To make custom response, first, I copied all of the source to custom file.
And in my views, I changed Response() to my own file.
But when I running django server and access via web, it through errors.
AssertionError: .accepted_renderer not set on Response
I just copied original Repsonse() and re-use it.
Why it occur errors?
Purpose of custom response is I want to add more argument that something likes cursor for pagination.
As you know that in original Response, takes 6 arguments.
def __init__(self, data=None, status=None,
             template_name=None, headers=None,
             exception=False, content_type=None):
And return it in def rendered_content(self), line of ret = renderer.render(self.data, accepted_media_type, context)
So my scenario is, add cursor to init and pass through it to renderer.render().
Any problem with my way?
Thanks.
