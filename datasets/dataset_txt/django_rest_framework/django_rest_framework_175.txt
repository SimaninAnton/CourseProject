#6532 is focusing first on the generateschema command. This will enable a static schema that will be built using apistar for the docs.
For dynamic schema's (e.g. where model choice fields are used) we need two things:
A version (or adjustment) of SchemaView that will generate the schema on demand.
Instantiate generator.
Call get_schema()
Render to response.
Integration with apistar. Is it just a JS endpoint to fetch the schema? Do we also serve the static files? Etc. @tomchristie to advise on this part as we get nearer.
