This bug was found by someone using two DRF-based packages in conjunction: django-rest-registration and django-rest-framework-simplejwt, see below:
apragacz/django-rest-registration#36
The bug was fixed in django-rest-registration but the original issue in DRF may still cause problems.
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Install django-rest-framework-simplejwt
Add JWTAuthentication to REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES']:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ),
}
Create a Django check which imports directly or indirectly rest_registration.schemas
Start the server (./manage.py runserver) or just run the checks (./manage.py check)
Expected behavior
module gets imported without any problems.
Actual behavior
AppRegistryNotReady is being raised.
