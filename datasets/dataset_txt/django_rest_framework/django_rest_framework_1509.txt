The documentation topic, documenting your api describes overriding the metadata view method as described in the version 3.0 updates notes. However since commit f4b1dcb I think this method has been changed to options.
Here is a patch:

 You can modify the response behavior to `OPTIONS` requests by overriding the `metadata` view method.  For example:

-    def metadata(self, request):
+    def options(self, request):
         """
         Don't include the view description in OPTIONS responses.
         """
-        data = super(ExampleView, self).metadata(request)
+        data = super(ExampleView, self).options(request)
         data.pop('description')
         return data
