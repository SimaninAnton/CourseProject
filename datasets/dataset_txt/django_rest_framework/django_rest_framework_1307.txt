Hello!
Made from this thread.
Suggested changes:
new attributes in models.Token fields verbose_name=_("label")
new Meta-options verbose_name & verbose_name_plural
Labels in AuthTokenSerializer fields in case of usages in Brousable API
provide AppConfig class as described in django documentation with verbose_name came through ugettext_lazy
