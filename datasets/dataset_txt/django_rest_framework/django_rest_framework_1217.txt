Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
The website for the DRF 2.x docs is down, which should be here: http://www.tomchristie.com/rest-framework-2-docs/
The site was working fine about 1-2 weeks ago. Perhaps the registrar was recently changed, and/or DNS records need to be updated?
Some links to the broken site can be found here: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/, and at the top of the README for this repo. At the very least, it would be nice to remove these links, or explain why the site no longer exists.
Expected behavior
The site should take us to the docs for DRF version 2.x
Actual behavior
The site is down.
Note:
I am in the process of upgrading from DRF 2.3 to DRF 3.x, so the DRF version 2 docs are helpful in this process. Hopefully I won't need them much longer! But I imagine others may need the link to the version 2.x docs as well, so it would be nice to keep them around.
