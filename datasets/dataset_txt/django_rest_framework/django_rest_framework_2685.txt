45d4622 added a weird workaround for a problem that has nothing to do with the BaseSerializer but is tailor made for the Django ORM.
I'm trying to use DRF with elasticutils' search querysets and been wondering why the serializer always returns ALL results, instead of the ones I told the paginator to return. The all method returns all objects, no matter what filter or query has been done before.
As to how to fix this, I would propose that this code needs to live in the ModelSerializer.field_to_native method not in its parent class. That would help non-Django ORM uses greatly.
