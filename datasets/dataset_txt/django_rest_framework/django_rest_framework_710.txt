I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
I'd like to propose that a setting LIST_SERIALIZER_CLASS that overrides the list serializer that ModelSerializer makes use of. Currently we can set the list_serializer_class property on the serializer Meta however if you have a standard serializer for your entire site then it would be nice to set this globally. Thankyou! :)
