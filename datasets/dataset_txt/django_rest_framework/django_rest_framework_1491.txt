n Chrome 45.0.2454.101, the DRF 2.x docs fail to load properly. The pages are served from:
https://tomchristie.github.io/rest-framework-2-docs/...
but the CSS is from http://..., and chrome blocks the mixed-mode content.
This causes the pages to be unstyled and a bit harder to use.
Hopefully it's a simple thing to regenerate to use //tomchristie... or https://tomchristie... ?
