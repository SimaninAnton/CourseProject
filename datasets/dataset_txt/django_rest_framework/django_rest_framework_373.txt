Steps to reproduce
The documentation says: "The HyperlinkedModelSerializer has the following differences from ModelSerializer:
It does not include the id field by default."
The problem ModelSerializer does not include id bt default either.

Expected behavior
The sentence: "It does not include the id field by default." should be removed.
Actual behavior
It's on the official documentation. Here: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/5-relationships-and-hyperlinked-apis/
