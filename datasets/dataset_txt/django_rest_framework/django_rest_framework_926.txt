I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
I apologize if I get it wrong but if view attribute filter_backends is empty then elements list variable cannot be populated. However there is only check on the presence of filter_backends attribute not that it is not empty. Thus the view.get_queryset() is called unnecesarilly which can cause perfomance issues if get_queryset is not trivial.
