The status codes inside the status module that are not prefixed with "HTTP_(num)" need to be removed.
It's not clear how big the backward incompatibiliy is. It might break client code. Though that would be easily fixed, it's not nice.
What if we give a deprecation warning and drop them in the next major release?
