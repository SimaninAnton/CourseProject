Something is going wrong with how this line (299 in the md file)
https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blame/master/docs/api-guide/fields.md#L299
is being rendered when output as HTML here
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/#date-and-time-fields
That header has become mangled. Not sure about the nature of the problem since the markdown seems to render fine when viewed via Github.
