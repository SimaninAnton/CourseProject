I propose to change the serializer part and explain, that it is only necessary if you need more control and that, in the case of the quickstart guide, it is used to only display certain fields (and hide fields like date_joined and last_logon).
It's not necessarly required for easy models, e. g. like:
class Dish(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name
Currently it looks like it is required and I find that confusing. That might clear up things.
