I see:
Allow: GET, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
even though I am not logged in and have:
permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, )
If I remove: mixins.UpdateModelMixin, then the list is reduced to:
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
which shows that the list is aware of the supported methods on the endpoint.
My hope was to use this list in my downstream UI.
