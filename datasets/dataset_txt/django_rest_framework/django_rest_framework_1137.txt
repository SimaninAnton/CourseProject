I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Define a POST view to use FileUploadParser
Use curl to upload a 100 byte text/plain file.
The line 149 in parsers.py is buggy. It is expecting a return value from handle_raw_input. MemoryFileUploadHandler::handle_raw_input() doesn't return anything. Django FileUploadHandler::handle_raw_input() doesn't return any value.
Expected behavior
Handle the uploaded file
Actual behavior
Throws the following error
FileUpload parse error - none of upload handlers can handle the stream
