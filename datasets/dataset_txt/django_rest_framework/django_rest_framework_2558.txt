I may be doing something wrong, but have a custom HyperlinkedRelatedField field with a get_url() function looking like this (nothing unusual):
    def get_url(self, obj, view_name, request, format):
        return reverse(view_name, args=[obj.id, obj.parent_id],
                       request=request, format=format)
This works fine under normal circumstances, but when one of users tried to use format suffix pattern by appending ".json" to URI, the reverse() call broke with Django's Don't mix *args and **kwargs in call to reverse()!. It's obvious what went wrong looking at the code, but not obvious (to me) what the fix should be. My workaround is to always use kwargs only in rest_framework.reverse.reverse(), but I guess it's not a great solution.
Will try to work on a test/fix, but can't promise anything given my current workload.
