I want to allow anonymous access to my API for development purposes, therefore I have set:
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
    'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny'
],
My Ajax POST request works when I don't have a django user logged in:
[21/Nov/2013 14:28:23] "POST /api/device/register/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2
But when someone is logged in, the browser will show a popup and ask for credentials:
WARNING Forbidden (CSRF token missing or incorrect.): /api/device/register/
[21/Nov/2013 14:26:22] "POST /api/device/register/ HTTP/1.1" 401 59
I would expect AllowAny to not care about if there is a session or not, am I wrong?
