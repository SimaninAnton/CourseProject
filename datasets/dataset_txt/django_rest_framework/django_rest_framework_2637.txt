I have a set of ViewSets needing the common endpoints move_up and move_down.
These work fine with the @link() decorator if an exact copy of the methods are placed in each of the ViewSets.
If I define a mixin class - MovableObjectViewSetMixin and put the decorated methods there and add this mixin to my ViewSets then the endpoints are no longer found.
