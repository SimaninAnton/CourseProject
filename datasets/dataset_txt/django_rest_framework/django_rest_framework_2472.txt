Hello,
rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle stores data using Django's caching framework, and uses the X-Forwarded-For header in it's cache key. When running Django behind Apache with mod_proxy, however, the X-Forwarded-For header can contain spaces. See the Wikipedia page. This is probably fine with some cache backends, however Memcahced does not allow using spaces in cache keys.
