Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
I'm using Angularjs as frontend and Django-REST-API as service layer.
I launched Testing by using Django StaticLiveServerTestCase which will run the server at port 8081
When I use Selenium to simulate user behaviour to make POST request to test server, it caused server 500 error
Expected behavior
The data I POST to Server should be saved in Database
Actual behavior
The POST request was blocked
