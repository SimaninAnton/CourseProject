Even though my viewset methods have IsAuthenticated argument as permission_classes, I will receive server errors in the context of AnonymousUser object has not attribute ...
I've put ipdb inside has_permission method of IsAuthenticated and noticed that it never gets. It will be called if i put it inside has_permission method of AllowAny class.
