We should outline our project managment processes.
To help contributors see what they need to do to become maintainers.
In order to help current and future maintainers.
In order to codify everything and ensure transparency.
In order to demonstrate the increasing bus-factor of the project and show that we've moving towards long-term stability.
In particular we should document our policy on selecting and renewing the maintenance team, see #2190. And our release process, see #2233.
