I found a bug in rest_framework/templatetags/rest_framework.py:urlize_quoted_links. If you try for serialize following dict you will get "Invalid IPv6 URL" exception:
 { "a": "asdf:[/p]zxcv.com" }
The problem is in string asdf:[/p]zxcv.com which is treated as potential URL. Only last part of this string can be converted into URL, if you add space into this string everything will be OK asdf:[/p] zxcv.com
I'm using djangorestframework==2.3.9
