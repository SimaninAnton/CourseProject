Hello,
In 3.0
I have a model serializer and the model have required ManyToMany fields.
When I'm sending data as application/json it's validating that some of the ManyToMany fields aren't present and it throws the correct errors.
But when I send them using multipart/form-data it's not validating the ManyToMany fields. It would actually create the object without any ManyToMany fields.
Not sure if this behavior is intended or not.
