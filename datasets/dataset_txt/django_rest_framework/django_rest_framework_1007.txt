In writing unit tests (and possibly in other situations) it is nice to be able to build a new instance of a Django model without saving the instance.
In the case of unit tests, it slows down tests to have to interact with the database for tests of model serializer functionality when there is already other test coverage of the model's persistence behavior either via direct tests on the model or via full-stack tests.
It would be nice it DRF's ModelSerializer had methods to just build (and possibly also just modify) model instances without persisting and have those methods be called by the .create() and .update() methods to perform those parts of their work.
