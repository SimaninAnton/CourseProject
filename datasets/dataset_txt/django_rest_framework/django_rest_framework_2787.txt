This might be more a question than an issue I think.
Right now Token is link AUTH_USER_MODEL, this seems to be a problem when we have several type of users inside your Django application like Agent, Manager, Admin.
All the users type (ie Agent, Manager, Admin) have a different model which are class base on AbstractBaseUser and on all of them I will need to create a Token and be able to authenticate with TokenAuthentication.
What would be the best practice in this scenario?
