I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
GenericAPIView says
You'll need to either set these attributes,
or override get_queryset()/get_serializer_class().
But in the method get_valid_fields of the OrderingFilter class, it gets the serializer_class like so
serializer_class = getattr(view, 'serializer_class')
I believe it should be
serializer_class = view.get_serializer_class()
