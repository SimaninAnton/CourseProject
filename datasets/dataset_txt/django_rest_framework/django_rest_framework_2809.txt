When creating/updating a resource using XML where a field has a max_length, DRFs validator calculates the length of the string including the CDATA tags, though it saves the string without them.
From what I can tell looking at the code, a fix would be another try... except block for casting the value to a non cdata wrapped string in the xml parser's _type_convert() function. Does this seem right to you?
I am not on my own laptop at the moment so I can't really do much digging, I was wondering if there are any potential repercussions to doing it at this point in the flow?
