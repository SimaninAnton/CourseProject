Calling a restapi endpoint with:
a querystring, causes BaseSerializer.from_native being called with a QueryDict.
a body of application/json, causes BaseSerializer.from_native being called with a dict.
While this might not be a problem most of the times, but when it comes to a RelatedField with many=True, calling getlist for getting all of the values can offer some bad surprises...
Wondering if there is an easy fix for this.. (E.g.: adding a JsonDict type, which has a getlist wrapping scalars into a list or something, and wrapping return value of JSONParser.parse into it)
