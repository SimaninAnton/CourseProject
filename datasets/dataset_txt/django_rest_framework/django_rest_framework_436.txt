Moved to issue as requested by @xordoquy in PR #5908
@xordoquy the docs specifically say otherwise
Validation errors are handled slightly differently, and will include the field names as the keys in the response. If the validation error was not specific to a particular field then it will use the "non_field_errors" key, or whatever string value has been set for the NON_FIELD_ERRORS_KEY setting.
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/exceptions/
I expected ValidationError("it borked") to return a dict keyed on NON_FIELD_ERRORS_KEY.
