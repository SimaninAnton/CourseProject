Hi, I'm a big fan of Django Django REST framework and really excited to upgrade to newest version, but there's an issue...
I figured out that after upgrade to Django Django REST framework 3.0.2, API Docs (Django REST Swagger) don't work anymore.
When I open /docs/api-docs/api , I see that an exception has been thrown:
Exception Type: AssertionError
Exception Value: 'LabelViewSet' should either include a serializer_class attribute, or override the get_serializer_class() method.
Exception Location: /home/max/.virtualenvs/nlp-rest/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/generics.py in get_serializer_class, line 189
Django Version: 1.7.1
Django REST Swagger Version: 0.2.6
Python Version: 2.7.6
