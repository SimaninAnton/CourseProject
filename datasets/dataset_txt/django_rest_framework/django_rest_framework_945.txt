http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/foo/ will generate a 404 page that is broken:
the links point to ./api-guide/ and ./tutorial/, so they will point to the wrong thing
the CSS and JS files are similarly linked to, so they won't work either.
As a side note, I think for api-guide/ stuff, stripping .html might be worthwile, as they used to have it, you can find links to http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers.html that'd work just fine if you removed the .html.
