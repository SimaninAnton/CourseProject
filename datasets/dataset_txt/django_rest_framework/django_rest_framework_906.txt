Right now, the metadata does not include choices for a ChoiceField if it is read-only. This can be a problem if, for example, I want to use the metadata to display human-readable text instead of a number. See this line in the code.
It looks like this behaviour is actually unintentional. The check for read_only was added in a97c989, with the commit message 'fix read_only related field metadata.' But later in 014e24b and 05b0c2a, related fields were specifically excluded anyway. It appears that if just the check for read_only is removed, the test in a97c989 will still pass.
