Hi. I am having trouble doing a PUT to a (many=True) PrimaryKeyRelatedField(). When I PUT a single pk, everything works fine, but when I PUT multiple (ex. myfield:[1,2,3]), an empty value is returned with a status 200
The same happens for a SlugRelatedField().
I am aware that nested relations are read-only, but the docs seem to suggest that this should work (http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations.html#primarykeyrelatedfield).
