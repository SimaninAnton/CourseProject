As per discussion on IRC with @tomchristie and chibisov/drf-extensions#70, the current popping out of the url_path kwarg does not work for downstream packages that reuse the same viewset for constructing nested routes. The reason for that is get_routes() being called multiple times (our router only calls it once) for each subsequent nested route, and therefore only the first route will know that url_path argument was set.
P.S. As an adhoc example solution, popping back in url_path if it diverges from the method name on subsequent routes.
