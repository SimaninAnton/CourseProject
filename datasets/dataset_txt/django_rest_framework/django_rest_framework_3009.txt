Currently, the coupling between ModelFields and serializer Fields is somewhat brittle.
As @tomchristie suggested, we should actually be mimicking the post_clean() behavior from Django's ModelForms.
That way there would be no need to couple every possible ModelField to a serializer Field because all the necessary validation logic is already present on the model.
This bit where max_length is added to the kwargs could then also be dropped.
