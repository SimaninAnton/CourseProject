Steps to reproduce
Build an API view that supports "GET" actions (list, retrieve).
Expected behavior
Fields information presented in some form in the schema Document.
Actual behavior
Generator doesn't even do introspection if the method isn't one of PUT, PATCH or POST
Reasoning
Information about return objects can be used (e.g. with swagger-codegen) to generate client libraries for languages and tools that support type-checking. Also, it would be nice to see "an example" object in the documentation like the included docs view or Swagger UI.
