I'd like the option to return a 400 when an unrecognized parameter is given to a serializer.
This can be implemented by modifying BaseSerializer.restore_fields. I suggest a serializer then have two class attributes defining whether to enforce this (default being a backwards-compatible no) and any attributes to ignore.
For example:
class MySerializer(Serializer):

    fail_on_unknown_parameters = True
    unknown_parameters_whitelist = ("api_key", )

    name = CharField()
Is this acceptable to the project from a design perspective?
