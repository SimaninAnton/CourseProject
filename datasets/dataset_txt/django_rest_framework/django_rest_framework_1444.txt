When attempting to find out how to disable pagination for a specific view, a quick google search returns the Read the Docs documentation with out of date instructions at http://djangorestframework.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api-guide/pagination/. This page states:
Note that using a paginate_by value of None will turn off pagination for the view.
However this is no longer the case. As far as I can tell, this documentation may no longer be supported given the documentation available on the DRF homepage and the fact it is no longer linked to from GitHub - but this is non-obvious when arriving on that page. Additionally there are no instructions for disabling pagination for a particular view in the DRF homepage documentation.
If it is the case that this documentation is no longer supported, I promose a clear statement is placed at the top of the page stating this with a link directly to the currently maintained documentation. Additionally instructions on disabling pagination for a particular view should be added to the DRF homepage documentation on the Filtering page (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/).
Cheers,
