Django's TemplateView assigns the view object to the template context. Some applications and libraries rely on this fact to provide useful functionality (in my case, django-parler's get_translated_url template tag).
DRF's TemplateHTMLRenderer does not do this, and as far as I see, it does not provide a hook to pass extra context to the template from the view.
I propose to assign the view to the template context in TemplateHTMLRenderer.render(). This seems to be a trivial change: the view is already in the local scope via the renderer context.
In addition, do you think it would be a good idea to provide a way to pass extra context to the template when using TemplateHTMLRenderer?
