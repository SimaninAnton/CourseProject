First of all, I am quite new to Django and installed your framework today. I love to dive into new things, rather than study them beforehand. Learning by doing.
Having this said, I found it quite difficult to understand the content of the installation example (IE) and the quickstart (QS).
The IE uses the very basic way to provide a working API. I used this to implement your framework. Later I dived into the QS, which let me quite confused because the approach is very different. (This is related to #1127.)
From a beginners point-of-view I would suggest to quickly take up the IE code and explain that you can enhance it to have more control over the way the framework handles models. State that the serialiser is used to hide certain fields. Explain the differences of the view sets. Also state that for simple things, the IE code is fine. (It works for most of my purposes and it's nice to keep it slim.)
I would even dare to propose to have both in the quickstart and make two chapters: basic or simple and something like quickstart with more control.
Just throwing this thought out in the open. I believe it could help beginners like me to dive into your framework.
