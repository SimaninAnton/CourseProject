In the documentation, it clearly states that all errors returned due to validation errors should have a "detail" error message. However, when my UserSerializer (a vanilla serializer over the standard django User model) doesn't validate (for example not a valid email message) I only get the field errors. For example:
{"username":["This field may not be blank."],"password":["This field may not be blank."]}
It would be nice if "detail" was always included, so I can show this to the user, without knowing specifically which fields to look for validation errors in.
