I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework. (Commit 71ad99e)
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Register a viewset with the name data to a router. (router.register('data', SomeViewSet))
Navigate to the generated API docs page (as included by include_docs_urls())
See a minimal test repo here: https://github.com/akx/drf-docs-fail
Expected behavior
The docs work as usual.
Actual behavior
Docs crash with
AttributeError: 'Link' object has no attribute 'links'
in djangorestframework/rest_framework/templatetags/rest_framework.py
/ schema_links, line 253
Workaround
Don't name a viewset data.
(However, this isn't an acceptable workaround in my project, since the viewset literally concerns bits of data, and any other name would be worse.)
