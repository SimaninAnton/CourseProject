Django version 1.9.2
Rest framework version 3.3.2:
I'm testing my API in the rest framework backend on localhost using http://localhost:8000/api/v1/my-model/ in my browser. If I try to create a new instance of my model via a HTML Form POST , I'm getting the following CSRF Error:
{
    "detail": "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect."
}
But if I'm using the Raw data way it works fine. Just getting validation errors as expected. I couldn't find any misconfiguration or something.
