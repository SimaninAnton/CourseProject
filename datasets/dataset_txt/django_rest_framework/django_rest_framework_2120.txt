This is the bug that I originally reported in #2262 -- if you have a ModelSerializer with a field in Meta that doesn't map to a property or model field, serializer.data fails silently in 3.0.2, and returns no value. For example, if 'bad_field' doesn't map to anything you'll see.
class MyModelSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ('good_field', 'bad_field')
My bad, I should have reported two separate issues earlier.
