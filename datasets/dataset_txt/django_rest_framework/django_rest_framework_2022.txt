I recently tried to upgrade my 2.4.x djangorestframework installation to 3.x. I experienced many, many problems - more than I'd like to share in this issue. I tried finding resolutions for them to the release notes of 3.x (or elsewhere on the net) but didn't find anything. I lost more than an hour of my time and as a result I just lost my confidence and got back to 2.4!
I think that you either need to expllicitly say somewhere Don't upgrade from 2.x to 3.x, just create from scratch all your serializers, viewsets, permissions etc or mention everything that has been changed and is no longer working.
I know that by changing the major version number you can do whatever breaking changes you want, however I feel that you need to think of your users also - don't torture us!
(really sorry for the ranting)
