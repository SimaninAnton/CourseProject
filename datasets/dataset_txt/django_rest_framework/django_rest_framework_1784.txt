I'm trying to get a many to many model to update when I save a related model. This should be possible using the m2m_changed signal (and it works with django itself but not through REST framework)
I'm on Django==1.8.2 and djangorestframework==3.1.2
This seemed to be fixed for the admin portion of django through
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/16073 (symptoms)
and
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6707 (actual bug)
I tried with the API browser and cURL, same results.
Most of the steps to reproduce the problem are explained into the above links. Let me know if you need more info...
