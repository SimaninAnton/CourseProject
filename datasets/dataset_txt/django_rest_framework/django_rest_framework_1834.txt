From the docs on generic views under examples, there is mention of support for passing a model keyword arg to as_view() like:
url(r'^/users/', ListCreateAPIView.as_view(model=User), name='user-list')
However, that situation results in:
ListCreateAPIView() received an invalid keyword 'model'. as_view only accepts arguments that are already attributes of the class
Is this behavior still supported on 3.x or is a doc fix needed here?
