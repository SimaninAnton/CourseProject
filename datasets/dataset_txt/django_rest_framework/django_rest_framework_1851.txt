Looking over the DRF serialization code, I notice that run_validation() for fields will throw a SkipField exception for empty values when doing a partial update.
Currently, there's no capability to raise a SkipField exception for serializers. To recreate this behaviour one needs to copy some of the validation code from Field.run_validation() into the nested serializer.
Would adding SkipField exceptions to Serialier.run_validation() be worthwhile? If not perhaps add a note to the documentation on the best way to do this?
