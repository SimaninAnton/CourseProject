utils.representation.serializer_repr calls Serializer.fields, which is lazily evaluated. This is in turn called by Serializer.__repr__. So a simple print statement can cause data to be calculated.
This isn't great, but may not be itself a bug. I'm running into something slightly different - a nested serializer appears to not be having fields called on it at all. If I print the field, it shows up nested in the response; if I don't print it, it does not. This is my own programming error, but it was very hard to track down, and I thought I should bring this up.
