In the new "Built-in interactive API documentation", using the "Interact" forms, how can I force the response to be rendered as JSON instead of rendered as Django page, since my default renderer_class is BrowsableAPIRenderer (comes in first in the DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES list, and the JSONRenderer is second). In other words, how can I make the Interact form to include format=json in the request.
Steps to reproduce
# settings.py
'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
    'rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer',
    'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
),
In the new interactive API documentation:
click on "Interact"
fill the form
the reponse is a Django renderer HTML
Expected behavior
I should be able to force a JSON response, through a renderer setting or by passing format=json to the Interact request.
