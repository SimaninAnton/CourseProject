I'm attempting to use HTMLFormRenderer to render a form for one of my serializers. This is deliberate, as i'm trying to create a solution to render nested serializers.
so in a TemplateView, in the get_context_data() method, I have something like:
hfr = HTMLFormRenderer()
s = serializers.MySerializer()
context['my_form_html'] = hfr.render(s, renderer_context={'request': self.request})
in my template I have something like
{{ my_form_html|safe }}
The form gets rendered with apprpriate types of input fields and even the choice lists get populated.
unfortunately none of the field names are recognized. as a result all the input ids, the labels, etc all say "None:"
is this a bug or am i doing something stupid here?
