When passing an email address such as firstname+lastname@domain.com to EmailField in the admin browser, it returns firstname+lastname@domain.com, which is consistent with Django's forms.EmailField.
But when using the command line, EmailFied returns firstname lastname@domain.com.
It seems an issue with serializers.CharField which is subclassed by serializers.EmailField, as using serializers.CharField also replaces + with a space.
This is can be especially problematic if using email for authentication, because Django accepts email with + as valid yet DRF does not through the command line.
