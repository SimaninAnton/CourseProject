I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I've often come across the case where I would like to use one serializer to serve a model to users with various access levels to that model. For some users I'd like to hide some of the fields, and the first simple solution I can think of would be to add an optional hidden argument to the base serializer field that would simply have the effect of excluding that field on read (and maybe forcing the default on write). It would also be reasonable to allow a list of functions like the validators argument to increase flexibility.
This could be achieved with a custom field, but it would be a backwards compatible change that I think could be widely used and having it as a core argument to every serializer seems cleaner to me.
