Steps to reproduce
Override get_serializer_class for any view that inherits from GenericAPIView and attempt to access the request attribute when using the new SchemaGenerator, or going through DefaultRouter.
Expected behavior
The request attribute is passed into SchemaGenerator initialisation and subsequent methods have access to it.
Actual behavior
AttributeError: '<view-name>' object has no attribute 'request'
