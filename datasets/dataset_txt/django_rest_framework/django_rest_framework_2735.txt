I would like to migrate the templates in django-rest-framework to correspond to updates in Bootstrap 3. I did this for a personal site some months ago before Bootstrap 3 was released, and I am now in the process of updating those changes to 3.0.0. When ready, I would like to publish those changes so that it will be useful for others as well.
Is there some interest in this? I will submit a pull request if there is.
