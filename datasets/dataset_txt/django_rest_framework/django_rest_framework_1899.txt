If I define the DEFAULT_VERSION of my API, this value does not appear on response header.
Example:
# request
curl -I -H "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1/endpoint/
# response
...
Content-Type: application/json
...
But, if I send the version
# request
curl -I -H "Accept: application/json; version=2" http://127.0.0.1/endpoint/
bash
# response
...
Content-Type: application/json; version=2
...
Shouldn't the default version always be in the response?
