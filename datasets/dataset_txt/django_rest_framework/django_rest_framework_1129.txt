Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Deploy your django project on a subpath with a proxy and make sure to set the SCRIPT_NAME header.
Expected behavior
Urls in the schema to be using the URLs with the SCRIPT_NAME prepended.
Actual behavior
URLs without the SCRIPT_NAME making the Django REST Swagger UI unusable, since its calling to the wrong URLs.
