After profiling our system I noticed that calling reverse appears to be very expensive. To see how it affects performance I disabled all our URL fields. Below I show the average request times Before and After disabling the URL fields. Type shows how expensive the request is, and Count the number of requests that were made. All requests are list requests using the JSON format.
Type Count Before After Speedup
Heavy 100 x 401 ms 259 ms 52 %
Middle 250 x 170 ms 107 ms 59 %
Simple 750 x 034 ms 022 ms 54 %
The system I'm working on has a URL field for every relation, and uses namespace versioning.
