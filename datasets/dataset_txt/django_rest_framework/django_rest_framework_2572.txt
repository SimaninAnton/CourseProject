I am new to DRF and it's amazingly helpful .. and the API guides are great but I needed (and I think I am not alone) API detailed reference so that I can browse every detail about classes and their methods and attr, args , output data object in different available formats (json,xml,yaml, ... etc)
and also API examples reference .. usage example for every single class, method, attr, decorator, .... every thing
I think this will need community help with big contributors to suggest example snippets
