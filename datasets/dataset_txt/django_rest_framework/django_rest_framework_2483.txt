It's not a DRF issue.
But strictly related for those who'd like to use the out of the box Oauth2.
The original django-oauth2-provider has some issues with Django 1.7.
It still use minetype that is no more supported by Django 1.7
This guy posted a solution that worked for me: caffeinehit/django-oauth2-provider#84
But no one from @caffeinehit seems took in charge this issue.
Plus when I make an authentication it do not create and do not give me back the "refresh_token". Maybe I'm missing something or maybe this is another bug using Django 1.7
Thanks for your help and your great work!
