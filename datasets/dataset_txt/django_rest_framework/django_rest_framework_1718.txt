I've read through the doc about permissions but couldn't figure out how to implement field level permission. I have a model like:
class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    content = models.TextField()
    owner = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
    status = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
What I'm trying to achieve is: administrator users should be able to modify all fields of the model while normal users can only modify the status field. How should this be done?
