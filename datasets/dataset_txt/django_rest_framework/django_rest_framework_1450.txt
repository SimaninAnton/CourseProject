@tomchristie I'm helping mentor a team and noticed our lead django engineer was using APITestCase instead of TestCase and I wanted to ask when you would consider this a good use case. "back in my day" we didn't have or use this api so I'm curious about it's value-add /etc
I tried to do my homework by reading over the history/commits about this but it's still less /(un) clear for a "hobbyist" django developer like myself :)
