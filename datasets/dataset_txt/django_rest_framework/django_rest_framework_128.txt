Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Set up a view
Add post and get methods
Expected behavior
I can override generated List, Retrieve, or Create actions on a per-method basis
Actual behavior
I'm stuck with the generated names
Use case
I have a login endpoint that redirects users to an external SSO service. For legacy reasons, this must support GET and POST requests. When the OpenAPI schema is generated (with rest_framework.schemas.openapi.AutoSchema), I end up with two operations on the same path (less than ideal, but acceptable) and non-sensical actions (bad). I'd like to instead have the operation IDs GetLogin and PostLogin.
