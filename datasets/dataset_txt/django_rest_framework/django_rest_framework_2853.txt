On the page "Tutorial 4: Authentication & Permissions" in the "Updating our serializer" chapter: Right after instructing the student to add an "owner" field to the serializer, it says:
Note: Make sure you also add 'owner', to the list of fields in the inner Meta class.
However, in the previous tutorial pages, a meta class for the serializer was never defined and the code for the serializer on the 1st page of the tutorial does not contain a meta class either.
I assume that this meta class here should be added to the serializer (and explained) on the 1st tutorial page:
class Meta:
    model = Snippet
    fields = ('pk', 'title', 'code', 'linenos', 'language', 'style')
Then, on page 4, we can say that the 'owner' field should be added "to the Serializer's meta class".
