Hi.
I've an use case where ModelSerializer should display nested reversed relation if depth attribute set or PK if not set.
ModelSerializer should have following feature:
class MySerializer(ModelSerializer):
  class Meta:
    include_reversed_fields = True
    # OR
    reversed_fields = ('myfield',)
ModelSerializer would then display reversed relation fields normally through PrimaryKeyRelatedField and ManyPrimaryKeyRelatedField or through ModelSerializer if depth is set like it does with any forward relation field.
Currently I've subclassed ManyRelatedField and it always renders related fields as nested even if depth is not set. Feels a bit dirty...
Any opinions?
