The HTML anchors in the documentation aren't working when there is a forward slash in the anchor name. An example of this is the "PrimaryKeyRelatedField / ManyPrimaryKeyRelatedField" section in the serializer fields page. This is certainly a problem in Chrome and I expect it will be in other browsers as well.
Fixing this is probably a case of chaining another replace into mkdocs.py but since I can't get the docs to build I don't want to commit this blind and break something.
