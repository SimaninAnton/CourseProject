I see that people missing the trailing . in the quickstart documentation has already arisen: 1ba8220#diff-306f5e40924dc731960189d645f34641, but I think the problem could also be css-related!
I noticed that the trailing dot appears to have the same hex value as comments and confirmed in developer tools that this is the case (they're both #93a1a1) and believe this is because that single character is wrapped in the wrong span class (pun rather than pln).
Frontend is not my strong suit, so while I'd like to fix this small matter without bothering y'all, I couldn't parse why it's happening. My guess after a cursory review of this prettify script is that you're typically assigning styles to punctuation programmatically, but that this is an edge case.
I hope I didn't miss this already being an issue! I searched all open issues for the associated hex code, "pun" and "punctuation," but did not find one.
