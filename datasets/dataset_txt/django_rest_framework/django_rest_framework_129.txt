Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Put cls.view = MyViewSet.as_view(actions={"post": "some_action"}, detail=True) in a test class's setUpClass method.
Run self.view(self.request, pk=self.some_object.id) in a test.
Expected behavior
It should work identically to self.view = MyViewSet.as_view(actions={"post": "some_action"}, detail=True) in a test class's setUp method.
Actual behavior
I get the following error message:
AssertionError: The request argument must be an instance of django.http.HttpRequest, not [package name].[test class name].
Creating the view in the setUp method works just fine.
Details
Based on a bit of debugging the view field is created differently. When initialized in setUpClass, self.view ends up being <bound method MyViewSet of <[package name].[test class name] testMethod=[method name]>>, but when created in setUp it is <function MyViewSet at 0x7f0a5515ac80>.
