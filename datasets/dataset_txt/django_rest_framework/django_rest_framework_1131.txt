I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
UseSearchFilter with serializer that has related field to RelatedModel
Set search_fields = ('related_model__field', 'my_field')
Expected behavior
Correct filtering
Actual behavior
Raises "RelatedModel" has no field named 'my_field'
I will submit pull request that fix this error. It is caused by overwriting opts in SearchField.must_call_distinct
