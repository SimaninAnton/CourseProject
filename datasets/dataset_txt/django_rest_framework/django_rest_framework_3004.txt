We had an error like that in a model's serializer =>
{"a1": ["Invalid pk 'None' - object does not exist."], "b1": ["Invalid pk 'None' - object does not exist."], "c1": ["Invalid pk 'None' - object does not exist."]}
But both 3 foreign key fields are null true, blank true.
If we define these fields as blank=true in model's serializer class then it causes trouble as saving null neither there is a value nor not.
Any idea how to solve this problem?
Thanks for help.
