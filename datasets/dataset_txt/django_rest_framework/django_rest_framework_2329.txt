I have a serializer that looks the the following:
class ReportSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    person = serializers.SlugRelatedField(slug_field='uuid')
which is causing an N +1 select issue because select_related is not being used to pre-query the Person object. This means that in order to serialize the person field when serializing a Report, each Person must be queried for its uuid.
We likely want to use select_related on all SlugRelatedField and likely all nested serializers somewhere like here: https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/e437520217e20d500d641b95482d49484b1f24a7/rest_framework/serializers.py#L570
