I was wondering why my requests generated by APIRequestFactory weren't calling the parser or containing a .data attribute. I may be missing something, but it seems like this test code should pass:
from rest_framework import test, request
req_factory = test.APIRequestFactory()
putreq = req_factory.put(
      '/some/url',
      b'some data',
      content_type='text/plain'
)
self.assertIsInstance(putreq, request.Request)
Instead it gets this:
AssertionError: <WSGIRequest: PUT '/some/url'> is not an instance of <class 'rest_framework.request.Request'>
Why isn't it?
