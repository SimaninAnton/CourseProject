If I have a result set containing 5 items and a page size of 10, then there's only 1 actual page of results. If you request page 2, they get back a 200 response with an empty result set. If you request page 600, you get back a 200 response with an empty result set (and previous page URL is set to page 599).
This is pretty forgiving behavior, and I think it's okay as a default or option. However, it would be nice to have the option (built-in) to instead respond with a 400 bad request and indicate that the requested page of results does not exist.
