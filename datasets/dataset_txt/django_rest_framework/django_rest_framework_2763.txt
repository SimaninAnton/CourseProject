Hi, I've just noticed a small problem in the get_default_fields methods of the ModelSerializer : line 694 :
        assert field_name in ret, \
            "Noexistant field '%s' specified in `read_only_fields` " \
            "on serializer '%s'." % \
            (self.__class__.__name__, field_name)
As you may see directly, the arguments are inverted, which leads to rather funny error messages :-)
