I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
I'm using:
coreapi==2.3.0
djangorestframework==3.6.2
Configure the docs as per the announcement.
Browse to the docs /docs and open the dev tools of your browser.
See that there is a failed request for /static/rest_framework/js/coreapi-0.0.20.js
I've taken a look in the rest_framework/static/s directory and can only see coreapi-0.1.0.js
Expected behavior
Either coreapi-0.0.20.js be included or the front be updated to use coreapi-0.1.0.js.
Actual behavior
Error retrieving coreapi-0.0.20.js
This script tag is actually included part-way through the body and coreapi-0.1.0.js is correctly included in the header. Not sure if this helps, but here is a snippet of the HTML:
<pre class="highlight python hide" data-language="python"><code># Install the Python client library
$ pip install coreapi</code></pre>
    
<pre class="highlight javascript hide" data-language="javascript"><code><!-- Load the JavaScript client library -->
<script src="/static/rest_framework/js/coreapi-0.0.20.js"></script>
<script src="/docs/schema.js"></script></code></pre>
