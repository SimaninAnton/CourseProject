EDIT: Update title from 'HTML List View Post Bug' - @tomchristie
Given a model like:
class Test(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=40, primary_key=True)    
    description = models.CharField(max_length=80, blank=True)    

    def __unicode__(self):        
        return self.name
Serializing a list view to the HTML viewer provides a post form at the bottom that allows for creation of a new object; however, the primary key field is not displayed.
(I'll try to create a test case to highlight this behaviour, but wanted to get the bug in more quickly as it'll take me a bit to sort out the test env.)
