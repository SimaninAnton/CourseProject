get_view_description(html=True) with markdown installed is broken if the project uses tabs instead of spaces. Everything after the first line is rendered as a <pre> block.
The problem is in the utils.formatting.dedent() function which only dedents spaces, not tabs.
Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
from rest_framework.utils.formatting import dedent
dedent("\tfirst string\n\n\tsecond string")
Expected behavior
It returns:
u'first string\n\n\tsecond string'
Actual behavior
It should return:
u'first string\n\nsecond string'
