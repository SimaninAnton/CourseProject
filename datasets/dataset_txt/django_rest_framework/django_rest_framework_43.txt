I currently have Coreapi in DRF 3.10.1 and it seems to be having some performance issues.
django-auth-ldap==2.0.0
django-crispy-forms==1.7.2
django-dbbackup==3.2.0
django-extensions==2.0.7
django-filter==2.2.0
django-queryset-csv==1.0.1
djangorestframework==3.10.1
djangorestframework-filters==1.0.0.dev0
django-redis
dnspython
gevent
gunicorn[gevent]
requests
pyaml
python-ldap
py-dateutil
psycopg2
coreapi
When I include the API documentation it seems to take over 15 seconds for the page to load.
url(r'^api/docs/', include_docs_urls(title='API Documentation', schema_url='/', public=False)),
Are there any other performance issues that others have noticed?
