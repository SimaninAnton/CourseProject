I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create array field with base_field provided choices:
class A(Model):
 field = ArrayField(base_field=CharField(max_length=256, choices=(1,2,3)))
Expected behavior
properties: {field: {
 type: array
 items: {
  enum: [1, 2, 3]
  type: "string"
 }
}}
or
properties: {field: {
 type: array
 items: {
  enum: [1, 2, 3]
 }
}}
Actual behavior
properties: {
field: {
 type: array
 items: {
  type: null
 }
}}
Note
Looks like choice field processing produces {enum}

But list field expects type (self._map_field(field.child).get('type'))
