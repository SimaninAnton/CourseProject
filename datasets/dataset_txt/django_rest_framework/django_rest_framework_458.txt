Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a JSONField on a serializer
Submit {"a": "test"} to the field through docs
Breakpoint at the return of JSONField.to_internal_value()
Expected behavior
The returned data is a dictionary with a single key a that has a value which is string test.
Actual behavior
The returned data is the string {"a": "test"}
