I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create A, B and C models. A has foreign keys to B and C. B and C both have millions of entries. Access the API UI for model A. Even without any data, the UI will take huge time to load, has it is populating the dropdowns for choosing the foreign keys with all instances of B and C.
Expected behavior
Load immediately. Possibly use an asynchronous search when choosing a value for the foreign keys over the respective models.
Actual behavior
Loading the UI for the model in the API takes huge amount of time.
