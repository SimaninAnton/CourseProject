Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Add some simple DRF urls but namespaced, like:
url(r'^api/', include('api.urls', namespace='api'))
Expected behavior
When using HyperlinkedModelSerializer, I would expect for url namespace to be handled automatically.
Actual behavior
HyperlinkedModelSerializer is building the related url without namespace. The url is simply built from model name (%(model_name)s-detail). In this way, a namespaced url can't be resolved.
