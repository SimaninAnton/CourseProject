When the username is valid but the password isn't 400 is a bit strong, 401 is far more appropriate.
400 (Bad request) - "The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax"
401 (Unauthorised) - "If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials."
