See the weird behavior here: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23475
My analysis of the situation:
In the traceback, I see the the request object disappears and then reappears in the traceback. It looks like it's being stored in field.context.
Fields objects are shared between requests, right? and context holds request-specific information right? That's not thread-safe.
