I am currently on drf 3.0
I am running into an issue where when I am trying to PATCH a field on a model with a ManyToManyField, the model serializer produces a deserialization where the related many to many relation gets removed, even though the field payload does not include the many to many field. Is this intended behavior? or am I configuring this incorrectly?
