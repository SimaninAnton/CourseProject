The ObtainAuthToken class starts as follows:
class ObtainAuthToken(APIView):
    throttle_classes = ()
This prevents it from using throttling if configured project-wide. I believe this is not a good practice. Throttling the authentication system is essential to prevent brute-force attacks.
I know I could create a new class that extends that one and use it for my specific purposes, but i believe that removing the throttle_classes parameter from the class would be a more intuitive solution and benefit the project.
Also aligned with my argument, I couldn't find nothing in the documentation stating that ObtainAuthToken doesn't comply with the project-wide throttling configurations.
