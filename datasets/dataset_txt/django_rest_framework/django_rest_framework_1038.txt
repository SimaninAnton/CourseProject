I have two models related to each other via a ManyToMany field. I defined a ModelSerializer for one of the models and a custom RelatedField for the second model. I defined both to_internal_value() and to_representation() for the custom field and expected the serializer to use it to do read-write operations. I got a ValueError because somewhere along the way the original field name for the ManyToMany field got replaced by lower case version of the model it linked to.
I posted the code and the error in this stackoverflow question. Seems like this is a genuine issue where an important piece of data gets dropped in processing.
