Is there any interest in formally supporting the JSON PATCH specification? Partial updates over PUT or POST are not, as far as I can tell, an agreed-upon way to use HTTP verbs in the context of a RESTful API.
PUT probably shouldn't use partial updates because it's supposed to be idempotent and one could argue that a partial update over PUT cannot be idempotent. I think you could make the argument for partial update over POST but typically it seems that that's done over specific endpoints (i.e. POST /assets/123/email). As such, it looks like it's best to use PATCH for partial updates and adhere to the spec laid out in the RFC. I don't love the PATCH specification but it does seem like the best option, given the alternatives.
Should I build a pull request for this or would it be better suited as a separate, third-party repository?

Examples:
[
    { "op": "test", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "foo" },
    { "op": "remove", "path": "/a/b/c" },
    { "op": "add", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": [ "foo", "bar" ] },
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": 42 },
    { "op": "move", "from": "/a/b/c", "path": "/a/b/d" },
    { "op": "copy", "from": "/a/b/d", "path": "/a/b/e" }
