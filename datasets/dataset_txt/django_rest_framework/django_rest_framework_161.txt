Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
class ChildSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    parent_id = PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=models.Parent.objects.all())
    class Meta:
        model = models.Child
        fields = ('id', 'parent_id')
        read_only_fields = ('id',)
Expected behavior
It works (I'm able to create a database record).
Actual behavior
TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'ModelTwo'
And AFAICS, I'm not the first who doesn't expect it to convert id to model instance. Can you explain your reasoning? Doesn't it make sense to incorporate the fix from the other issue?
