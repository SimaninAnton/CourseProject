I m using filters.DjangoFilterBackend & filter_fields
filter_backends = (filters.SearchFilter,filters.DjangoFilterBackend,)
filter_fields = ('ip','hostname')
in serializers.py ,I used ModelSerializer
I changed one fieldip from charfield to GenericIPAddressField , and the filter forip does not work anymore
