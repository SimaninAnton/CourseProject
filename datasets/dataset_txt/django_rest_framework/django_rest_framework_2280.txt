I just tried updating to 2.4.4 from 2.3.13 and started seeing a RelatedObjectDoesNotExist error in one of my model's save methods. The DRF POST API modifies request.DATA to add the request.user ID for a required field in the model. It seems in 2.4.4 the user id doesn't make it through to the model save method. Here's the overridden 'create' method from my DRF class:
def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    # add required fields for the user and status
    request.DATA['request_user'] = request.user.id
    request.DATA['status'] = 'Pending'
    response = super(ProcessRequestList, self).create(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return response
This worked fine in 2.3.13, can anyone else confirm this? I just checked 2.4.2 and it looks like it has the same problem. I'm using Django 1.7 btw.
