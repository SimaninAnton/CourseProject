I feel like I must be missing something obvious, because the instructions seem simple.
I've addded 'provider' and 'provider.oauth2' to installed apps, included the oauth urls, and done syncdb.
I set up a client via the admin, and then I make the request for the access_token via:
http://localhost:8888/oauth2/access_token/ which returns
{
  "scope" : "read",
  "refresh_token" : "4857dad48b0c08104cecbea81b6637c25d9adc6f",
  "access_token" : "06955f9411ce3401c6865705ac179ad80d37f4b4",
  "expires_in" : 31535999
}
So it seems like everything is working so far. But then when I make a request for a protected resource with the Authorization header and token (like so):
http://localhost:8888/snippets/3/
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Bearer 06955f9411ce3401c6865705ac179ad80d37f4b4
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
I get this response:
{
  "detail" : "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
Any idea what's going on?
