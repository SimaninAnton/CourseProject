If you have a TimeField and set the value to time(0, 0) it is serializeing to None, most likely as a result of this commit: fc08236
time(0, 0) evaluates to falsey, yet it is a perfectly valid time value. Given why that change was made (to handle string values) I believe the check should explicltly be
if value is None or value == '':
    return None
