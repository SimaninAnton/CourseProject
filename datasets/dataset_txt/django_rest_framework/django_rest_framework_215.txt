Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
Proposed docs change
Hi!
In Django 2.1, as part of adding null support to BooleanField, the previously implicit/hardcoded blank=True of BooleanField was removed:
django/django@5fa4f40#diff-bf776a3b8e5dbfac2432015825ef8afeL995
This means that d-r-f serializer BooleanFields are no longer generated with a required=False on the field. (Which in our case meant new This field is required validation errors in our tests from cases where our API was using PUT when it really should have been using PATCH.)
So the mention here needs updating (ideally to mention the behaviour changed in Django 2.1, since these docs were one of the places I looked at when trying to figure out why tests were failing post Django 2.1 upgrade):
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blame/0e10d32fb122619a7977909536b642d09603192a/docs/api-guide/fields.md#L127
I've also filed a Django ticket since this change isn't mentioned in the Django 2.1 release notes or on the fields docs page:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30216
Many thanks :-)
