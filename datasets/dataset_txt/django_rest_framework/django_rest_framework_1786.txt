When unique_together is declared in the Django model, the validator will try and use that as a validator for a class. However, this validator might be missing information that is requiered, but won't be entered until the perform_create, e.g.
def perform_create(self,serializer):
    serializer.save(author=self.request.user.profile)
but when you have a requirement in the Django model,
class Meta:
    unique_together ('post','author')
then you get an error:
{'author':"['This field is required']"},
because perform_create hasn't been run when that particular validator runs.
