Hello,
I have a db model containing:
action = models.CharField(max_length=4, null=True, blank=True, choices=PHOTO_ACTION, db_index=True)
ModelSerializer I believe turns this into a ChoiceField.
Unfortunately the choice list doesn't list an appropriate value to correspond with None.
I have tried setting required=False, but it has no affect.
Thanks.
