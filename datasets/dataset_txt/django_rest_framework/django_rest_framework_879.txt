I have been looking for a great way to document our entire platform along with our API documentation. It would be really nice if there was some sort of way to integrate plain old documentation in the docs that aren't tied to any specific endpoint. The other feature of this is to be able to show or hide sections of the documentation based on the user's permissions.
I'd be willing to contribute it with help of someone on the drf team to point me in the right direction and this is a good fit into the project.
