In the example located here http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/#example is generating and url of "group-names" for the @detail_route decorated function group_names. However, when done in code underscores aren't converted to dashes for @detail_route decorated functions. i.e.
@detail_route()
def sales_history(self, request, pk):
    pass
generates
/sales_history
