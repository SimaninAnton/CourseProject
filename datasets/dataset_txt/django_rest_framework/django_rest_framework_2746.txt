The regular expression that Default Router is using for pk is (?P<pk>[^/]+)
This can become a problem when trailing_slash=False because then it become (?P<pk>[^/]+)\.(?P<format>[a-z]+) and format parameter is consumed in pk instead of format
In fact this seems to me that Default Router is not usable with trailing_slash=False. Is this a bug?
Is there a way to change pk regular expression?
I prefer to use (?P<pk>[0-9]+)
