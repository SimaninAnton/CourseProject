I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
View the docs site (eg, https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/)
Click one of the links on the left nav-bar
Expected behaviour
Page is scrolled to the clicked location
Actual behaviour
Page is redirected to the root url (https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
The documentation generator seems to be appending ../ to the relative tag-href
eg: <a href="../../#reversing-action-urls">Reversing action URLs</a>
