Hi,
what do you think about allowing to send page_size=max query parameter? In this case if max_paginate_by is defined, then pagination will be performed by that value. If it isn't then paginate_by will be used.
I have an use-case when clients want to take as much paginated data as possible, but they don't want to know about backend limitation. With page_size=max approach i could change this value on backend and client would't bother about limitations.
I can implement it as mixin for my own usage and want to know, is it suitable to be in core?
