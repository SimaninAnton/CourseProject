Hi,
NB: This is related to this post - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-rest-framework/2iEat5mCbvY/oVUBgIgoVCUJ
I have Cart and CartItem models (https://gist.github.com/victorhooi/6349172), serializers (https://gist.github.com/victorhooi/6349183) and views (https://gist.github.com/victorhooi/6349186).
I've set required=False on CartSerializer.cartitems.
When I attempt to POST to create a new Cart with no items, I get:
TypeError at /api/v1/carts/
add() argument after * must be a sequence, not NoneType
(Full stacktrace at https://gist.github.com/victorhooi/6349211).
I do know that nested writes doesn't work with DRF, however, I would have thought that since the FK to Cart is on CartItem, and I've set required=False, that this should work?
Cheers,
Victor
