This may not be a "core" requirement but it will be very useful. Currently, the users (specifically myself) have to create a SerializerMethodField for each field they wish to return the choice text for (using get_FOO_display).
I suggest adding an optional argument to ChoiceField init method (i.e get_display) defaulting to False, that when set to True will update the field_to_native to return the required value
