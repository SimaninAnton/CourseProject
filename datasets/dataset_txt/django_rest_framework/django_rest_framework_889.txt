Hello,
latly DRF provided "code" params to every exception. Despite this the response looks like this:
class LoginSerializer(Serializer):
    username = serializers.CharField()
POST /login
400: {'username': ['This field may not be blank.']}
Where is a parameter "code" with value "blank"? The same with a generic exceptions:
GET /profile
401: {'detail': "Authentication credentials were not provided."}
Where is a parameter "code" with value "not_authenticated"? source
Thank you.
