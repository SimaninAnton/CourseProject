Hi,
It would be great if the depth field as well is dynamically adjustable! This would make it easy for the nesting level to change, depending on the request data coming in.
This is especially useful for applications which have some degree of offline-online synchronization, and want to sometimes update all related fields in one single request.
I have already implemented this, and will send you a pull request in a moment.
Best regards,
Samir.
