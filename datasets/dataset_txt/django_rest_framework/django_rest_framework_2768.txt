I have the following renderer stack:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.renderers.TemplateHTMLRenderer',
        'rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer',
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    )
}
Let's say I have a view which doesn't have a template_name assigned. Quite expectedly, trying to open it makes TemplateHTMLRenderer spit out a nice TemplateDoesNotExist exception, and fail.
What I consider unexpected behavior, however, is the fact that, if I open that same URL with a ?format=api, I still get the same error, even though BrowsableAPIRenderer doesn't need the missing template.
