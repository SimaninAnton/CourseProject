Just like django admin model, wouldn't it be good to add request param in GenericAPIView.get_queryset function. This allow greater flexibility when user override get_queryset in custom ViewSet.
For example, there is Limitations of object level permissions!, it would be cool to override get_queryset function and apply appropriate filter. Although, now we can override ListModelMixin.list function. I think former is much more cool
