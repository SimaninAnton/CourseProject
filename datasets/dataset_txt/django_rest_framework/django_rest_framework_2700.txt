Hi! I'm trying to make a feed resource that depends on the user model so I have the url:
/api/v1/users/{pk}/feed
I think the right way to get this is adding a new action with @link decorator inside the user ViewSet. The problem is to generate the documentation... It's pointing that the feed output corresponds to a user model... but it's not. I know I can change the model for the serializer but I don't have a model for the feed... actually it should be built and parsed by a custom serializer. There is a way to make this, I'm doing it wrong or I'm proposing a new feature?
Thanks!!
