I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
Should display docs, when visiting /docs/
Actual behavior
Error in template documentation/sidebar.html, 'dict' object has no attribute 'data'
It looks like the document is not being generated with data, also document.links is missing.
