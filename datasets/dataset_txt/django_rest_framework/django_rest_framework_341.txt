Hi @rpkilby @tomchristie @xordoquy
I am using Django rest framework in my project . I am facing an issue on timezone . Django server time is different from local time.
Que 1: How to detect automatically time from customer end , they may have different time zones i cannot hardcode that, will it automatically detect time and date ?
Que 2: Can i make TIMEZONE= None in my settings.py file ? because if i add this parameter as None It works fine for me .
Que 3: My project doesn't need database , so i put it in comments in setting.py file.. will it impact anywhere ?
please suggest me any sol asap /
thanks
Steps to reproduce
$ python manage.py runserver
my Settings.py --> TIMEZONE='UTC'
USE_TZ=False
Expected behavior:
example: my ubuntu time is sept 03,2018 - 18:51:11
Actual behavior
sept 03, 2018 - 21:57:11
