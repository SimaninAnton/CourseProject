I am using TokenAuthentication for several of my DRF views. The view code itself have optimized logic for to use memcached if the key exists in the cache - to speed up by reducing DB queries. However, I see that for each of the API requests from phone(client), the server still does one query at least - Postgres authtoken_token select for validating user for the authtoken sent
Is there a way to avoid this, since the authtoken is rarely changed - by keeping it in the cache?
I am using the following in settings.py, but I don't think this is helping my case
SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db"
