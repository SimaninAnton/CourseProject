by using the requires keyword in setup.py
Example:
https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/src/65e4c29a24e4/setup.py
motivation:
much nicer
tox.ini will reduce in size significantly
approach:
have setup.py find dependencies as stored in requirements.txt
don't use == signs in requirements, but rather >=, this will prevent unnecessary downloads
