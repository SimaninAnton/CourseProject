My project has Token as the default authentication, and my view permissions classes are: AllowAny and a custom permission that for the sake of debugging is always returning False. I'm sending a GET request with no custom headers and receiving 401, with the message:
{
"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
} 
Since my view has the AllowAny permission, I suspect it should never be returning 401, and in the specified situation it should be returning 403 instead.
Not 100% sure if this is a bug since it's not common to have AllowAny permission being used alongside other permissions.
