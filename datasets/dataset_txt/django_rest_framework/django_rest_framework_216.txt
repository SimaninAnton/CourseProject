I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Include a many-to-many field in model and in serializer.
Override model save() method to add or remove something from many-to-many field.
Expected behavior
What done in model save method should be final.
Actual behavior
No matter what you do in model save() method, the serializer will take all the related field data after model save is called upon. Whatever comes serializers m2m field is saved as it is, no matter what you do in model save()
I can take up this issue if approved. The expected behavior should be model save should be given more priority by default.
