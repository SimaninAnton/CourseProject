In other words if one of the fields to be serialized is another model serializer, filter_backends for the view is used on the querysets of subsequent serializer fields.
This creates a permission issue where I have a Serializer class
class StoreSerializer(...):
    item_set = ....
and a user is permissioned for the Store but not all items in the set.
This is one solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16821684/how-can-i-apply-a-filter-to-a-nested-resource-in-django-rest-framework but that requires putting request logic in the serializer rather than leaving it all in the View, which seems less than ideal.
