I am using python 2.7 and rest framework 3.5.
As the title suggests, the prefix is invalid in swagger. It's best shown by this image.
Expected behavior
The prefixes should have been "api" and "auth" instead of "pi" and "uth".
I suspect that it is due to the behavior of "os.path.commonprefix" in python 2.7
