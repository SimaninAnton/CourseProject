I have a MASTER/SLAVE setup of Postgres
MASTER : To write data
SLAVE : To read data
While trying to make PATCH request with POSTMAN I am getting following error:
{"error": "('cannot execute SELECT FOR UPDATE in a read-only transaction\n',)"}
I feel for PATCH request db_for_read is being called. Is there a way to fix it.
