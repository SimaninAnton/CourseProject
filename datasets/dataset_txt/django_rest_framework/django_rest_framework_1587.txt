I'm on Django 1.7 and DRF 2.4.x, don't know if that matters.
If I POST to an APIView, then inside the view the request.DATA is a QueryDict (and immutable), correctly. However, if I write a unit test and do APIClient().post(url, {}), the same request.DATA returns a regular dict. In the unit test case, it should normalize it as a QueryDict, so unit tests can catch bugs where the developer tries to mutate it.
