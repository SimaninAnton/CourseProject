Might it be possible to get pointers to the new data structures and the internals that I'll need to crawl in order to get allow_add_remove=True behavior in update() and create() of a serializer? validated_data doesn't have any model instance information so one can't figure out if this is an existing object or it needs to be created or what have you.
The serializer's self reference has the data field, but I'm leery of crawling through all the internal fields of serializer that aren't explicitly presented through the update() interface.
Could I get a little guidance?
