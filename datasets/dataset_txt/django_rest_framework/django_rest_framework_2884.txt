Right now if a lazy translatable string is rendered in a serializer fields everything dies with a <django.utils.functional.__proxy__ object at 0x7fac6c074290> is not JSON serializable error
Tom suggested this could be achieved by changing the code here: https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L168
Of course we will need some tests to ensure nothing else is broken. I will try to provide some tests.
