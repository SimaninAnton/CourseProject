django.forms.util.from_current_timezone allows you to convert a time to the current set timezone. you don't have to use this method if you don't want to, but you should factor in the current timezone context, not just the default timezone. This is important for instance is an app allows users to set the timezone (i.e., the super common case all your users don't live in one timezone)
