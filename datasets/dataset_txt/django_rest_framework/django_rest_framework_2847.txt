Within get_serializer_class you can get the request method via self.request.method and therefore pick out a different class depending on if you're doing a GET, POST etc. However, this doesn't sit particularly well with the browseable API and its creation of forms per HTTP action as they'll all be working with the GET method used to load the API page.
Would a pull request be welcome with an optional http_method parameter on get_serializer_class and an adaptation to the browseable API renderer that passes in the appropriate strings as needed? Or is there a better approach for solving this issue on the cards?
