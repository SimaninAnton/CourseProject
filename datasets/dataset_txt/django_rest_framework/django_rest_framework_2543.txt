The error string for a DateTimeField with input_formats=['iso-8601'] shows the time zone offset without a colon.
"Datetime has wrong format. Use one of these formats instead: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss[.uuuuuu]][+HHMM|-HHMM|Z]"
The framework won't actually accept a string in that format. For instance, "2014-05-05T12:55:00-0700", will trigger that message.
If you follow the ECMA format and include the colon in the offset, the string is accepted.
I believe the error string in question is located here (fields.py line 63):
def readable_datetime_formats(formats):
    format = ', '.join(formats).replace(ISO_8601,
             'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss[.uuuuuu]][+HHMM|-HHMM|Z]')
    return humanize_strptime(format)
I can add a pull request with the colon added there if that helps.
Thanks,
