Perhaps this is a good contribution or more likely there's good reason it doesn't exist.
This mixin allows a Viewset to pick between two serializers depending whether one or many objects are to be serialized. So, essentially, it's a handy way to achieve list / detail views.
Please use freely if it seems a useful contribution or ignore otherwise.
class ListDetailMixin(object):
    """
    Use a different serializer when display one or many objects.
    Overrides default serializer list_serializer_class if many
    objects are to be displayed.
    """
    def get_serializer(self, instance=None, data=None,
                       files=None, many=False, partial=False):

        if many and self.list_serializer_class:
            serializer_class = self.list_serializer_class
        else:
            serializer_class = self.get_serializer_class()

        context = self.get_serializer_context()
        return serializer_class(instance, data=data, files=files,
                                many=many, partial=partial, context=context)
