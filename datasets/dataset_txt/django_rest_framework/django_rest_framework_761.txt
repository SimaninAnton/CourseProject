This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
[] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
