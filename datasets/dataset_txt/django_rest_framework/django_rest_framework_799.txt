The web application we wrote depended on "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
This was a documented feature:
http://djangorestframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/browser-enhancements/
This is however deprecated since 3.3.0 per here:
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/browser-enhancements/#browser-based-submission-of-non-form-content
However none of this is found in the release notes. The place where I look to see if I need to upgrade and change parts of my application.
I would like this notice to be in the deprecation list of on the 3.3 release notice.
