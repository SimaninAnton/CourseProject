When editing a single user with the Admin browser or API HTML Form, the Superuser Status and Staff Status are checked by default, even if the user's is_superuser and is_staff are both False.
Furthermore, neither the Admin browser nor the API HTML Form allow setting those attributes to False if they are currently set to True. The only way to set these attributes to False is through the Raw data form.
