Currently there is not a very clean way of just adding a field which has to do some work with the model once it is saved.
This is a feature request which would allow me to do something like:
class MyField(serializers.Field):
    def model_saved(self, model):
        # do stuff with model
        pass
Currently the solution is to have a custom model serializer, but I don't think it's ideal.
