I Am missing a customizable Http404 (not found) exception in the response
If you want to give a bit more info on the not found to the user
I now created my own, but might be usefull to add this:
(or of course like the other exceptions an extended APIException for the 404 status_code ...)
in iamapps.exceptions.py (as an idea for rest_framewrok.exceptions.py
class IAmHttp404(Exception):
    pass

    def __init__(self, detail=None):
        if detail:
            self.detail = detail
and i use middleware for this to handle:
in iamapps.middleware.py
class IAmHttp404Middleware(object):
    """ 
    Make sure profile related 404 pages renders our specific template
    """
    def process_exception(self, request, exception):
        if isinstance(exception, IAmHttp404):
            return HttpResponseNotFound(page_not_found(request, template_name='iamapps/404.html'))
        return None
