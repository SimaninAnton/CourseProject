It isn't stackoverflow question IMO, so excuse me if it is
I'm trying to use nested serializers, I know it is tough to discuss since we had so many problems in v2-branch. I want nested serializer field to use default based on selected project.
Project ID provided in QUERY_PARAMS and applies in perform_create like it should now, in v3-branch. But I need project in some nested serializer field BEFORE save - I want to provide default values for object in serializer metadata, so user will be able to change some things, which optionally can be taken from project object.
So, I populate context in get_serializer_context with project object. And I should just rewrite __init__ in nested serializer to set defaults, ye?
The problem is, nested serializer does not recieve context nor parent in __init__. It seems, it does not recieve context at all! So, it should be a regression since pull-request 497.
I think, it isn't regression, more like design change, but I really need context to be able to change serizliser behavior!
