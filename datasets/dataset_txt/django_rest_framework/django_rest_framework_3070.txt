The "browse-able self-documenting API." link on http://django-rest-framework.org goes to "http://rest.ep.io/" ... which is just a splash page with "Weâ€™re working on something new. Want to be the first to hear?" and a signup form. I was kind of expecting, y'know, a browse-able self-documentating API ;-)
