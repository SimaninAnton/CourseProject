Right now it looks like Serializer.get_fields will overwrite the default field list if a Meta.fields attribute exists. I'd like to leverage the default fields and be able to simply append to that list of default fields (in particular when deriving from ModelSerializer). The use case here is when I have a reverse relationship to another Model. It seems unnecessary to be forced to list all of the default fields just to add a few new fields to the list. Is it possible to add this functionality?
