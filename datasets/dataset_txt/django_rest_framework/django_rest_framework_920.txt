I have upgraded django 1.7 to 1.9.12 and django-rest-framework 3.5.3
I am getting below error stack after running the server.
I have tried to apply various thing. but It doesn't help.
How can I solve this?
  File "/home/soham/Documents/upg/rest_api/api/models.py", line 7, in <module>
    from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
  File "/home/soham/Documents/upg/rest_api/_d_u/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/authtoken/models.py"line 11, in <module>
    class Token(models.Model):
  File "/home/soham/Documents/upg/rest_api/_d_u/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/models/base.py", line 94, in __new__
    app_config = apps.get_containing_app_config(module)
  File "/home/soham/Documents/upg/rest_api/_d_u/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py", line 239, in get_containing_app_config
    self.check_apps_ready()
  File "/home/soham/Documents/upg/rest_api/_d_u/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py", line 124, in check_apps_ready
    raise AppRegistryNotReady("Apps aren't loaded yet.")
django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
Thanks in advance.
