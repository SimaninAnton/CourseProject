When trying to add a token via the Django admin at /admin/authtoken/token/add/, I get the following error:
django.db.transaction.TransactionManagementError

TransactionManagementError: An error occurred in the current transaction. You can't execute queries until the end of the 'atomic' block.
This is with django==1.11.2 and djangorestframework==3.6.3.
UPDATE: I have also tried this with django==1.11.10 and djangorestframework==3.7.7.
