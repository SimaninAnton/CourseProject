It would be handy to add support for timestamps. This could be either controlling by some variable in settings such as USE_TIMESTAMPS or by setting DATETIME_FORMATS to something special...
The changes would very likely effect only https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L1034 - methods to_internal_value and to_representation and of course, DateField implementation as well.
What do you think?
