I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 -Werror manage.py generateschema --format openapi --url patchwork.ozlabs.org --description 'Testing 123'
Expected behavior
Output renders with info.description set to Testing 123.
Actual behavior
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 -Werror manage.py generateschema --format openapi --url patchwork.ozlabs.org --description 'Testing 123'
Starting patchwork_db_1 ... done
usage: manage.py generateschema [-h] [--title TITLE] [--url URL]
                                [--description DESCRIPTION]
                                [--format {openapi,openapi-json,corejson}]
                                [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}]
                                [--settings SETTINGS]
                                [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback]
                                [--no-color]
manage.py generateschema: error: unrecognized arguments: 123
I'm not sure if this is an issue with Django management commands or an really obvious oversight, but I feel like this should work?
