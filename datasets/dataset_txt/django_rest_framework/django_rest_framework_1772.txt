I noticed that it is hard to find out which is the current release version (3.1.3 currently) when I visit the website. I like to suggest that you add the most recent version to the start page so people do not have to search or go to this GitHub account.
Also the screenshot of the contains version 2.0.0 which might be misleading to a few users.
