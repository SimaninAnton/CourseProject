I'm currently trying to get the REST framework to provide a customizable user-facing form-based interface on top of TemplateHTMLRenderer. I've noticed that the BrowsableAPIRenderer has a neat serializer_to_form_fields method. It's weird to find this in a particular renderer, though - it looks like something which could be just as useful in a number of other contexts. It doesn't depend on anything in BrowsableAPIRenderer, either, so is there any particular reason why I shouldn't change it to a to_form_fields method of the Serializer class and send it as a pull request?
