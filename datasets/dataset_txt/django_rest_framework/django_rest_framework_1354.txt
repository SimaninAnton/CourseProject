Hi
I'm using rest_condition app and have permissions like below:
permission_classes = (Or(IsCreationOrIsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser),)
And it always allows access at the object level because:
class BasePermission(object):

    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        return True

class IsAdminUser(BasePermission):

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user and request.user.is_staff
has_object_permission is not overridden in IsAdminUser, so it will always give True.
My idea here is to return False in BasePermission.has_object_permission(request, obj) and override this logic in IsAdminUser and IsAuthenticated permissons.
For now it happens that object level permissions a given by default.
I can create PR for this if you agree with the idea
