Auth tokens should not be the primary key because they are visible in the URL when you visit them in the Django admin. This means that auth tokens are being leaked in access logs of any web server/proxy between the user and the application server
Checklist
[* ] I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
[* ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
[* ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
[ *] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
[* ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Go to the auth token admin and observe that the key is leaked in the URL
Expected behavior
