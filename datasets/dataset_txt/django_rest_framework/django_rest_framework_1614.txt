If you field name "title" is defined so that it's not required
title = serializers.CharField(required=False)
and you have
def validate_title(self, title):
  pass
then validate_title is never to be called on request:
{
  "something_but_not_title": "value"
}
Cause there will be a SkipField exception https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L436.
It may seem to be a correct behaviour and it's not documented http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#validation.
But may be it's not correct. What do you think?
