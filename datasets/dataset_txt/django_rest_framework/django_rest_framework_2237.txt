Hello,
I use DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE = "application/xhtml+xml" in my code. In fact stuff breaks if I don't use it.
It would be good if I could use it and not break the HTML pages in django-rest-framework. This only affects the login page.
Simple problems I have observed include:
html tag needs to be <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

Tag namaes should be lowercase; this breaks <Label ...>...</label>

Tags need to be terminated, e.g. <input ... /> instead of <input>.
The quick and dodgy fix would be to add the following to login_base.html, same as base.html:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
This basically overrides my XHTML declaration and says the page is HTML.
Thanks
