Somewhere between djangorestframework==2.3.13 and djangorestframework==2.4.4 the generated url conf for a ModelViewSet has changed to exclude '.' (period / dot) character. This means that your custom lookup_field cannot be a domain name, or some other string that includes this character.
Given a view set such as:
class ZoneViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    lookup_field = 'domain__name'
The following urls are generated (djangorestframework==2.3.13):
^api/ ^v1/ ^zones/(?P<domain__name>[^/]+)/$ [name='zone-detail']
^api/ ^v1/ ^zones/(?P<domain__name>[^/]+)/\.(?P<format>[a-z0-9]+)$ [name='zone-detail']
And now with djangorestframework==2.4.4:
^api/ ^v1/ ^zones//$ [name='zone-detail']
^api/ ^v1/ ^zones/(?P<domain__name>[^/.]+)/\.(?P<format>[a-z0-9]+)$ [name='zone-detail']
The [^] specifies an exclusion set, so [^/] excludes all forward slashes, whilst [^/.]excludes forward slashes and period (dot) characters.
I believe there is no reason to restrict periods in URIs and this change should be reverted.
