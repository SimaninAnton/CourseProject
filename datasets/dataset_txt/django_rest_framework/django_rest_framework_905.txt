It is common to want to remove serializer fields dynamically based on any condition.
So, I think we need to have an exclude_fields parameter available in Serializer Initializator.
if my_condition_to_exclude_fields:
    serializer = MySerializer(instance=myinstance, remove_fields = ['field_1', 'field_2'])
else:
     serializer = MySerializer(instance=myinstance)
I always create a mixin in order to handle that case, but why not has a parameter to allow that?
class RemovableFieldsMixin(serializers.Serializer):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        remove_fields = kwargs.pop('remove_fields', None)
        super(RemovableFieldsMixin, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        if remove_fields:
            # for multiple fields in a list
            for field_name in remove_fields:
                self.fields.pop(field_name)
