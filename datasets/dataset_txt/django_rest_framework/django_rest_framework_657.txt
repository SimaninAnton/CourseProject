Hi folks!
I want to have a possibility to explicitly add renderer class to my response(Response)
Because when I have way for handling either CSV renderer for response CSV file if everything is ok or
return Response in JSON format with an error message.
I can't do it with renderer_classes = ... or content_negotiation_class = ...
Thanks and Regards,
Mike
