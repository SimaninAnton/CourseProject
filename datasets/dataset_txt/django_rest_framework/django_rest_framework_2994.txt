I am not sure if this is intentional;
We noticed that some of our serializers that use the context from the view were failing after updating from 2.1.1 to 2.1.6
We tracked it down to BasePaginationSerializer, in init, where object_serializer is instantiated, the context is not passed.
We solved it since we override BasePaginationSerializer anyway, so it works for us to just do:
self.fields[results_field] = object_serializer(source='object_list', context=self.context)
in our PaginationSerializer's init.
