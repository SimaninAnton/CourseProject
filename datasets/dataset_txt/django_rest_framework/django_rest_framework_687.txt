After comment in #4202 it was suggest that I open a new issue , with python 3.5 my data is a dictionary and not a OrderDict so the result is almost random sorted and to fix it, we just need add sort_keys=True, in line 105 of /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/rest_framework/renderers.py where we have ret = json.dumps .
Reading de pull request mention my suggestion is if type (data) = dict use sort_keys=True if type of data is an orderdict don't
Thanks,

I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
