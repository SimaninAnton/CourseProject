Serializer.field_to_native() copes with source parameters having dotted values e.g. source='poll.choice.answer'
Serializer.field_from_native() doesn't - it fails in get_component because the object doesn't have an attribute 'poll.choice.answer' (serializers.py:442)
(Here's a more detailed example: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-rest-framework/dKDiLQ79BU4)
I think both should handle dotted paths in the source lookup so that the read and write are symmetrical.
