I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
# root/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin
from rest_framework.documentation import include_docs_urls


urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^post/', include('post.urls')),
    url(r'^docs/', include_docs_urls(title='My API title'))
]
# post/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^create/$',  views.PostCreate.as_view(), name='post-create')
]
The url to create the post is <domain>/post/create/
Expected behavior
( This screen comes up when you replace to url (r' ^/ $ ', views.PostCreate.as_view (), name =' post-create ') . )
Actual behavior
create under the create
Is this intended?
Although there is '/ post / create /' below.
in my think this is unclear expression of information.
I think it's a good idea to display the value of all the paths in url.(or namespace)
/ post / create / -> post-create
