Hello,
I have been digging around trying to figure out how to solve my issue where I have a username which is a PK and contains a dot ( . ) and it's breaking the api as it is breaking the username (e.g. mr.hello) into two parts, identifying the 2nd part after the dot as a format suffix so that'd turn into pk=mr, format=hello.
e.g. GET /api/users/mr.hello -> {'detail': 'Not Found'}

From what I can tell via looking through the routers.py and urlpatterns.py, there is no simple way to disable format suffix altogether which would be ideal for a case where I want to support lookups that contain a dot ( . )
I am proposing that a way to disable format suffix be added or some other way to handle this. Any thoughts?
Thanks

This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
