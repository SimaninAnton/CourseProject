I don't find a way to trigger Google Chrome's downloader (save As) when a page is loaded before the page is fully constructed. So the browser is waiting DRF to finish serialization before opening the Save As window.
As i'm not a pro of HTTP, is there a way in DRF to send headers before serialization is done ?
Like setting an unknown filesize, on any specific headers saying to browser that the response will be ready soon ?
NB: Sorry to post an issue again... did not find my answer, don't know what terms to search for. I don't think i can use a StreamingHttpResponse as serializer is not streamed, but i may be wrong.
