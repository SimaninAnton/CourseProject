Steps to reproduce
Define a field explicity on a serializer, than add extra_kwargs for that field in the Meta class
class MySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    my_field = serializer.CharField()

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = '__all__'
        extra_kwargs = {
            'my_field ': {'required': False}
        }
Expected behavior
Should not raise validation error when my_field is not supplied in the request body
Actual behavior
Raises validation error for missing my_field
I think this behavior is caused by this part in get_fields method.
If this is the expected behavior though, which could be taking possible clashing settings into consideration, I think the documentation should be updated stating that extra_kwargs will not be taken into account if the field is defined explicitly in the serializer.
