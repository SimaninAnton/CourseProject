Hello, Having some trouble with this. First of all, has_permission seams to get 2 calls. First is Obj=None, the follow call has a model instance.
And when Obj is not None django require a custom backend for object permissions.
You can read about it here, http://blog.dave-sullivan.com/?p=100
I have tested removed obj from has_perms() call with and that works fine for me, because i dont need to limit each record :).
