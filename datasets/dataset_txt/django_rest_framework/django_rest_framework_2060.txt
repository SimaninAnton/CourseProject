I've encountered the following exception when using the Browsable API in conjunction with the new namespace versioning and HyperlinkedModelSerializers:
AttributeError: 'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'version'
I've implemented get_serializer_class() as specified in the documentation:
def get_serializer_class(self):
    if self.request.version == 'v1':
        return AccountSerializerVersion1
    return AccountSerializer
I'm also using drf-nested-routers, and this is occurring on endpoints like /api/v1/car/1/tires/ where the Tire model has a ForeignKey to Car.
This only happens on the Browsable API; I can perform a GET request to the same endpoint using the JSONRenderer without exceptions.
