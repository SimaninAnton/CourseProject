I am trying to use django-rest-framework for a geographic data API in a geodjango project.
In geodjango, a geometry is an instance of GEOSGeometry which can be serialized with differents properties such as GEOSGeometry.json or GEOSGeometry.wkt (seems to be the default behavior).
With django-rest-framework, a call to the api with "_accept=application/json" always returns a WKT string (the default) instead of a json string.
