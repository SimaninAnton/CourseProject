I have a Django/Ember.js application which uses token authorization in the DRF API. It works nicely except staging server which also has nginx HTTP authentication (dev box runs on vagrant with the same puppet configuration, but without HTTP authentication). The stack is nginx/gunicorn/django.
The problem is with Firefox, while Chromium or Opera work. TokenAuthentication.authenticate gets for Firefox "auth":
b'Basic',
b'somevalue'
For Chromium:
b'Token',
b'someTokenvalue'
/api/ and /api-token-auth/ have no HTTP authentication now, but still either there is a bug somewhere or some proxy_* config is needed to pass correct value for HTTP_AUTHORIZATION.
If I remove HTTP authentication then it works. Anyone has a clue how to solve this problem?
