DRF doesn't remove reversed M2M field when passing attrs to model's initialization function. This causes following exception:
'sources' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
(where 'sources' is the reversed field)
Test case: http://dpaste.com/827169/ (Fails on first serializer.is_valid() call)
Traceback: http://dpaste.com/827162/
