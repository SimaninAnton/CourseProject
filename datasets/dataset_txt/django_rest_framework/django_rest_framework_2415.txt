For example JSONField that allows nulls results in this error:
File "rest_framework/serializers.py", line 910, in get_field
    return ModelField(model_field=model_field, **kwargs)
File "rest_framework/fields.py", line 400, in __init__
    super(ModelField, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'allow_none'
The problem might have been introduced by this commit.
Since only (DRF's) CharField and TextField allow allow_none kwarg, but not ModelField, it results in an error.
