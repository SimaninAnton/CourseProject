Django has an awesome etag/condition/last_modified decorator. It doesn't work with the d-r-f class-based views, as you cannot decorate 'get' with them. Because get returns an object that is not an http response, there is no way to add the etag header to the response.
I would like to see a way to do this from within d-r-f. I'm thinking something along the lines of an overridable method on a resource, or a view (or a mixin) that can be used to generate the etag.
The other way of doing it in django is to use the middleware, but it cannot shortcut running the body of the view altogether like the decorator can.
