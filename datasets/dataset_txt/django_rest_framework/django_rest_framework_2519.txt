Does 'type_label' in a ChoiceField shouldn't be 'choice' instead of 'multiple choice'?
class ChoiceField(WritableField):
    type_name = 'ChoiceField'
    type_label = 'multiple choice'
    form_field_class = forms.ChoiceField
I'm working on a MultipleChoiceField and I'd prefer to use 'multiple choice' for it.
