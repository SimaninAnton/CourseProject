I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
After googling and verified that several errors stops in this line
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/request.py#L384
when the error is in other place
instead reraise an error that doesn't explain the problem, I just replace with pass and I got the real errors .
