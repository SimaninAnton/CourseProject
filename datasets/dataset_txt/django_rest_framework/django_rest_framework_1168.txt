There's still a way yo go on this, but figured I'd get the ball rolling.
During development cycle:
Upload the new content to be translated to transifex.
Checklist:
Create pull request for release notes based on the 3.4.0 milestone. - See #4258
Update the translations from transifex.
Ensure the pull request increments the version to 3.4.0 in restframework/__init__.py.
Confirm with @tomchristie that release is finalized and ready to go.
Ensure that release date is included in pull request.
Merge the release pull request.
Push the package to PyPI with ./setup.py publish.
Tag the release, with git tag -a 3.4.0 -m 'version 3.4.0'; git push --tags.
Deploy the documentation with mkdocs gh-deploy.
Make a release announcement on the discussion group.
Make a release announcement on twitter.
