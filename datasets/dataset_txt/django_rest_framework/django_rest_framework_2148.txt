I am just upgrading to DRF 3.0, and I am pretty much there.
One thing for the upgrade docs / helping me... how do I contextualise the queryset now required for related fields to the request?
At ViewSet level, for the results, remains easy:
    def get_queryset(self):
        if self.request.user.is_staff:
            queryset = Book.objects.all()
        else:
            queryset = self.request.user.library.books.all()

        return queryset
But when customising the choices for a relation in a serializer:
    book = SlugRelatedField(queryset=Book.objects.all(), slug_field='isbn')
    #                                    ^ how request here? lambda... magic?
