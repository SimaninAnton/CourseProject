get_uniqueness_extra_kwargs and get_unique_together_validators both rely on Django's model unique_together specification. However, if read_only is set for both they should not be expected to be validated as normal. This reflects the behavior of django forms (exclude the field in form and it doesn't validated against this). This allows unique_together fields to be autogenerated in the save method of the model.
