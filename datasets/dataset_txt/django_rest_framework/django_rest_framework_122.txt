Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a model with a choice field (non-nullable and non-blank charfield), for example priority = low / normal / high. Create a model viewset and a model serializer,
Expected behavior
In browsable api the POST form should select the default value (normal) such as django admin model creation page is doing, so that the instance will be created with default value if the user does not touch the dropdown.
Actual behavior
In browsable api in latest DRF (3.9.4) the POST form is selecting the first value by default (low) instead of the default one (normal). The instance is created with non-default value if the user does not touch the dropdown.
