Checklist
I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a DecimalField decimal in the model with blank=True, null=True (and other args)
Create related Serializer
Try to save using serilizaer with decimal=''
Expected behavior
Should save value of NULL to db
Actual behavior
Returns error {decimal: A valid number is required}
Comments
I have looked at the code and it seems to be that the cause is
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L1052-L1055
We can add some blank/null handling like it has been done for CharField in
https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/fields.py#L772-L775
I am more than happy to open a PR with tests if this is something that classifies as a bug and will be accepted.
Please let me know :)
