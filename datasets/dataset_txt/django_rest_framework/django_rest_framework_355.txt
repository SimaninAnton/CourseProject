Description
When a unique constraint is violated status code is 400 Bad Request. Instead, I'd like 409 Conflict to be raised.
Expected behavior
I am able to subclass some of the DRF exception to raise my own status_code and my own error detail.
Actual behavior
When I create a subclass of ValidationError I can configure my own detail and it works fine. However when I want to configure my own status_code, it doesn't work at all and 400 Bad Request is raised anyway.
When I create a subclass of APIException my status_code is raised properly, but detail is wrong formated. It's not in a {'key': ['error detail', ...]} format.
