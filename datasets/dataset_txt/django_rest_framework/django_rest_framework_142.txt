It seems that the fund app is currently broken (and really slow) which results in really slow interaction with the docs (specifically, the search).
The specific link that's broken: https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/sidebar_include.js
For the time being I've blocked the url using umatrix which makes everything fast again. But would it be a possibility to load that script non-blocking/async?
So instead of:
<script src="https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/sidebar_include.js"></script>
We could have:
<script async src="https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/sidebar_include.js"></script>
