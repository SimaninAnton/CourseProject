This issue is to propose a way that a custom model field can define what serializer field it should use. For example add a class attribute to the new field.
The use case I see for this is: I create a reusable package that creates some new model fields. I want to include custom DRF serializer fields for them. I want to be able to, within the package, tell DRF to use my custom serializer field. I do not want all the users of my package to have to override the ModelSerializer or manually specify the serializer field every time they use it.
That is the general idea for it. I'd be interested to hear what you think.
As an example of how I envision this might be used:
class CustomURLSerializerField(serializers.URLField):
    pass

class CustomURLField(models.URLField):
    rest_framework_field = CustomURLSerializerField
