I have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of Django REST framework.
I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the discussion group instead.)
This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries where possible.)
I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)
Steps to reproduce
Create a model with an m2m field
Create a serializer for that model having Meta.extra_kwargs = {'field': {'validators': [MaxLengthValidator(1)]} }
Create instance of the model along with 2 values in the m2m field.
Serialize it.
Reproducer project: https://github.com/theoden-dd/django-reproducer/tree/extra_kwargs-validators-for-max-length
Expected behavior
Validation should fail with too many values.
Actual behavior
Everything seems to be fine.
