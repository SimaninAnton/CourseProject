I tried the most basic example posted on mitmproxy.org: http://mitmproxy.org/doc/scripting/libmproxy.html of the sticky master.
Using this example and visiting mitmproxy.it it says that if you can see the message, the traffic is not passing through mitmproxy. Obviously the traffic is passing through the proxy because otherwise no website would work at all. But http websites work fine, just not https. So there must be some additional magic happening in the inline scripts that make this all work. I confirmed with a separate test program that if I use the from libmproxy import mitmdump followed by mitmdump() then browsing to mitmproxy.it does in fact show me the cert to download. But I need to make this work without the inline scripts.
Am I doing something wrong, or is this a bug in the library?
