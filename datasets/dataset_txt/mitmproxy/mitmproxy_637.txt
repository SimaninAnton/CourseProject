The Javascript beautifier is currently very slow, and is a major performance/usability issue in the console app. What the user sees when switching to a JavaScript flow is a long - sometimes seconds-long - hang before responsiveness returns.
We have a plan to fix this - our contentviews should be lazy, and only prettify lines as requested. HTML has been fixed to work this way, and the implementation can be viewed here.
