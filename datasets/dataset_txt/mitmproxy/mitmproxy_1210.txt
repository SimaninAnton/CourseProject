I stumbled across LetsEncrypt.org, they offer valid signed certificates for free, for your (sub)domain. Can this be used along with some dns spoofing to allow mp to not need to generate self signed certs? I'm thinking of those few apps that refuse to accept my self generated cert even if I accepted it earlier.
Sorry if this is not the correct forum to discuss this.
