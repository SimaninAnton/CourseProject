not sure that this is mitmproxy issue, but without proxy everything works fine
could be reproduced easy
workaround:
mitmproxy and netlib is checked out to the latest version
running pure
mitmdump -p 8000 -w flows.log -v -v -v > mitmdump.log
open URL
https://www.natalie-tours.ru/booking/demandControlServlet
in firefox (23.0) setted to work via mitmdump at remotehost:8000
getting basic auth dialog
enter anything into login and pass
we should get login dialog again, because login and pass are wrong
but we have
firefox hanging for very long time (until manually stop to fetching url or mitmdump destroy)
here is screenshot of firefox while hang

first GET in network profiler is auth dialog, second one is hanged
here are flow.log

and mitmdump.log

any thoughts?
