Steps to reproduce the problem:
I had a problem with a client that sent a "wrong" GET request: GET HTTP/1.1 with 2 spaces between and HTTP/1.1
What went wrong?
exception from netlib/http/http1/read.py on line 247 because split in line 232
method, path, http_version = line.split(b" ")
seems to be wrong. I have fixed it for me be changing the split to
method, path, http_version = line.split()
Then it worked.
Best regards,
Thomas
