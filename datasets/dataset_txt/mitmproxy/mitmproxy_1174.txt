I'd like to be able to send the eventlog to a file using a cmdline option. My usecase is running mitmdump as a service on my Linux router in transparent mode. Services should not write to stdout/stderr, and what I'll be using to daemonize mitmdump will close stdout/stderr before executing mitmdump anyway. Even running mitmdump in quiet mode prints errors from the eventlog to the console.
