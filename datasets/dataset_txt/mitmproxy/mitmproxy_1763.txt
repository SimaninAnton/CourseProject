I made my own DumpMaster, simpler with less options, only what I need just to make libmproxy works more like a spider than a proxy itself.
I use first flow.FlowMaster.start_client_playback to play an array of flows loaded by _readflow, it works great, but when I try to use replay_request from FlowMaster it hangs and doesn't return.
I wish I could have a way to replay any flow at any other I wish, after read the response content back from some another previous flow I've ran.
Another example, to replay a client request until response.size() < 5000, and keeps comparing the response size every new client replay.
I don't see a way to do that so far.
This is a GREAT project, best work I've seen in years! Congratulations! You Rock!
Best Regards,
