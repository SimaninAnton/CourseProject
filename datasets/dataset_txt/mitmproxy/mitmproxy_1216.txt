Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run proxy on OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 Beta (pretty sure it happened with earlier stable versions)
2.Set up proxy on IOS 9.3 (and again earlier versions)
Request https://www.bungie.net/en/User/SignIn/Xuid?bru=%252f
mitmproxy crashes with Bus Error 10, and terminal is corrupted
What is the expected behavior?
Not crashing
Any other comments?
The bungie url redirects to login.live.com to do an OAuth login, it looks like the redirect is received by safari, and the next request/response crashes mitmproxy
mitmproxy version: 0.15
