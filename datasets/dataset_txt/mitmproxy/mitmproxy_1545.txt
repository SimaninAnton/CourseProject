Is the following setup possible?
Client <-> Transparent mimtproxy <-> Other upsteam proxies <-> HTTP/HTTPS Website
When I launch mitmproxy in transparent mode, both HTTP and HTTPS traffic is captured perfectly. However, when I try to use another http proxy from the client application, mitmproxy fails. This happens both when the final site is http and when it's https:
HttpError('Invalid HTTP request form (expected: relative, got: absolute)',)
Is this supported or am I doing something wrong?
