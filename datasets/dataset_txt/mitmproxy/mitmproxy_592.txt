Steps to reproduce the problem:
Visit any url with image inside or visit direct url image (i.e. http://i.imgur.com/rXodcGj.jpg)
mimtproxy shows response code 304 [no content] randomly
HTTP or HTTPS, same behavior (so it's not related to SSL Pinning)
Image loads for 200 response code, also for 304 response code
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
mitmproxy -p 1111 -U http://user:pass@x.x.x.x:8080 -s myscripttosaveimages.py
