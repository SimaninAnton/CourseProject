ref #1506
Recent core refactoring efforts touched our streaming support for large responses a couple of times.
Here a couple of proposals which could improve things a lot:
support request streaming
useful for file uploads, inspecting S3 clients and other HTTP-based storage APIs
see #1506 for an unfortunately now obsolete PR
stream by default for files larger than X bytes
AFAIK the current default is to just fail the request if the returned Content-Length is larger than --body-size-limit. This is not very convenient, nor intuitive.
support WebSocket streaming for messages and/or frames
typical WebSocket messages are small JSON-ish things, but one could do large binary file transfers as well.
