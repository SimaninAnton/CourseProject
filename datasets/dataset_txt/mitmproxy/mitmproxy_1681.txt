I have downloaded version 0.11 and I can use the new "--ciphers" option from the mitmproxy console. But how can I use it in a Python script with libmproxy? I can't find any mention of it using pydocs in the 0.10 release (not surprising), and pydocs doesn't seem to work in 0.11 from the master - no documentation is ever found.
My objective is to use this option with my existing transparent mode implementation to force the server to negotiate a cipher of my choosing.
Many thanks for the work you've done developing this flexible and very powerful tool!
