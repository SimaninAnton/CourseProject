Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy
Visit https://www.websocket.org/echo.html
Send some messages
What is the expected behavior?
The Websocket activity should be reflected in the UI.
What went wrong?
There is no UI indication that any activity is ongoing after the initial 101 Upgrade.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Similar to our TCP mode, we should have a --websocket/--no-websocket switch to control if the WS protocol is enabled. As we don't have a UI integration for this either, I would suggest to keep it turned off by default.
Setting this as a release blocker because the current master version swallows WS contents without showing something.
Mitmproxy Version: master
Operating System: Win10 x64
