Hey,
this is not a bug issue it's more a feature request.
Yesterday I made a STUPID mistake and named the config.yaml file config.yml. It cost me some time to find out. (Yeah I know that the docs say use config.yaml xD)
According to this post, the extensions .yaml and .yml are the same. The extension .yml has grown in Google search results, over the past years.
However, I thought, that accepting both file extensions would make mitmproxy more robust. I started to implement this "feature" for a pull request, and then thought that I should ask you first, if you even want to have it? Maybe you want to force people to use the correct extension.
