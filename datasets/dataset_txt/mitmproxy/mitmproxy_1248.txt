Hi,
I am running Ubuntu 15.10, and followed the instructions for installing mitmproxy on Ubuntu published on http://docs.mitmproxy.org.
But when I try to run mitmproxy, I get an error with the following traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/mitmproxy", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

The Python version is 2.7.10 (default, Oct 14 2015, 16:09:02)
Has anyone had any success with running mitmproxy on Ubuntu 15.10?
