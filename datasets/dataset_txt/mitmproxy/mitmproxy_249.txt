The http2 code seems to be buggy. Watching videos through mitmproxy on watchbox.de does not work. This can easily be reproduced, just try to watch one video on watchbox.de while proxying.
When disabling http2 support with â€”set http2=false the playback works, which indicates an issue in the http2 code.
