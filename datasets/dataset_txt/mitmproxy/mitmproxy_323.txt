Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.Start mitmweb
2.Try to shutdown with CTRL-C
3.Nothing happens
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
With the signal handler not being implemented on Windows, CTRL-C on mitmweb is not doing anything. On top of that the message "Proxy server listening on ..." doesn't appear anymore.
I found this workaround that I tested myself :

It's working, it's just that it's not a clean exit of the program
