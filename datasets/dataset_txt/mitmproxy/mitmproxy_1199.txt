Steps to reproduce the problem:
Access a Flow object in handle_response or handle_request
Print source_address property from the Flow's server_conn (ServerConnection object)
What is the expected behavior?
Should see a display of tcp.Address when ServerConnection is not None and only ('', 0) when ServerConnection is None.
What went wrong?
Only shows ('', 0) even when a valid ServerConnection is not None
Any other comments?
This does not seem to be affecting ClientConnection.address at all.
