Steps to reproduce the problem:
I used mitmproxy as forwarding proxy from Burp but I keep getting these error.

And this is error I get from console
mitmdump -p 8779 -s proxy.py

Proxy server listening at http://*:8779
127.0.0.1:56560: clientconnect
 << Invalid HTTP request form (expected: authority or absolute, got: relative)
127.0.0.1:56560: HTTP protocol error in client request: Invalid HTTP request form (expected: authority or absolute, got: relative)
