Hello,
Following the example in the documentation:
Ignore everything but example.com and mitmproxy.org:
--ignore '^(?!example.com)(?!mitmproxy.org)'
to ignore https interception for all sites but google.com and yahoo.com.
Then I use the command:
mitmdump --ignore '^(?!google.com)(?!yahoo.com)'
(For testing I use URL google.com/ncr to stick to .com, if it matters)
Both sites should NOT be ignored (use of ?! in the regular expression), but mitmdump log shows:
Seems that this regular expression leads to ignore everything !?
Many thanks
