Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump.exe --showhost --mode transparent
open one regular url web: https://www.google.com, it can capture successfully
open one https url with dedicate port: https://www.h.xiaohanapp.com:4445, it cannot capture
Alternate with no transparent mode, it can capture https://www.h.xiaohanapp.com:4445
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
In transparent mode, it cannot capture all http/https url with dedicate port.
While it did well in proxy mode.
