Steps to reproduce the problem:
record mitm flow
$ mitmdump -w test.flow &
$ HTTP_PROXY=localhost:8080 HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 curl -k https://www.google.com
then close the mitmdump session
open the flow w/ mitmproxy:
$ mitmproxy -n -r test.flow
go to the flow details section
What is the expected behavior?
Should see the SSL cert info. This info is available during a live mitmproxy session.
Using FlowReader programmatically should also expose the flow.server_conn.cert as well. It's empty.
What went wrong?
There's no SSL info available when loading flows from a log.
Any other comments?
The cert info does seem to be in the log if you manually inspect it. Doesn't seem to matter if you record the flow with mitmdump or mitmproxy
