Ubuntu 17.10
I'm using mimdump cloned from git.
I have a vpn server and use the following command to set up a transparent proxy
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner antiver --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
If my client access http://IP:8080/ directly from browser, the mitmdump will show infinite clientconnect until the server breaks down because of the shrotage of memory.
