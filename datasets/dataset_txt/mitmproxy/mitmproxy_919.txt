Comments re #1621. Being able to see the full URL in the terminal is too valuable to lose entirely. A better version of this would:
• Add a command-line flag to turn on full-width output (a la ``ps --ww). • Use the terminal width to determine the cutoff. See click.get_terminal_size()`.
• Maybe make the cutoff marker clearer by making it a different colour.
