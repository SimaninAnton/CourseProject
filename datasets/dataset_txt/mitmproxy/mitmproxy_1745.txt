Hey there,
With the next release, we're going to have support for multiple script arguments. Looking at the stickyauth and stickycookie options, are there any particular reasons why we keep them in the mitmproxy core? I see that we have a slight GUI integration, but does that justify it? --anticache is probably a widely used option and should be kept, but how many usecases are there for stickyauth and stickycookies?
Cheers,
Max
