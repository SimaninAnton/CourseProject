We should provide better guidance on the various ways to setup transparent proxying. Most notably, we should make the distinction between
internet <---> proxy <---> proxied network
and
internet <---> proxy  
           |
           V
    proxied device 
(proxy as custom gateway)
clear. The latter is simpler to set up but - allowing to bypass the proxy - obviously dangerous in some contexts. When we're at it, we should add a prominent warning that Linux sends ICMP redirects by default if the machines are on the same network.
