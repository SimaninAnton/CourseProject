I just ran mitmproxy -w existing-file and existing-file was overwritten with a 0 byte file. I guess it's my fault that I lost the session I recorded earlier, but I also believe mitmproxy (and ever other CLI) should catch user errors if possible. I don't know if this can be added in a backwards-compatible manner, because existing scripts might launch mitmproxy and don't expect a confirmation message when a file already exists. Anyway, I thought I'd ask what you think (basically I'm just sad I lost the file and wanted to share my loss :D).
