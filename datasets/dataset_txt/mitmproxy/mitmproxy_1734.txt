Hi,
Great tool you have developed here, but I'm trying to figure out how to make your libmproxy example code work (http://mitmproxy.org/doc/scripting/libmproxy.html). I modified it a little just to print out the message content and headers (You can see my code here: http://pastebin.com/m2PevqCy), but it keeps me printing the same error:
AttributeError: Request instance has no attribute 'reply'
I've installed from ubuntu repositories mitmproxy 0.8-2. I know the last version right now is 0.9.2 but I'm not sure if I have to upgrade it to make your code work correctly.
Do you have any idea why this error is happening?
Thanks!
UPDATE: Well, forget about it, I just upgraded with pip to version 0.9.2 and now it is working perfectly.
I'll left the issue here to remember the Ubuntu and Kali users that the default version provided in their repositories are obsolete and wont work with your examples.
