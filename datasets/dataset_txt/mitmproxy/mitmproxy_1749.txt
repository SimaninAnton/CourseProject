We should introduce a concurrent decorator to indicate that scripts should be processed in parallel (see mailing list discussion). For example,
def response(context, flow):
    if flow.request.host == 'www.yahoo.com':
        time.sleep(10)
should not block all other requests that arrive after a request to yahoo.
