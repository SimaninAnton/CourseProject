Hello,
I use mitmproxy a lot to execute automated tests against an Android client application in which the device receives pre-recorded responses to requests from mitmproxy using the server-side playback feature. This has been extremely useful to the automated testing efforts, however I am unable to use these recordings on a newer version because of a serialization version mismatch:
"Incompatible serialized data version: 0.11.3"
I reverted to v0.11.3 in order to continue using the recordings I have made, but would love to be able to use the latest version. Is there any way to port these recordings over to the newest version? I have quite a few recordings that involved a good bit of manual modification and cleanup to get them to work as I desired. It would be very frustrating and time consuming to have to redo all of them.
Thanks,
John
