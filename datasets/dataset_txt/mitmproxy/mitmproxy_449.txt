@MatthewShao implemented a really cool static viewer based on mitmweb last summer: http://honeynet.org/node/1359.
Long story short, one can upload a mitmproxy flow file at share.mitmproxy.org and will get a shareable link in return. To make this more accessible, I think it would be awesome to have a mitmproxy command that takes a bunch of flows as argument, uploads them directly from within mitmproxy, and returns a URL to share.
