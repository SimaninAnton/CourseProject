Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy
type O to open the options editor
move the cursor down to default_contentview and press Enter
type 4 to select json
type q to return to the flows list
the status bar now says “[M:json]” with the ‘M’ highlighted, as if it were a shortcut
however, typing M invokes “Toggle viewing marked flows” instead
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This is similar to #2953.
