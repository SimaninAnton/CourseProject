Steps to reproduce the problem:
Go to http://www.html-kit.com/tools/cookietester/
Click 'Set Test Cookie'
Observe that one cookie is sent to the server.
Remove the cookie.
launch mitmproxy with mitmproxy -t html-kit\.com and tell your browser to use it as a proxy
Reload the page.
Click 'Set Test Cookie'
Observe that two 'cookies' are sent to the server.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
There appears to be a comma in the output of mitmproxy, even though it is surrounded by quotes. It's possible, then that this is a parsing fail on the tool's end caused by a difference in what's sent back for the format of the date. Still, should it really be changing that?
