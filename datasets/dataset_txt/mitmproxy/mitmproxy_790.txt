Steps to reproduce the problem:
I'm parsing output of mitmdump in Objective-C and some major errors appears on standard output.
Example:
"Insufficient privileges to access pfctl. " (osx.py:34 - Treated with raise RuntimeError)
-> This appears on standard output, although it's a critical error on a configuration point of view
Instead, example of a correct error output:
"Error starting proxy server: OSError(48, 'Address already in use')" (server.py:51 - Treated with raise exceptions.ServerException)
-> This "correctly" appears on standard error
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This is just an example, there may be other critical errors which should be treated on standard error
