In my config file I have several scripts that provide content views and do other miscellaneous things that I would like to apply to all my sessions. If I invoke mitmproxy with any scripts on the command line then all the scripts I defined in my config file are overridden and only the scripts on the command line are used.
Is this the intended behavior? If it is, would it be possible to add a new flag for scripts that are not intended to be overridden by scripts passed on the command line?
