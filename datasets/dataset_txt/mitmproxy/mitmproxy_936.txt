I thought that I would let you know. 2.8 is out of beta and there are significant changes. First of all, fields are name-less and the "name" / Bytes(2) syntax is used. Secondly, pretty much EVERY class redesigned so nothing works exactly as it used to. (It works better.) I wanted to know if you are going to transition, if and how.
In 2.10 there will be cython depenedncy. All you will need to do is sudo apt-get install python{,3}-cython but that is just a heads up on my part.
Please voice any concerns openly.
