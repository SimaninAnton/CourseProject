I can't get the intercepted mitm.it page to appear when running mitmproxy -p 8088 and configuring an iPhone to use the machine running mitmproxy.
I've disabled cell data on the iPhone, and I can see the responses are being passed through mitmproxy and can be accepted or rejected.
So it's clear I have the proxy configured correctly, but mitmproxy is just not showing the magic page for some reason.
