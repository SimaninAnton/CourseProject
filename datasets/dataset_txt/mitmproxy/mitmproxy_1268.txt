I have mitm installed on ArchArm on Raspberry Pi where it runs without restarting for days. It's only used for proxying pages to one browser on another machine. While running, mitm's memory usage steadily grows (e.g. now, without any browser using it, I see in the 'top' that mitm uses 'VIRT 364m RES 266m' whereas yesterday it was 'VIRT 248m RES 169m' ). I don't know, maybe mitm is designed for massive scale proxying and caches memory for optimal performance, but is it possible to tweak some settings to reduce memory usage? Or it's just simpler to restart it periodically with a script?
