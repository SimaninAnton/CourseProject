Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run in Terminal.app export MITMPROXY_SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/Downloads/mitm.log
Run in Ternimal.appsudo mitmproxy -p 8888 --follow
Browse webpages with https enabled, then no related logs would be written in to ~/Downloads/mitm.log
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
All is fine without sudo.
