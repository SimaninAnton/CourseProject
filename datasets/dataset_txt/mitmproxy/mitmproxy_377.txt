Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy
type O to open the options editor
move the cursor down to replacements and press Enter
type a then /~s/foo/bar to add a replacement, and press Esc to commit
type q and again q to return to the flows list
the status bar now says “[Replacing]” with the ‘R’ highlighted, as if it were a shortcut
however, typing R doesn’t do anything
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
It seems like R was intended to be a shortcut for the replacements editor (which would be very convenient), but left out. It’s not listed in the online help, either.
If it wasn’t intended to be a shortcut, it shouldn’t be highlighted in the status bar.
