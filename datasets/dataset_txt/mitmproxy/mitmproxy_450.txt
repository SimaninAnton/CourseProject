Steps to reproduce the problem:
1 - Hit f type in filter, make a typo
2 - Hit 'f' again to fix the typo
Expected behaviour
On second hit of f, when filter in use already the command line shows the current filter.
Current behaviour
On second hit of f, whn filter in use already, the filter is cleared.
