Steps to reproduce the problem:
Editing a flow's URL currently requires the following keystrokes:
e -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> down -> enter.
This is a clear downgrade from 2.0 and before where each option in that dialog could be selected by pressing a specific key (e.g. u to edit the url). It'd be very useful to add these kinds of shortcuts to console.choose.cmd again. A bit tricky because we can't pass an explicit list as before, but still something we should do.
