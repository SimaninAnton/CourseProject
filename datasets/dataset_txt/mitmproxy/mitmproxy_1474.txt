Installing on Ubuntu 14.04, where pip links to pip3, and python to python3, the install process (e.g. running ./dev) fails in a rather ugly manner.
Furthermore, the setup leaves a big mess when it fails, particularly if you don't have virtualenv installed already - The command to virtualenv fails, but because the script doesn't set -e (exit on first error), it continues and then wound up trying to install a whole pile of crap into my system python.
It'd probably be a good idea to preferentially use python2 over python, since mitmproxy doesn't support python3, and you don't really know what python is actually pointing at.
Anyways:
./dev needs set -e somewhere.
python shouldn't be assumed to be an alias for python2, particularly going forwards.
Python 3 support would be nice, but 2 will be around for a while.
