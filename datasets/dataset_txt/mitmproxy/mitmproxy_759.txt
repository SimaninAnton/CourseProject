Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump -R https://httpbin.org/
curl localhost:8080/headers
This returns "Host": "httpbin.org" instead of "Host": "localhost", which was what the original curl request sent. We want to add a --keep-host-header to disable our automatic host header rewrite here. For a discussion of the rationale, see #2034 (comment).
Once implemented, we should change the dns_spoofing example to use that instead of doing the requestheaders dance. First, however, let's keep the PR small and only add the switch.
