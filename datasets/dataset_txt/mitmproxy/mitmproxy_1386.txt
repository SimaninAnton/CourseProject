Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy
Press "R" (Uppercase R) to enter "Replacement" mode to enter expressions
Nothing happens
What is the expected behavior?
The screen to enter "Replacement" expressions should appear to enable entering the filters and regexes to replace as per the doc in http://mitmproxy.org/doc/features/replacements.html
It's noted that the "on-screen" help doesn't show "R" as a shortcut.
What went wrong?
Not sure - no editor appears so there's no option to enter replacement
Any other comments?
This is a key feature of mitmproxy for me.
