Amazon Cloudfront has recently added HTTP2 support. Sorry, if this isn't an issue with mitmproxy and is with Amazon Cloudfront.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Make a request to https://s.yo.tv/v2/WCF/uk.svc/GS2?sT=201609240013&nNs=1&s=k9Ia4cM790llrCuBshmvDQ==&t=n&sL=1535&a=a.js
Works directly in Android app with HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2. Works with HTTP 1.1 using mitmproxy but fails with HTTP 2.
Cloudfront returns error - The request could not be satisfied
We've tried multiple URLs that also use Cloudfront and get the same error.
Mitmproxy Version:0.17.1
Operating System: MacOX
