Steps to reproduce the problem:
I am using mitmproxy on Linux, after I run the mitmproxy with this command "mitmproxy --listen-host 192.168.1.1 -p 8080", so that I can trace the user's traffic. Now my problem is I want to intercept user to access Facebook, Youtube, and so on, but I only can intercept the first domain name. I have no idea to intercept more than one website. Someone can please guide me.
And want to know how to intercept IP addresses as well.
Sorry my English is not good.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
