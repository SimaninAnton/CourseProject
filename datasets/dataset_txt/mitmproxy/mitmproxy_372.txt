Every major release I get a broken UX due to a shortcuts change. Furthermore, when I upgraded to 3.0 I've lost my favorite feature - export to clipboard as curl command.
But I found that in 3.0 we have commands and configurable key bindings. So I could solve my issue with them. I thought that way, but I was wrong - all bindings I've updated got lost as soon as I quited.
I had a quick peek into the source code, but the only explicit initialization of the keymap I found is defaultkeys.map(self.keymap) in master.py.
Is there a way to keep the changes in key bindings between restarts, that I've missed?
