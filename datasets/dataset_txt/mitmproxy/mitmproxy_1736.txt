Hey guys,
I'm trying to use mitmproxy to traffic my APP.
Mitmproxy is really a powerful tools and helps me a lot in testing App job.
Now, I'm having a problem when I try to traffic my APP.
The mitmproxy can't record traffic when my handset date time set in 1 hour ago.
For example:
Enable Mitmproxy at 10:00am, 01/06/2014.
and setting my handset at 10:00am, 01/06/2014. (with current time or after current time) >> That's working to record traffic.
If setting my handset at 09:00am, 01/06/2014.(or more early) >> Doesn't working to record traffic.
Can you guys help me?
Thanks a lot.
Andy
