Hi
I am trying to troubleshoot to get the mitmproxy up and running completely.
Here is my setup configuration:
client (linux) -> mitmproxy(kali-linux) -> server (windows2k8)
i fire up the mitmproxy using the command: mitmproxy -T --host
perform some operations on the client which sends requests to the server running windows 2k8 via the proxy.
i keep getting errors as below in the mitmproxy console:
client-IP:41217: connect
client-IP:41217: transparent to Server-Ip:443
client-IP:41217: 400: SSL handshake error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'sslv3 alert certificate unknown')]
client-IP:41217: disconnect
-> handled 0 requests
client-IP:41220: connect
client-IP:41220: transparent to server-IP:443
client-IP:41220: 400: SSL handshake error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'sslv3 alert certificate unknown')]
client-IP:41220: disconnect
-> handled 0 requests
so far i have done the following to fix this issue without any luck:
copied the mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem to the client machine and imported it into the application's keystore using command: keytool -import -alias mitmproxy -file mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem -keystore application.keystore
Here is the mitmproxy version running on Kali GNU/Linux 1.0.9:
Version: 0.10.1-1
Any help to fix this will be of great help!!
Thanks.
