I am realizing that for version 0.16, there is no tar.gz source distfile on PyPI any more.
Why is that?
Does this reflect an intended change in the way the software is published/distributed?
Steps to reproduce the problem:
N/A no real problem yet.
What is the expected behavior?
MacPorts so far used these tar.gz distfiles from PyPI to install mitmproxy. So we would need to understand if these will be published there in future.
What went wrong?
N/A
Any other comments?
I would need to understand the background, of the missing distfile (the one we use for installation), so that we can appropriately solve the issue with upgrading mitmproxy to 0.16. in a way that it works in future. TNX!
Mitmproxy Version: 0.15 vs. 0.16
Operating System: OS X (Macports)
