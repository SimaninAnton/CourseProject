I was able to successfully install mitproxy (confirmed by doing a 'pip list') but when I try to
install the mitmproxy certificate authority in the IOS simulator using the command:
./iosCertTrustManager.py -a ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
I get an no such file or directory error for .mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem. I tried to just find the directory by doing cd ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem, and even cd ~/.mitmproxy but again I get no such file or directory.
It's possible I am making a very simple mistake (I am a bit of a newbie) but I don't understand why I can't find the directory if the installation was successful. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
