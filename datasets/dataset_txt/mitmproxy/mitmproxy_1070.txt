Steps to reproduce the problem:
Type command "mitmdump -w temp" in console and then visit a HTTP website.
Close capture.
Execute "mitmdump -S temp" to replay.
What is the expected behavior?
Server-side replay should be performed.
What went wrong?
mitmdump hangs, no anything print out and also no crash.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
mitmdump have an alert like below, but I think it is not related to server side replay.
I searched this issue but nothing found, seems no one report this issue before. I appreciate if you can give me any advice.
lester@ubuntu:mitm$ mitmdump -S ./temp
ALPN support missing (OpenSSL 1.0.2+ required)!
HTTP/2 is disabled. Use --no-http2 to silence this warning.
