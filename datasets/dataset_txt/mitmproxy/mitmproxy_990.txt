We have a replacement editor (press o then R in mitmproxy) that allows us to add replacement patterns for flows.
There's also a --replace-from-file cmdline option that gets the replacement text from a local file.
But this functionality can't be used from the replacement editor itself.
A user tried to enter the path to file in the Replacement text field: https://discourse.mitmproxy.org/t/emulate-charles-proxys-map-local/116
