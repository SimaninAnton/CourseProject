Hi there,
I was trying to figure out why a specific application was not working with mitmproxy. After some delving around - it seemed that the Application is using SPDY (over port 443), while mitmproxy wrongly detected the first SPDY packet as a part of an SSL handshake (for which it reports "wrong version" and terminates)
Does mitmproxy support SPDY? perhaps it can be a nice feature to add SPDY recognition (or ignoring it in the meanwhile and passing SPDY packets not through the proxy)
Thanks,
Yoav
