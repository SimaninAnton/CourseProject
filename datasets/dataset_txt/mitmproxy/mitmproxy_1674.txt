Just something I wondered while I played around a bit -
I'm trying to run mitmproxy in tcp mode in order to facilitate working with non-http protocols. However - I've noticed that when using tcp mode it runs slower when compared to http proxying (try browsing to non-https website, like lifehacker.com)
Do you have an idea why that might be? Does the http proxy mode works differently in regards to fetching multiple resources (pipelining, etc.)?
Perhaps tweaking with the select timeout in libmproxy/protocol/tcp.py can fix that?
Would love to hear your input.
Thanks,
Yoav
