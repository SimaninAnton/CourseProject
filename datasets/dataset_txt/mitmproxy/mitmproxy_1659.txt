I was use mitmproxy successfully with emulator 4.0.4 ,but when i tried to use it with my device , it can not work .
I have try on my device , the browser on my phone shows "Failure to verify proxy server certificate" , and the mitmproxy can not get any traffic .
Could you please give me some suggestion ? Thanks a lot .
( My mitmproxy is built on ubuntu10.04 , and mitmproxy's is latest version , both emulator and my device are using same setting and install same mitmproxy-ca-cert file )
