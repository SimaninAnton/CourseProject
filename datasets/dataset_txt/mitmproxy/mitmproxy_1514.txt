Hi,
Perhaps this is more of a feature enhancement - but say that I have mitmproxy running on port 80/443 in transparent mode (HTTP proxy mode), and suddenly I get a non-HTTP connection over that port (This can happen with various applications that use proprietary TCP-based protocol over 443/80)
It'd be absolutely neat if it'd be possible to fallback to TCP-proxying on a specific problematic connection - this way the client won't feel any problems whatsoever.
I don't mind giving it a look myself - do you have a recommendation of how to elegantly achieve this behavior in the code?
Thanks a bunch,
Yoav
