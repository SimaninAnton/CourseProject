We need a better project slogan. This should be a short, pithy way of describing what mitmproxy does. The problem is that mitmproxy does so much that it's hard to be specific without rattling off a long list of supported protocols. Let's discuss.
To get things started, one possibility is to keep the slogan very simple:
mitmproxy: a man-in-the-middle proxy
And then list our protocol support prominently on the webpage, readme, etc:
Supports HTTP, HTTP2, Websockets and generic TCP connections. Intercepts traffic encrypted
with SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2.
