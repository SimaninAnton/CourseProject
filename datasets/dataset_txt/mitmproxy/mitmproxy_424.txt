Steps to reproduce the problem:
I just want to run mitmdump with the default mode....
For example, just run it. "mitmdump -p 8888"
Sorry,,my English is so bad.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I looked at all the problems, and there were a few of them, but they couldn't be solved.
For example, I try to add param "-Z 0" or "--stream 0" to avoid it,,,But it doesn't seem to work at all,.
Still memory leaks, the memory has been increasing, until out of memory..
