Hi cortesi,
I just noticed that saved flows only store the hostname of a request. I think netlib/mitmproxy should store the resolved IP address, too. The current implementation doesn't provide any way to check whether the ip associated with the hostname has changed since the flow has been recorded. What are your thoughts on this?
