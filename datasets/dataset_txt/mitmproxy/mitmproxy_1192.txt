Steps to reproduce the problem:
Did steps as described in README, cloned the project and then used ./dev.sh. When dev.sh script executes it gives error TypeError: find_packages() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include'
What is the expected behavior?
Virtualenv should set up.
What went wrong?
Unexpected error while installing TypeError: find_packages() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include'
Any other comments?
