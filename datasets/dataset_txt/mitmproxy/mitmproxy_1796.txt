I'm running into a weird problem where I can't get iOS to accept the certificate (mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem).
Running OS X 10.8.2 with homebrew, I created a virtualenv for mitmproxy, which I then installed in the virtualenv using pip. I then transferred mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem to my iPhone and installed it following the instructions here, http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/ios.html. The iPhone appeared to install successfully and I was able to configure my iPhone to connect to the proxy.
When observing traffic on my iPhone, I see unencrypted traffic (e.g. traffic to http://www.google.com) without any problems, but when I browse to an SSL site (https://google.com), the iPhone throws an error message.
Any thoughts as to what the issue could be?
