Steps to reproduce the problem:
Under KDE Plasma 5, perform any request
use C to copy flow to clipboard
I got this error: Export to clipboard (content,headers+content,url,as curl command,as python code,as locust code,as locust task)? Cannot find '.setClipboardContents' in object /klipper at org.kde.klipper
System information
Mitmproxy version: 2.0.1 (release version)
Python version: 3.6.1
Platform: Linux-4.10.13-1-ARCH-x86_64-with-arch
SSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0e 16 Feb 2017
Linux distro: arch
Since KDE Plasma 5, klipper is not used by default. Instead the clipboard widget is used which unfortunately doesn't expose a DBus interface. Of course I can manually start klipper to get it working, but who's assuming klipper is running on my system?
