Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'm frustrated when I want to get the attacker's real ip, I'm using python scripts in a addons method, but I try all 5 events style, I can only get mitm's ip by using:
flow.client_conn.address
Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like to know if there has had such a interface, or if there is a plan to get the real ip.
