How can I chain multiple proxies (HTTPS) according the the following schema
Browser -> mitmproxy-1:8080 -> burp/charles:8081 -> mitmproxy-2:8082 -> Internet
I know it's possible to chain mitmproxy-1 -> mitmproxy-2 and I've already tested that, but I can't put something else in between.
Is it even possible? How can I achieve that.
The goal behind this is that mitmproxy is great for scripting, but Charles/Burp are much better for manual editing stuff. I'd like to script some stuff in mitmproxy and later inspect requests manually in some GUI tool like Charles or Burp
