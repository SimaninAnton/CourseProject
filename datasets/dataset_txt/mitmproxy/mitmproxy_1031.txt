I often hit d as a way to navigate downward, a behavior instilled by less and my browser's navigation. However, when I do so I get ControlException: Message already acked and mitmproxy shuts down. Don't feel like I should be punished so badly. d should let me know less forcefully.
Mitmproxy Version: Fresh from the press.
I'll get around to looking into this.
