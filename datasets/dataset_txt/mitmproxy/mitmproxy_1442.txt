I'm interested in a webhook to auto build a docker container with mitmproxy in it. are you guys willing to create one for me so I can keep this in sync? Other than setting up an rss reader to do this I'm not sure of another way to do this on github.
alternatively if you guys want to have an official docker image I'd bad glad to contribute to that as well! :-P
