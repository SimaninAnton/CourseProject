Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I want to build a transparent proxy server which proxy all the http/https request. the clients has a customized dns server which resolve some domains to the transparent proxy server. For example, google.com will resolve to 10.0.0.1 which is the transparent proxy server, and When the user navigation google.com, all the traffics of google.com will send to 10.0.0.1.

Add some options which support this feature and let the proxy server listen 80/443. And ready for accepting request from network.
