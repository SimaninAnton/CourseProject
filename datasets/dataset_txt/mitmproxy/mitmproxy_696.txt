Steps to reproduce the problem:
install mitmproxy with apt-get
I realized this version was an old version so I uninstalled it
Tried to use the precompiled executables, but they don't work for me because I need to run python scripts with them that use 3rd party libraries
installed with pip sudo pip3 install mitmproxy
The install seems to fail
mitmproxy -bash: /home/mac/.local/bin/mitmproxy: No such file or directory
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The install seems to have worked, here is the install log
