Hi there,
today, I came across https://whiteout.io -> when trying to access the website through mitmdump, I get
"SSL handshake error: The client may not trust the proxy's certificate." from the mitmdump output, and Firefox tells me "(Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long)"
I have installed the mitmproxy certificate in Firefox, and other https websites like google.com or github.com work fine. What could be the problem with whiteout.io?
Further information:
$ python --version
Python 2.7.6
$ mitmproxy --version
mitmproxy 0.11.1
The error is well reproducable on another Linux box as well. Help is well appreciated.
Kind regards
Gordon
