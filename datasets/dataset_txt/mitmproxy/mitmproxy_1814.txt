I'm pretty sure the issue is me not getting it.
I edited my ~/.mailcap, tried both those lines:
text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
text/html; lynx %s
Reopened my shiny 0.8 mitmproxy, and sadly, still no lynx while using 'v' on response pages (open in external viewer, if I'm not mistaken).
Am I doing something wrong?
