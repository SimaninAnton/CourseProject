Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmdump
Visit some non-existing host with https (e.g https://abc123.org/) in browser that uses the mitmdump proxy
What is the expected behavior?
Status code 502
What went wrong?
I get status code 200 with the following content:
<html>
            <head>
                <title>502 Bad Gateway</title>
            </head>
            <body>ProtocolException('Server connection to abc123.org:443 failed: Error connecting to "abc123.org": [Errno 10061] Es konnte keine Verbindung hergestellt werden, da der Zielcomputer die Verbindung verweigerte',)</body>
        </html>
When i try to visit a non-existing host with http (e.g. https://abc123.org/) everything works as expected. I get status code 502 with the same content as above.
