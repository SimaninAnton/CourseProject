I have an application where I need to count incoming requests, and I use global variables for that, like
myVariable=0

def responseheaders(flow):
    #do something asynchronously and update myVariable
Which stopped working when I updated to 0.18.x, because it initializes myVariable over and over for each request :(
In case this is not a bug, what would the new designated facility to keep global state instead of global variables be?
