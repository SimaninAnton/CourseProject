Suddenly I am unable to launch mitmproxy, even after several reboots, besides my earlier issue it was working fine until I tried to launch it for a second time.
mitmproxy-3.0.3-windows> .\mitmdump.exe --set cadir=C:\Users\Admin\Documents\_custom_cert --
showhost --mode transparent
Error starting proxy server: gaierror(11001, 'getaddrinfo failed')
The error also happens with mitmweb and when there's no options supplied.
