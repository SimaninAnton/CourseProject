While using mitmproxy to capture traffic, I sometimes see the message:
No loggers configured for tornado.access
This is printed when the python logging system receives a log message for a logger that hasn't been configured. This warning message is written over the traffic I'm trying to view, and is rather annoying. It would be nice if mitmproxy at least configured all loggers to log to a null hander, so this message didn't overwrite the content being presented.
