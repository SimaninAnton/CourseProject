Steps to reproduce the problem:
add stream.twitter.com to /etc/hosts, pointing to 127.0.0.1
run sudo mitmproxy -R https://stream.twitter.com -p 443
attempt to connect to the Twitter Streaming API using tweepy
What is the expected behavior?
Stream connects, data is captured for analysis
What went wrong?
mitmproxy crashes. The error is attached -- it does something to the terminal that prevents me from selecting the text and copying it.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Mitmproxy Version: whatever pip installs right now
Operating System: Ubuntu Trusty Server
