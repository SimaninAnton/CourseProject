Hi,
I was able to successfully install launch mitmproxy how I wanted. Now a have a question about packages.
As I have found out mitmproxy doesn't do any assembling of messages. But I need to wait the very end of the message (suppose I know how it should end and maybe it can be large enough to be broken into peaces), check smth and only then send the whole stuff. Are the operations similar to these possible?
