Steps to reproduce the problem:
I want to create an instance by this docPtr.CreateInstance(__uuidof(DOMDocument30)); but result is
Information not available, symbols not loaded for msxml3.dll
#import "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msxml3.dll"
using namespace MSXML2;
After doing this dll is not load.
OS : window 10
