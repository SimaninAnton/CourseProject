I'm on Ubuntu 14.04
Took me a while to figure this out (I was not able to find any information on this when searching with the "mitmproxy" keyword). It's working out-of-the box with Firefox but not at all with Chrome.
The certificate downloaded from mitm.it needs to be added using certutil (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxCertManagement)
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "C,," -n <certificate nickname> -i <certificate filename>
I don't know where the best place to document this is. Starting now people searching for it will at least find this entry.
