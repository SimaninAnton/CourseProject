Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy
Type :console.key.bind global "ctrl q" console.exit to add a keybinding
Type ? to open the keybindings list
Scroll down to check that Ctrl+Q has been registered as a keybinding along with the built-in Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F
Press Ctrl+Q
This should trigger the console.exit command and thus exit mitmproxy. Instead, nothing happens.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Same if I replace ctrl q with shift pgup, so not limited to Ctrl.
