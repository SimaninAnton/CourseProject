Hello there.
I need to build a project (https://github.com/realgam3/pymultitor) and it requires mitmproxy < 3.0.0
The problem is that when i bundle netlib 0.16, it doesn't come along with these imports:
from netlib import strutils from netlib.http import url
which version of netlib comes along with mitmproxy 2.0.2?
and in case it is prior to netlib 0.15, the repository: https://github.com/mitmproxy/netlib/ is missing versions prior to 0.15.
Thanks in advance.
