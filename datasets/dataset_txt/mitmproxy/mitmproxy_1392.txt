Setup:
mitmproxy version: 0.12.1
Ubuntu 14.04.02 LTS
Problem description:
With command:
mitmproxy -I 'www.google.com'
(should ignores www.google.com, right ?)
For www.google.com/ncr URL mitmproxy ignores https as expected
For www.yahoo.com URL mitmproxy intercept https as expected
With command:
mitmproxy -I '!www.google.com'
(should ignores everything but www.google.com, If this regex is correct ?)
For www.google.com/ncr URL mitmproxy intercept https as expected
For www.yahoo.com URL mitmproxy intercept https, NOT as expected
Wrong regex or bug ?
