I was testing out a web API and used the "Export flow as Python code" feature for the first time as user, and noticed an improvement.
Currently we just export the flow.request.body as is (independent of it's content type) but mitmproxy's interface is smart and renders different bodies differently (for eg. it indents JSON)
I think we could add this indent behaviour while exporting things as code too.
