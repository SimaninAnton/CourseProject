Steps to reproduce the problem:
Rebuild on travis
What is the expected behavior?
No errors!
What went wrong?
Very occasionally, we observe this exception in test output, though no tests fail:
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 801, in __bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/Users/travis/build/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/protocol/http2.py", line 445, in run
    self()
  File "/Users/travis/build/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/protocol/http2.py", line 451, in __call__
    layer()
  File "/Users/travis/build/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/protocol/http.py", line 185, in __call__
    flow = self.channel.ask("response", flow)
  File "/Users/travis/build/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py", line 137, in ask
    raise exceptions.Kill()
Kill: None
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
