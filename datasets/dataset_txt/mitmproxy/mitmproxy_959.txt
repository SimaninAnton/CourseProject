Currently we use keybinding to perform actions (on flows etc.) but some of them have too much hierarchy.
Having vim-like commands for all actions that we can perform would be amazing.
Some examples: :filter-view <filter>, :delete-matching <filter>, :export python.
Of course the commands (& their arguments) will have autocompletion.
I think this will improve our keybinding system too & make them configurable.
ranger is file-manager written in python that has this vim style shell, so we could look at how they handle things etc.
