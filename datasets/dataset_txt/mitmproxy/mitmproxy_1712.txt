Hi,
This may be a simple issue, but I'm new to certificates and etc, so got a little confused. Let me explain...
I've setup mitmproxy for capturing android traffic. Everything ok..but...can't connect to play store (no connection). If I try to access mail.google.com from the android browser, it complains about the certificate but eventually loads.
This is what I see from mitmproxy event log:
192.168.3.100:33796: connect
192.168.3.100:33796: transparent to 74.125.139.95:443
192.168.3.100:33796: disconnect
Firing up wireshark, I see the SSL handshake, up to the encrypt alert from server, than, the client resets the connection.
So...installed in mitmproxy cert in the Android (2.3.3) test subject, and everything worked.
My question. I'm dealing with certificate pinning here , or is it another issue ? My big problem is that my goal is to test another app that uses https for flaws, and I can't ask the user to install a certificate! I has to be in a mitm way...So, is it possible to bypass this ?
Regards
