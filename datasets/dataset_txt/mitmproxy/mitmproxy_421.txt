Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy
Capture some flows with method POST and form in JSON, Example Website
Press enter
Press e -> form
Press q
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I think the basic problem lies with JSON Parsing, Even if the form data is empty and you try to change mode by pressing m and selecting json . It says Couldn't parse: falling back to raw
