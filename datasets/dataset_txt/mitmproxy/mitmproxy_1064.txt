Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump -r dump -s script
What went wrong?
Only the request script hook is executed.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The problem is in FlowMaster.run_scripts, where we check for if not msg.reply.acked. If the first hook acks the request, things break.
