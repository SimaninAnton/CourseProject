I know I can filter the domain, or ignore other domain by:
mitmproxy -I google.com
but sometimes mitmproxy breaks other daily browsing. For example, Dropbox and Google Drive will not sync when mitmproxy is working. There are many other services not working, so I don't think it is a good idea to ignore all other domains one by one.
Can I just intercept the http traffic on single site abc.com?
