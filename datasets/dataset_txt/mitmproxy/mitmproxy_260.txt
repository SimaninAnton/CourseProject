I have removed the certificate pinning from the application, and redirected all the traffic via MITMPROXY UI.
I can read the HTTPS Traffic, but the "Secure Web Socket" traffic isn't anywhere? I can use a debugger like Charles, which would show raw connection.
Does the web ui support "SECURE WEB SOCKETS"? It connets fine to it, just can't read it using the tool..
