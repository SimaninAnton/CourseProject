Hi,
I am trying to set-up a MITM-like attack using mitmproxy and it seems to work as expected, except that when I visit google.com or facebook for example I get an error saying that the server certificate presented by mitmproxy doesn't match the URL. In this case, given the attack I want to do, the certificate is not trusted (not installed on device) which is excepted, but it was my understanding that the server certificate should still match the URL?
Here are the command I use to run it:
mitmdump --cert {location_cert_file} -e -vvv -p {port_setup_iptables) -T -z --host -w {save_location}
I am using mitmproxy 0.9.
Am I missing something or doing something wrong?
Thanks a lot in advance for your help!
