Hi,
I'm trying to use mitmproxy with the following setup:
router R forwards 80 & 443 to a more powerful machine M
machine M runs mitmproxy and does not have access to the routing table on R
Looking at the code, seems that the dst address is detected as
dst = self.resolver.original_addr(client_conn.connection)
Is my use case something for which mitmproxy was not designed to do?
PS: i got it working with a few changes, i can polish'em and send a pull request.
