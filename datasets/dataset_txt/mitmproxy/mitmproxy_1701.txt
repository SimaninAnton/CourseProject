I'm having problems getting the latest mitmproxy working
I cloned the most recent mitmproxy en netlib sources and installed them using pip. No errors there. However, once I run mitmproxy, I get the following proxy config error:
File "/usr/local/bin/mitmdump", line 4, in
from libmproxy.proxy.config import process_proxy_options
ImportError: No module named config
Can't figure out what I am doing wrong. Has anyone experienced the samen or (better yet) have a suggestion for me on how to solve this?
I rescued an old ipad2 from being updated to 7.1 and would love to see --cert-forward in action ;-)
