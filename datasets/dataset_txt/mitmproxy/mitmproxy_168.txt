Hello,
we are working on adding the tool in Gentoo (https://bugs.gentoo.org/572170) and noticed that the current requirement list is too strict.
https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/setup.py#L63
You have restricted ALL new versions just in case which is not much better than pining dependencies to specific versions
Please remove this restriction unless it is known that a package changes an API frequently.
Thank you.
