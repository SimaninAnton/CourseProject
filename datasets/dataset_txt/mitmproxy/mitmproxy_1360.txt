I'm running "mitmdump -T --host" (v0.13) on Windows 10. HTTPS/SSL works fine with Android and iOS devices after the certificate is accepted via mitm.it. However, I'm unable to get HTTPS/SSL working on the same Windows 10 system or even on remote Windows 10 systems connecting in. I don't recall running into this issue with mitmdump v0.12 and Windows 8.1. Is something broken in v0.13 or Windows 10?
