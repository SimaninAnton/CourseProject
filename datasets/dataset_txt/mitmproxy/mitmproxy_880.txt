Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install Python 3.5 on Windows
pip install mitmproxy
Building lxml version 3.6.0.
Building without Cython.
ERROR: b"'xslt-config' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I attempted to install a binary version of lxml but it will not work because the oldest lxml version available for Python 3.5 on Windows is 3.6.4 but mitmproxy required 3.6.0.
