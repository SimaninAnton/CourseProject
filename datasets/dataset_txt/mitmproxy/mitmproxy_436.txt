Hi
I have IoT device/s which I successfully managed to decrypt its traffic using mitmproxy. Now I want to save those traffic for further investigation and analysis. Indeed I saved it using ( -w output ) command but I could only open it in text a format and it seems a bit miss as well as it is difficult or let's say time consuming to analyze. So please could you advice if there is any way to save the decrypted traffic in a pcap file.
Thank you in advance , notice that this will help me a lot for completing my research
