Since the Macbook Pro does not have a Page up/down key, I have to use Fn+Down and Fn+Up. However, it does not work when mitmproxy is running and I'm viewing a flow using the Terminal.app. If I page up (fn+up), it will page up the terminal window but not the response window area.
May I suggest alternate keys? Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D is what I use in vim for paging.
Thanks.
