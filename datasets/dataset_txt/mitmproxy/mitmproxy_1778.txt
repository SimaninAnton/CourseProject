Hi,
I've been trying to work with mitmproxy (awesome project) for a day, trying to figure out why the embedded browser in an application was giving me "Unable to display webpage"-pages when proxied through mitmproxy.
It turns out, via. Fiddler, that when Mitmproxy is being used, the Content-Length header is being renamed "content-Length". If I in fiddler, intercept the response and rename it to "Content-Length", it displays the webpage as expected.
I've been trying to search for the phrase in the source, but I can't find it anywhere. I'll debug to see if it happens for all requests, or just this one page the embedded browser is viewing.
The command for Mitmproxy was:
./mitmdump -p 8001
Nothing fancy :P
