This is not really a problem, but an enhancement.
mitmproxy's main screen lists the requests along with the response's status code. When you're pentesting, you need to take a look at each response, but you need to enter each one and switch to the response tab.
Now think about sifting through that when you have more than a thousand requests to check?
Would it be possible for the team to create a split view of the main screen where we can see the response of the highlighted request? I've created a (very ugly) mockup of my idea below.
Sorry, couldn't upload it here, github might have some aesthetic bots to block it...
