Not sure if it's a bug or desired behavior, but it looks like an issue for me. Simple script like
def request(context, flow):
    flow.intercept(context._master)
correctly sets "'intercepted': True", but flow is actually accepted by mitmproxy (I assume that if interception pattern is not set, intercepted is set to False somewhere).
