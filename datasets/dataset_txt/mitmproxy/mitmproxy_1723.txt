I usually use mitmproxy to check request/response json, and when the json is really big, I need copy it to other viewer for more convenient operations. But current 'b' save function will only save the original body.
can I have a feature that save the unzipped/decoded body to a file, so I can open the file and read them in a more direct way?
Thanks in advance
