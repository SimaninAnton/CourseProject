the next thing I got stuck on was knowing how to edit the gzipped response (it's cleartext in the preview)
the cleartext in the preview was confusing because editing the raw body gave me...the gzipped content naturally.
I had to then figure out the z key and how to disable compression so I could edit the plaintext content.
