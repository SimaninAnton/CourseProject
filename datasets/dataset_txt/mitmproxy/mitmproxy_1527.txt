hello
I have a problem. I installed mitmproxy without any problems on xubuntu 14.04. I have an Android smartphone and have set the gateway so that all data go to my Computer. What works well so far.
But when I type the two commands
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to --dport 80-port 8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to---dport 443 port 8080
I try to load a page on the phone and nothing happens. And also mitmproxy shows nothing.
According wireshark the Computer definitely got requests from the mobile phone. The mitmproxy's CA is installed too.
Can someone help me?
