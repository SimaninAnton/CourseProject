Steps to reproduce the problem:
set up mitmproxy and visit mitm.it
it loads but I can't click on anything nor view any icons (I do see the text though, like Windows, Android etc and the footer)
therefore I can't install certificates
does this mean something is wrong with my setup?
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Even tried with a browser instead of mobile, didn't work
System information
mitmproxy --version
Mitmproxy: 3.0.3
Python: 3.6.5
