Steps to reproduce the problem:
following the guide for custom certificates at http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/certinstall.html
use openssl as described to create a certificate for a specific domain
start mitmproxy with --cert=cert.pem
mitmproxy intercepts all https connections using that certificate
What is the expected behavior?
mitmproxy would use that certificate just for the domain specified in the certificate's CN
What went wrong?
mitmproxy uses this very same certificate for all https connections, I think defeating the CN mapping
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
verified that this certificate is used instead of mitmproxy generated and self signed for another domain then specified
Mitmproxy Version: v0.17.1
Operating System: Kali Linux 2.0
