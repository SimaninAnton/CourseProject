I find a bunch of keyboard shortcuts a bit odd. But since this issue hasn't been raised before, I think the other users might be okay with them.
Since we already have a config file setup in place, would it be too much work to implement a configurable keymap system? Would it be worth it? I am asking this because I would love to work on this feature!
