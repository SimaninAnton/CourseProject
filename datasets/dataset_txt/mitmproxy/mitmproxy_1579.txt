We have a variety of bug reports wrt. the installation procedure. While installing mitmproxy itself usually doesn't cause any issues, our dependencies often do ( #396, #379, ...).
We should document installation instructions for Linux, OSX and Windows, both for binary distributions as well as for installing from source.
