I'm on OS X 10.8 and Android 4.4.2.
I've used mitmproxy previously with success, but when I altered my Android's settings today I get:
10.0.1.17:60366: connect 10.0.1.17:60366: 502: Transparent mode failure: could not resolve original destination. 10.0.1.17:60366: disconnect -> handled 0 requests
In the even log for mitmproxy on my mac, instead of seeing intercepted requests.
I'm on the latest version of mitmproxy too.
The certificate from ~/.mitmproxy is installed on the Android device
Any clues on how to fix this?
