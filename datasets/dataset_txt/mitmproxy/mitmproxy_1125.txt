Steps to reproduce the problem:
add inline script 'redirect_requests.py' to mitmproxy command line
What is the expected behavior?
mitmproxy window opens
What went wrong?
Get following error
Script load error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/flow.py", line 694, in load_script s.load() File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/script/script.py", line 85, in load sys.exc_info()[2] File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/script/script.py", line 80, in load exec (code, self.ns, self.ns) File "/Users/peterglock/Documents/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/examples/redirect_requests.py", line 1, in <module> from libmproxy.protocol.http import HTTPResponse ScriptException: No module named libmproxy.protocol.http
Any other comments?
changing libmproxy to mitmproxy allows the script to run
