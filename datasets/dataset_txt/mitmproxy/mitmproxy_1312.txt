I forgot one little problem. In the documentation in part Hacking it is said to call source ./dev. Thus the script is running in the current shell session. If virtualenv is not installed than exit is called closing the current shell session. Thus in a terminal the terminal is closed and in a virtual console the whole session is terminated and user is logged out. In both cases the printed error message is not visible. The user only see that the terminal is closed or they are logged out.
