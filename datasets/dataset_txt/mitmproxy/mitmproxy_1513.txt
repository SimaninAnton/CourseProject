I am using mitmdump in a transparent mode. Some requests are passed through a small script which takes the request data and stores it in a MongoDB collection.
I have noticed a fresh startup of mitmproxy sits at about 1 to 2% CPU usage, even before the first request comes in. After running for a week or two, it will sit at about 3 to 4% CPU, and will accumulate a rather large memory footprint.
I am not sure what debugging info to provide for this sort of problem.
