Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy.
Press n -> Enter -> Enter -> e -> set-cookies
Press a to add a new row.
Choose Attributes column and enter subeditor.
Add any name-value pair, for example a 1.
Go to flowview tab by pressing q twice. You will see this in Response tab:

I am not sure it is correct to display just = without anything
Press e -> set-cookies. You will see, that name-value from Attributes column moved to high-level name-value:
set-cookies was changed in Response tab as well.
Strange behaviour.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This small bug is relevant for 2.0.x version as well.
