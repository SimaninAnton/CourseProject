When I'm busy in mitmproxy, I often mark an important flow using m to preserve it for easy access; my flow list grows pretty quickly even when I'm using a filter, so I often clear the list using z to tidy up.
Up until very recently clearing the list preserved my marked flows, this was very convenient because I could "clean up" my window and keep what's important (my marked flows) around and continue working.
I've installed the latest version (mitmproxy 1.0.2) and I've just noticed that clearing the flow list also removes the marked flows.
Could I request this be added as a feature if what I've described was occurring by coincidence, or to be fixed if this is a regression. It is a super handy feature for myself, and hopefully others too.
Thanks
