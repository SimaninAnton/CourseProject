At the moment, the type we use for Path values is str. We use paths in many options, and we'd like to handle them specially in user interfaces (so we can, for instance, do path completion on tab).
We should teach optmanager to know about a Path type, which is treated just like a string. Ergonomically, I'd like user to still be able to say options.path = "value" rather than have to say options.path = types.Path("value"), so it would be good to automatically handle type promotion.
