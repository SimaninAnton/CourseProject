9e94fdc introduces a console import in mitmdump.
# The unneccesary console import here is to work around a bug in pyinstaller
This breaks mitmdump compatibility with windows as urwid isn't available. I don't know what kind of bug this is referring to. Any chance that there is a different workaround without these implications?
