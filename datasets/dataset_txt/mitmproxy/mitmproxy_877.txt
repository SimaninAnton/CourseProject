What do you guys think about navigating left/right with h / l between flowlist and the tabs in flowview.
Basically, when you are in the flowlist and have one flow selected, you could hit l to bring you to the flowview for that item (instead of using Enter). Then, once inside the flowview the navigation would be as it is now, except for when you are on the Request tab and hit h, which would bring you back to the flowlist (instead of going back to the Details tab).
Maybe it's just me, but I think it is more natural and would allow faster navigation then with Enter and q. Even though we could of course keep the actions for Enter and q the same, just add the new ones in addition.
What do you guys think?
