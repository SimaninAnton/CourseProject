Steps to reproduce the problem:
Private key is inserted in .p12 file, although filename says "mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12"
Output can be verified with:
openssl pkcs12 -in mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12 -nocerts -nodes
I don't have a Windows machine to test if a .p12 file would work without the private key inside.
We can generate a .p12 file without key with:
openssl pkcs12 -export -nokeys -in mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem -out mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12
-> If private key is needed, file could be renamed "mitmproxy-ca.p12" for better understanding
-> If private key is not needed, .p12 generation should be modified
