I'm confused if mitmdump/mitmproxy supports recording to a file, using a recorded file to replay, but guaranteeing that any additional requests outside of the recording list will not be made to live servers.
I had assumed the -k, --kill Kill extra requests during replay. switch would prevent extra requests, but I think I am wrong (or am using it incorrectly).
My use case: I want to use mitmdump as an automated testing tool for mobile applications. I'd like to start mitmdump as a proxy, setup the proxy on the mobile device, do a run with real request recorded to a file, then restart mitmdump in replay mode, and guarantee any additional requests made by the mobile device client never hit the internet. This allows me to run my automated tests without worrying about doing anything improper, even if I am running against a production environment.
Is this type of usage supported?
The commands I used:
$ mitmdump -w sample_recording
....
$ mitmdump -k -S sample_recording
