Been trying out mitmproxy and must say it's quite awesome. One thing that I'm unsure if it's something I've misconfigured or not is that WebSockets get dropped after the 100 Continue response from the server.
I don't expect mitmproxy to log off the web sockets but it would be nice if it transparently let them continue to run?
Is this possible / planned / able to be scripted?
