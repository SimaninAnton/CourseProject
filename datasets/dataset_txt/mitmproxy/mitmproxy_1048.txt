    100% |████████████████████████████████| 317kB 1.3MB/s
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    platform cygwin is not supported

    ----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /cygdrive/c/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/pip-build-MAxy7J/psutil/
I proposed removing psutil as a required dependency before, but I'd be open to any other solution. @cortesi?
