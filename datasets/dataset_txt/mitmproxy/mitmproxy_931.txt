Steps to reproduce the problem:
Visit https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/master/examples for the first time.
Be overwhelmed. (@mitmproxy/devs may not be able to reproduce this)
What went wrong?
Our examples directory has grown organically and I feel there are too many too complex examples in there that scare users away. It's not really clear where to start.
What is the expected behavior?
We should guide users to the simpler, more frequently used examples like add_header.py, filt.py, modify_response_body.py or redirect_requests.py and hide the more complex ones.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I would propose to split the examples folder into "beginner" and "complex" and (after this, in a second PR) add a README in the examples folder that guides the user. The beginner examples don't have to be trivial, but they should have a high usefulness/complexity ratio.
I'd be more than happy if a new contributor wants to pick that up and let us know which examples are helpful for mitmproxy beginners and which aren't!
