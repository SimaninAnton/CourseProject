Steps to reproduce the problem:
docker run mitmproxy/mitmproxy:dev
docker run -i mitmproy/mitmproxy:dev
What is the expected behavior?
The user should see some reasonable error output in both cases - when we attempt to run in a non-terminal, and when we're running in both a non-termina and non-interactively.
What went wrong?
We see a crash in case 1) and an unresponsive screen in case 2.
