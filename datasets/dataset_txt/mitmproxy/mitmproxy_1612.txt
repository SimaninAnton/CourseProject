I'm not sure if this is actually a urwid bug or the way mitmproxy uses it.
In framebuffer, xterm, terminator etc. if I set the editor to be vim and try to edit the raw body of the request/response the cursor disappears. This can make editing more tricky than it needs to be!
In addition, if I background the process with ctrl-Z the cursor has gone from the terminal and from vim when I open it on any file. The cursor returns as soon as mitmproxy is cleanly exited by hitting qy. If it is killed (with kill -9 or -15) then the cursor is still missing. Starting mitmproxy and quiting will restore the cursor.
Thanks for all your hard work on my favorite proxy :)
