For a study project, i decided to build a GUI for mitmproxy as a learning project.
I originall planned that his tool would run the ProxyServer itself instead of running another tool (mitmproxy) next to it and communicating with it, but seems like it recent versions this functionality has been mostly replaced and it is strongly encouraged to use mitmdump and the scripting api.
Now, let's say in this GUI tool, users could see a list of Request and dynamically mark those to edit headers on the fly, how would i communicate this to the mitmdump script in realtime ? I can use command line arguments or start a lot of subprocesses per Request to be analyzed but that is not really a good solution.
Do i have to use a shared database that the inline script as well as the GUI app would access to get dynamic data? Running the server inside the same process would make this easier.
Any help much appreciated
