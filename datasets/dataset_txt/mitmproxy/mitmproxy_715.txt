The template here wasn't relevant so I cut it, apologies.
mitmproxy currently mandates cryptography <1.8 which when built from source on macOS/OS X El Capitan (10.11) using Xcode 8 results in Symbol not found: _getentropy errors. Reported and explained in more detail here, hence my short summary. These issues were fixed in pyca/cryptography#3354, which was released in the 1.8 branch.
This is also currently causing some "fun" for downstream package managers having to carry their own somewhat hacky patches like this. The gist of my request is whether mitmproxy has plans to/would consider update/updating cryptography to use the latest release without these issues.
