Steps to reproduce the problem:
On
Open a request that contains WBXML (for example, sync requests of Apple Mail app)
In both the request and response tabs I see Couldnâ€™t parse: falling back to raw
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I tried different versions of python with virtualenv, no difference.
I tried installing from pip and from brew, no difference.
I tried version 0.17.1 binary directly: worked (but I would prefer a not so old version)
I tried version 2.0.2 binary directly: didn't work.
