quoting @tacahiroy:
I've noticed shortcuts 'g' and 'G' are backward as less behaviour. Is there any reasons for this?
I'm bit confused whenever I use these keys.
Quoting from man 1 less:
g or < or ESC-<
        Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)

G or > or ESC->
        Go  to  line N in the file, default the end of the file.  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large, or if N is not speci-fied and standard input, rather than a file, is being read.)
