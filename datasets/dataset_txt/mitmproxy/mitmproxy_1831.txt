So i'm not sure why this is happening, I've downloaded and compiled the newest version of urwid, and pulled from you git repo, for some reason this keeps freaking out whenever I go to get more detail about a connection.
Ubuntu 10.04LTS x86_64 running python 2.6
Version 0.6 seems to work fine, although I was getting a traceback with something last night I don't remember...
Traceback (most recent call last):
