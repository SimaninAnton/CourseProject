I'm trying to use transparent mode on freebsd, but it doesn't seem supported:
# mitmproxy -T
usage: mitmproxy [options]
mitmproxy: error: Transparent mode not supported on this platform.
I wonder if its just because its not considered in libmproxy "platform", since OSX is supported, and maybe its easy to add FreeBSD support, or is it something more complex?
