After a fresh install of version 0.6 from PyPi, when running mitmproxy I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/mitmproxy", line 19, in
from libmproxy import proxy, controller, console, utils, flow, cmdline
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libmproxy/console.py", line 19, in
import urwid
ImportError: No module named urwid
setup.py should probably reference urwid (I see it does in the latest code on github).
