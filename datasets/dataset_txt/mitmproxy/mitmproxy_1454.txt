Hey,
is it possible to view the Cipher Suite used to encrypt the traffic? I think this could be interesting while testing some application without the need to set specific ciphers. E.g. this information could be saved as an attribute in the HTTPMessage class. Moreover this could be helpful to check if the something was really encrypted, e.g. by setting the attribute to None (or is this information already provided by the scheme attribute?).
