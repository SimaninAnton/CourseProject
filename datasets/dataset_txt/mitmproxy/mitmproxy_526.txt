Steps to reproduce the problem:
Setup mitmproxy
Setup SLL certs on Android device (I used this tutorial https://blog.heckel.xyz/2013/07/01/how-to-use-mitmproxy-to-read-and-modify-https-traffic-of-your-phone/#Install-mitmproxy-CA-certificate-in-the-phone)
Download Nintendo Switch Online app
Try to login
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
When trying to log in to services that utilize reCaptcha, mitmproxy seems to block the connection to the reCaptcha server, preventing the login from continuing. I was attempting to sniff the requests sent by the Switch app but was unable to login due to the reCaptcha failure.
