Steps to reproduce the problem:
Connect to mitmproxy through your phone.
Install Certificate through Safari
Attempt to open Snapchat causing failure.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I'm brand new to project so maybe I might have missed something. So far I've gotten everything up and running (most connections work through safari). Here is a log from the console:
Proxy server listening at http://0.0.0.0:8080
192.168.1.6:53270: clientconnect
192.168.1.6:53270: CONNECT app.snapchat.com:443
 << Cannot establish TLS with client (sni: app.snapchat.com): TlsException("(-1, 'Unexpected EOF')",)
192.168.1.6:53270: clientdisconnect
192.168.1.6:53271: clientconnect
Thanks for any help beforehand!
