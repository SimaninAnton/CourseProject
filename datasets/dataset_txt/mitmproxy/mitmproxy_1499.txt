I cannot start mitmproxy caused by the following failure:
You are using an outdated version of pyOpenSSL: mitmproxy requires pyOpenSSL 0.14 or greater.
Your pyOpenSSL 0.13.1 installation is located at /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/OpenSSL
But pyopenssl 0.14 is already installed. I also have tried to uninstall/install (again) mitmproxy and/or pyopenssl. Same result. I am using OS X 10.10.2.
