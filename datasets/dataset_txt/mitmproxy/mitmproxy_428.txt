Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy/mitmdump with script -s "script.py"
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I'm using mitmproxy version 0.15, how do i know which python version does it use?
I assumed that it uses python 2.7 from th docs.
the only problem i don't understand is why do we need parentheses in print function if it is python 2.7???
the print function gets overwritten somewhere??
System information
output when i just do print without parentheses :
print jsonResponse ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
