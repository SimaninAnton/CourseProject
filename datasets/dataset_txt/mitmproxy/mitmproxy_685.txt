Steps to reproduce the problem:
When editing my script, I will hit control + s to save my work. Mitmproxy (or dump) will reload the script this forces my script to load twice over (I have a save feature that will spit out that it is loading and saving). Checking memory, I see that the memory usage of Mitmproxy has double and the CPU usage has went up just a bit. Over time, if I continue to run Mitmproxy without closing it out and save/restarting it again, the memory will hit 80-100% causing the system to be unstable, slow, or full on freeze.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Not sure what the problem is 100%, but I've seen this before with python garbage collection. Something not releasing access and so there for never gets garbage collected.
