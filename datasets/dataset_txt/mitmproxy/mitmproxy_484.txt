It took a while to work this out and I can't - installing the certificate on ios (don't know since what version) isn't from http://mitm.it isn't enough - you also need to enable full trust for the root certificate for it to actually work. Otherwise, Safari will ask if you want to go to a site every time and mitmproxy will report handshake errors with the client not trusting it's certificates - it looks like pinned certs but it isn't.
It would be great if you could update the docs with the following. Ideally, this would be mentioned in the html of the page at http://mitm.it or at least somewhere in the mitmproxy docs like maybe here
On the ios Device need to :
Install the mitm root cert as usual from http://mitm.it
Open the Settings app
Tap General
Tap About
Scroll to bottom. Tap Certificate Trust Settings
Turn on the switch for mitmproxy
