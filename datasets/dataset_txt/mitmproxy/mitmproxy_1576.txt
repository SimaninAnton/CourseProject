I have a class that inherits from controller.Master, and I'm overriding handle_response to set flow.response.content to an empty string. Two things seem to be wrong when I do this:
The connection stays open for about 10 seconds, instead of closing immediately.
Content-Length is set to the original value instead of 0.
I don't see this behavior when using any other string response.
