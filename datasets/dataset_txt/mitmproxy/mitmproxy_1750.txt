I'm trying to use mitmproxy to build testing tools for iOS development.
mitmproxy is really a powerful tools and helps me a lot in testing App job.
mitmproxy will sit between iOS device and our server, in order to generate logs and run scripts to verify all parameter passed correctly to our server.
we got one problem is when I set up mitmproxy, the Apple’s In-App-Purchase did not work.
I would like to ignore all requests&response of domain “apple.com”.
Because I do not want to intercept anything in "apple.com".
Could you do me a favor tell me how could I make it?
