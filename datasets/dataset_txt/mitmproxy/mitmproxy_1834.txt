When Iâ€™m browsing a connection, I want to save the request and response body to a file (with the b key).
However, when I press b, I get the "Save body request:" prompt line, but after entering a filename (eg. foo.txt), I get a Python traceback that is pretty hard to copy/paste since it's merged with the current lines on the terminal.
The last lines of the traceback are these:
path = os.path.expanduser(path)
   NameError: global name 'os' is not defined
However, I am able to save a "flow" (with the W key) to foo.txt just fine.
