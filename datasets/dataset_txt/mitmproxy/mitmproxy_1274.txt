Step to reproduce the problem:
Open a HTML webpage in Chinese with mitmproxy.
Switch to the Response page and view the content.
What is the expected behavior?
Should display the content like
<meta name="description" content="中文字符"/>
instead of
<meta name="description" content="&#20013;&#25991;&#23383;&#31526;"/>
What went wrong?
I guess libmproxy.contentviews.ViewHTML should be improved to fix this.
Any other comments?
It's really confusing seeing whole screen of these unicodes instead of the correct characters. Hope we can fix this soon!
