I think we should have some doc pages targetting new contributors.
I was once talking with @s4chin and he had a very simple question "How do I understand mitmproxy's codebase? It's huge and I have no idea where to start."
Understanding new codebases isn't an easy task, but we can surely tell people where to start.
Some contents (off the top of my head):
The Hacking & Testing section from the Readme
Describe the basic folder structure
what is where
what are netlib/pathoc etc.
how they fit into mitmproxy
'Suggested/Further Readings' for topics like HTTP/2 etc.
There are a lot of people who just know python and want to contribute to open source projects but may not know all the advanced networking topics involved.
I didn't understand 70% of what is on the How mitmproxy works when I read it for the first time.
Some of the files already have a top-level docstring. Extending this to every file would be great.
Thoughts?
Seeing Anaconda's Developer Docs finally made me open this issue.
