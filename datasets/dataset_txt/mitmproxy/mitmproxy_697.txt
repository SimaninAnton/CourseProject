Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy on the machine with non UTF console environment
Error message:
Error: mitmproxy requires a UTF console environment.
Set your LANG enviroment variable to something like en_US.UTF-8
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
For the first timers it is a bit confusing (I have en_IN language)
Because one can't view anything (say options, version etc)
Maybe choosing one from the existing UTF languages on the machine would be nice.
Need your suggestions.
