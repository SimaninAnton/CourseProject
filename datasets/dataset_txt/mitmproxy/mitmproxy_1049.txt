Steps to reproduce the problem:
Use firefox and connect to mitmproxy with socks mode.
Connect to https://www.facebook.com or https://accounts.google.com .
Try to login.
What is the expected behavior?
Should get 200 OK and login to the website.
What went wrong?
Get 302 redirect from both sites and redirect to the original login site.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The behavior will be normal if we disable http2.
