Problem
I started mitmproxy with the following command:
mitmproxy --setheader /~q/User-Agent/"TEST"
This is fine, all User-Agents have been modified to "TEST" in mitmproxy, but
When I turned to inspecting requests in firefox dev tools, all the request User-Agent headers were not changed
So, does it work?
Enviroment
Mitmproxy: 5.0.1
Python: 3.6.8
OpenSSL: OpenSSL 1.1.0j 20 Nov 2018
Platform: Linux-5.3.7-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64-x86_64-with-centos-7.7.1908-Core
Firefox: 68.2.0esr
Thanks!
