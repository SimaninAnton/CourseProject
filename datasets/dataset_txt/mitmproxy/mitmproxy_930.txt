Is there any way to view TLS version in the Details tab?
I use mitmproxy 0.17.1 and Details tab shows certificate info and TLS timings, but not TLS version. Many sites enforce TLS 1.2 (or 1.1) and finding which version is in use is essential for debugging.
I'm not sure if that is possible, but if client -> proxy connection uses one TLS version and proxy -> server another, please add both versions in Details tab. BTW, this would be a very helpful feature if older clients (i.e. TLS 1.0) are able to connect to newer servers (TLS 1.2).
Thanks,
