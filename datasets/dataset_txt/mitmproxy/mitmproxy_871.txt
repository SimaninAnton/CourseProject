Steps to reproduce the problem:
Turn on mitmdump and go to:
https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-strict-ssl-protecting-against-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-on-origin-traffic/
You'll get a 400 error.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Is that error related to certificate pinning? Is there a possibility to auto detect Cloudflare sites and ignore them for proxying. A way would be to read the cloudflare header and ignore if it appears but what if other CDN providers have that protection too?
