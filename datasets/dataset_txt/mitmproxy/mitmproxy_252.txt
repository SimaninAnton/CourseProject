Steps to reproduce the problem:
Enter the following into ~/.mitmproxy/keys.yaml, expecting the
effect to be that n gets bound to console.nav.down:
 -
   key: n
   cmd: console.nav.down
Start mitmproxy
Press n
Observe that n is still bound to console.command view.create get https://example.com/,
as per https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/mitmproxy/tools/console/defaultkeys.py#L61
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This seems to be a conflict between the implemented behaviour and the
expected behaviour (At least my expectations).
My motivation for this possibly unanticipated key binding is that I'd
like try and make bindings similar to the defaults of emacs dired
mode, which would make mitmproxy easier to use for me.
With a few hints on where to fix this and some guidance, I'd be happy to try and do it my self.
