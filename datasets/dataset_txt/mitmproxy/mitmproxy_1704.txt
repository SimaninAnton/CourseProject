Hi,
I was wondering if there's a way to save entire decrypted packets (eg. to a pcap file) so I can later open it with Wireshark. If using the "-w" parameter - in what format are the flows exactly saved in? (I'd assume that it's purely the HTTP header and content and not other layers)
Mainly I'd like mitmproxy to save an entire decrypted client-server session to a file that I can later open with Wireshark.
Any advice?
Thanks,
Yoav
