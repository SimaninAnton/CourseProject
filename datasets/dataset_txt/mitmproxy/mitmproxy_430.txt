Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy.
Make a request with pathoc: pathoc -c example.com:80 localhost:8080 'get:/SOMETHING VERY LONG'
Enter the corresponding flow.
You won't be able to see request/response/detail of the flow without changing size of your window.
But if we decide to make a request with url over for example 10k length, even changing the size of window won't help you to see request/response/detail tab.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
About maximum length of a URL
