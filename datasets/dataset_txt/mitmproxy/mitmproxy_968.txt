Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump
What is the expected behavior?
mitmdump should print some notification that it is running and ready to receive traffic.
What went wrong?
mitmdump just displays nothing, it looks like it hangs.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Ideally we'd only show that if mitmdump is invoked in a tty?
