Steps to reproduce the problem:
Open https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mitmproxy
Notice that README is broken.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
PyPI is super restrictive about restructuredText, we probably have some validation errors. Might make sense to have that checked on CI if possible without too much effort.
