Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump '~u google.com'
and I get:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "release/specs/mitmdump", line 3, in
File "mitmproxy/tools/main.py", line 155, in mitmdump
File "mitmproxy/tools/main.py", line 116, in run
File "mitmproxy/optmanager.py", line 212, in update
KeyError: 'Unknown options: view_filter'
[5149] Failed to execute script mitmdump
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
mitmdump --set dumper_filter='~u google.com'
works, but not so handy like v3.0.3 or before.
Maybe help text needs update, too. It is saying view_filter option.
mitmdump --help
usage: mitmdump [options] [filter]
positional arguments:
filter_args Filter expression, equivalent to setting both the
view_filter and save_stream_filter options.
