I want to intercept the traffic between a desktop Electron app that I am running locally on my Mac while I program it and a copy of my server-side Rails app that I am running locally on my Mac at http://localhost:3000.
I presume the settings I need are:
Transparent mode
No certificate required for non-HTTPS
A pf.conf that looks something like rdr on en2 inet proto tcp to any port 3000 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080
However, I don't know what network interface to use instead of en2 in the above.
What do I use?
At bash, I get:
$ networksetup -listallhardwareports

Hardware Port: Display Ethernet
Device: en2
Ethernet Address: 40:6c:8f:55:28:9c

Hardware Port: Display FireWire
Device: fw0
Ethernet Address: 00:0a:27:02:00:4a:f6:31

Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en0
Ethernet Address: 00:88:65:3b:fa:ca

Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN
Device: en4
Ethernet Address: 00:88:65:3b:fa:cb

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 1
Device: en1
Ethernet Address: 32:00:14:05:ba:60

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge
Device: bridge0
