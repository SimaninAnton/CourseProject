Hi,
I asked before a question about how can I save a mitmproxy data in a pcap format Issue #2806.
So based on the suggestion to (1) log the TLS master secrets with mitmproxy and (2) use a normal PCAP tool for packet capture, I tried to do it myself but unfortunately it did not work or maybe I did something wrong
if some one did this process and it work with him, please help.
Thank you
Anoud
