How is mitmproxy to handle the editing of gzipped data in an external editor?
Would it be better to let the editor bear the burden of uncompressing/recompressing, or would it be better if mitmproxy did this automatically?
If it's the former, I think adding the relevant extension to the file would help the editor identify it as zipped.
