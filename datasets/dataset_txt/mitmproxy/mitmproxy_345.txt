Dear all,
I'm using mitmproxy to realize man-in-the-middle attack in order to monitor the network behavior from my android emulator (API 23) on genymotion environment while opening some malware apps.
In the meantime, I wonder how to extract all http/https traffic flows to a txt file from mitmproxy's console view.
I've executed "sudo mitmdump -w outputfilePath" but found that the mitmdump was listening on 0.0.0.0: 8080, which is out of my expect (my proxy is established on 211.21.X.XX:8887) so that the result txt file didn't meet our requirement.
Thanks for your kindly help : )
