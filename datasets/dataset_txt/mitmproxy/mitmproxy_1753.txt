I was following the instructions for Android on http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/android.html
Android was not detecting the certificate on /sdcard/Downloads but it worked when getting it to just /sdcard/. I'm using CyanogenMod 10.1.3 which is based on Android 4.2.2.
I could not test on stock or OEM Android yet, nor other Android versions.
