Steps to reproduce the problem:
Develop a need to use an external package in your mitmdump script, e.g BeautifulSoup.
Realize it's not documented.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The only reference I was able to find online to this issue was on Discourse.
Although the solution presented there did end up helping me solve the issue - the fact that this is not documented anywhere (as far as I could tell) in the official docs is not great.
I would be happy to submit a PR in the Scripts part of the docs, but I don't think the solution I ended up using is very good - I just ran /path/to/mitmproxy/libexec/bin/pip3 install <libname>.
