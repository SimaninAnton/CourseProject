Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy from terminal
go to mitm.it to get certified --> Here it shows up as two GET requests to mitm.it as expected
THEN, I can't visit any other websites, as I just get a 'Safari cannot open the page because it could not establish a secure connection to the server'
How do I work around this??
Thank you very much!
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
