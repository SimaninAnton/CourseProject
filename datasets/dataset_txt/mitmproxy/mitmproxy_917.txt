Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmproxy
curl -x localhost:8080 https://example.com/
View Details Tab
What is the expected behavior?
The Server Name Indication sent by the client should be displayed in the UI.
What went wrong?
The SNI is not displayed in the "Client Connection" section.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The first step here is to make a .sni attribute in ClientConnection which also gets serialized. I'm happy to help if anyone wants to pick this issue up!
Mitmproxy Version: master
Operating System: Win10 x64
