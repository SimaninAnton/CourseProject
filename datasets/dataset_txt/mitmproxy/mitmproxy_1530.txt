Hi guys,
I have been using your tool for a couple months now, and so far, I think it is an amazing tool. It has a very good interface and is easy to use and set up. However, I have encountered a case in which mitmproxy does not provide the functionality I need.
I am working on a use case in which I want to be able to view all traffic and connection attempts sent by the client whether the server responds or not. At one point the client makes a connect attempt the a server that results in a connection timed out error (netliberror [error 110]). This gets recorded as an error in the event log but does not show up in the traffic recorded by mitmdump. Would it be possible to have an attempt at a connection that ends up timing out get recorded with the rest of the traffic?
Thanks for all the work. Your tool is really awesome.
