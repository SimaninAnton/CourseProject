I did some work on the mitmweb options today and noted the following things:
I feel that we should make flow_detail and verbosity choices instead of ints to increase their usability. It's not really clear at the moment what "verbosity=2" even means.
There are a whole bunch of options in mitmweb now which don't make sense for mitmweb (view_filter, keepserving, flow_detail, ...). Do we want to keep and ignore them, or are there better solutions? Maybe it's just enough to move them into addons that are only loaded by the respective tools?
Quite a few options still don't support live editing. We really should fix as many as possible before the next release (@ujjwal96, maybe some easy tasks for you if you want?), For the proxy server options, this refs #2185 and the sans-io work.
mitmweb currently does live-editing, i.e. if you type a character, we immediately try to update the option at the backend (there is throttling, but that's it). That is great for most options, but I wonder how we should treat cadir, which, if we would naively implement live edit support, would create a new CA dir for each character that gets typed. Similarly, rfile, which currently only reacts to running at startup. Maybe mark some options readonly during execution?
