flow_detail and verbosity are currently specified as being integers. The UX of those options is terrible at the moment: there's neither an indication of allowed values nor an explanation on what those values would do.
$ mitmdump --options
# Log verbosity. Type int.
verbosity: 2
I would propose to make them somewhat useful choices instead of ints. This can hardly be fixed by extending the help text alone, see the help text style guidelines.
