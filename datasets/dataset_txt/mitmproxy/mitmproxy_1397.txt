Hi,
I'm constantly getting the following error when using the the decoded context manager (from libmproxy.protocol.http) in combination with BeautifulSoup and libmproxy:
encoding error : input conversion failed due to input error, bytes 0x8F 0x0B 0xFC 0x61
I tried to figure out the source of this error but was unable to track it down, it sometimes impedes certain sites from displaying correctly (which would make sense since it's an encoding issue).
Was just wondering if I'm doing something wrong, you can find an example of the code I'm using here https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf/blob/mitmproxy/plugins/inject.py
