Hi
Is there any way to start mitmproxy in non-interactive mode? It is, it just records the traffic, writes the log in a file, but the app is not displayed in the screen?
Im mainly interested in this option for the docker image, as i need to start it always in interactive mode (-it parameter)
Thanks
