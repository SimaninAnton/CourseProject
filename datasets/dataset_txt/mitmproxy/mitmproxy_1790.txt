If I have a python proxy script and want to 'drop' requests for some 'bad host' it would be nice to be able to kill the flow at the request stage. I assume this is the purpose of the flow.kill() function. The flow.kill() function has a required argument called master. As far as I can tell the only place you can find 'master' in your script is context._master however using this feels a bit dirty since _master is 'private'.
def request(context, flow):
    if flow.request.host.endswith("badhost.com"):
        flow.kill(context._master)
Can _master be exposed as public or there is there a way to have master default to a sensible value?
