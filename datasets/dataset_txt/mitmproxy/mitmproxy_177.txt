Could you provide me with some tips how this TCP eof error can be solved? I have tls over tcp, when I install mitmproxy on server - everything works fine with deletion of all peek(1) calls when proceeding to the next layer and setting up next layer as TCP. But when I install mitmproxy on client this solution does not work - I have no messages in tcp channel after processing tls layer which results in eof error.
Error in TCP connection to 192.168.246.135:16514: TCP connection closed unexpectedly: SysCallError(-1, 'Unexpected EOF')
