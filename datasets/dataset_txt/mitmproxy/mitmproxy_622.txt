I would love to be able to use mitmproxy whilst I am working on my local web server. The situations when I need this the most is for example when I'm offline (travelling by train home/to work), and I am running my mobile app on the simulator and have it pointed to a stubbing server which is running locally on my machine.
My server would be running on http://localhost:1338 and I am retrieving data from it to my app as expected.
However having mitmproxy running I can't figure out how to capture that traffic (local loopback) things flow through mitmproxy if I'm connected to a network.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Disconnect from your network (turn off wifi for example)
Run a web server locally (say localhost:1338) with anything on it (placeholder file will do)
Run mitmproxy
Go to the browser/whatever rest client/app and hit the localhost to retrieve the file/endpoint
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
