Steps to reproduce the problem:
run "mitmdump -w test.replay"
visit https://example.com via the proxy
stop mitmdump & cutoff web connection
run mitmdump in replay mode : "mitmdump -S test.replay"
try to access the same webpage
I obtain the following error: 502 Bad Gateway (Errno 3: Temporary failure in name resolution)
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I tried to disable the server_replay_refresh option, didn't solve it.
While replaying, wireshark shows that mitmdump still tries to connect to the remote server (which in my case fails since I'm offline).
