Hello.
I have problems with using a costum certificate since version 1.0.0 (python3).
Steps to reproduce the problem:
(I set up two virtual machines like described here.)
On VM1: Create a costum certificate like described in: "Using a custom certificate"
On VM1: Start the mitmproxy (in transparent mode) with: mitmdump -T --cert example.com=cert.pem
On VM2: And on the other virtual machine i opened a browser with the url example.com (e.g. google.com).
The given certificate was always the default certificate created with the ca certificate of the mitmproxy. Also I didn't get any error message from the mitmproxy. I tested it with Version 1.0.0, 1.0.2, 2.0.0, 2.0.1 .
When i do these steps with Version 0.18.2 (and python 2.7) everything works fine.
