I have been using mitmproxy 0.10, my goal is to use mitmproxy as a part of testing a website that has a SSL certificate by goDaddy.
However, when I try to access the website I get an SSL warning and I see that the SSL certificate is issued by mitmproxy instead of goDaddy.
When I try to use the mitmproxy in my production environment it works,
but when I use it in the staging environment it doesn't work.
The reason is probably because of a combination in the SSL in our environment and the error from the mitmproxy.
My website works with apache and mod_auth_cas.
I tried to use --cert and to insert the pem but it didn't work.
I've tried to use --cert-forward but it didn't work also, both in mitmproxy 0.10 and the version from gitHub.
Does someone know how to solve this issue?
