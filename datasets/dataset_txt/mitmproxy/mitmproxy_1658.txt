Hi,
For some reason I've yet to understand, I can't manage to compose (and send) an e-mail with an attachement on Yahoo.com webmail when using mitmproxy (I'm using it in transparent mode) - the asynchronous spinning wheel animation is running but nothing seems to happen (even when I wait for awhile). Seems like a weird RPC behavior - Gmail's attachment upload works ok.
I'm using the decb6f9 version from the master branch.
Do you have an idea of what the issue may be?
Thanks,
Yoav
