some strange magic going on here, all http requests sent to the proxy are being converted into https by the proxy. Also all https requests are failing do to some mangling of the SSL handshake, Firefox error -12263 (SSL record was too long). My config is the following:
Ubuntu 10.04
Python 2.6.5
OpenSSL 0.9.8k
Debug isn't showing nearly enough info to troubleshoot.. At this point I'm weeding through libmproxy with print statements but if you have a quicker fix let me know.
Thanks
