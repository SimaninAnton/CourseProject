At the company I work on we are developing some inline scripts to use internally.
We are struggling to create test for our scripts because the only code we found to test scripts are the ones at /mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/v0.17/test/mitmproxy/test_examples.py.
The examples are quite good but real documentation is missing for the ones who wants to unit test.
Is there another place where I can find better (maybe more advanced) test examples ?
