Mitmproxy processes all requests and parses all responses, sending them to the client when the response is complete. For big responses (e.g. streaming movies) this introduces unnecessary delays and/or timeouts.
I'd like to be able (in a script request method) to mark some requests so as the responses to them will be forwarded straight to client without parsing. They might even be not stored in the dump file.
