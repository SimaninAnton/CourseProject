Mitmproxy doesn't like loading (bad) client or server replays from the command line, as it fails to display the error.
Note that server_playback_path is called in __init__ before self.statusbar is initialized. Loading the file via the S key in mitmproxy shows the error just fine.
$ mitmproxy -S ~/Downloads/oldreplay.capture
