Hi all,
I'm having problems running mitmproxy successfully on my raspberry pi.
I've set it up this way such that I can find a certain requests which can appear randomly, however I've found that if I keep mitm continuously proxing, the requests seem to become slower and slower, until it just dies.
Just recently after getting the request I was searching for, by the time I got to the web client to view the logs, it had crashed and everything disappeared.
Is there something I'm overlooking?
