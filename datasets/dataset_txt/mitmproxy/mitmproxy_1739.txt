Our app implements SSL pinning, so mitmproxy's generated certificates aren't accepted & connections fail.
Since it's our app/API, we have all the original certificates/keys/etc. and merely want to use mitmproxy as a debugging tool. It'd be great if we could provide these & have those used rather than new ones generated.
