Steps to reproduce the problem:
Have pygtk installed
Have request flow with nulls somewhere (such as compressed post data)
Press 'E' and 'c'
Acquire exception
What is the expected behavior?
Catch the error, pokemon-style.
What went wrong?

Any other comments?
I can't actually get this to copy anything at all to the clipboard but I'm not sure who to blame yet - pyperclip seems to work in an interactive python shell but not in mitmproxy, and a previous version of pyperclip that preferred "xclip" didn't work either.
I'd prefer it if this thing didn't touch my clipboard at all, seems wrong for a console application to do that kind of thing. And this feature that sounded like it was about writing files, but #976 seems to deal with that.
