Steps to reproduce the problem:
How do I accomplish writing saved flows with mitmdump 3 on Linux, which would have been done in earlier versions with a command like this: ./mitmdump -nr infile_name -dddd --host > outfile_name
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I have looked in the --options, and I see reference to flow detail, but not the rest of the necessary options syntax
