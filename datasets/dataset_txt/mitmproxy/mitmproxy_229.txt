Steps to reproduce the problem:
Select a flow, press e to edit a URL.
flow.set @focus url str appears
This is really impractical for editing URLs. I see two approaches here:
A popup appears where the existing URL can be updated, similar to Query editing.
flow.set @focus url https://existing-url/ appears.
The same problem may also apply when editing other attributes, we should take a look.
