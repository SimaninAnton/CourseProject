Steps to reproduce the problem:
script.py:
def response(flow):
   if "customstring" in flow.response.content:
     >my code>
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
I need to use b"customstring" instead "customstring". This script was working fine on mitmproxy 0.18 but fails on mitmproxy 2.0.0
Want to use the same script because is very long and was stable on older mitm version. Any way to use strings instead bytes?
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
