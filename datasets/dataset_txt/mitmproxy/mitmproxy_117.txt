Is it possibile to make an HTTPS call to a different endpoint within the mitmproxy script?
Assumed I have like
def response(flow):
    if flow.request.pretty_host.endswith(my_host):
        res = flow.response
       if res.content:
          # http call?
it seems that the mitmproxy hangs when trying the HTTPS call within the script. I do no have to forward traffic etc., just calling a different endpoint, while keeping the flow as-it-is.
