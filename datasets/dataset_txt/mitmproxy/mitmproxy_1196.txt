Using the new Export options made available on mitmproxy 0.16 doesn't seem to work. It goes as far as providing the option to export either as a curl command, python code, or raw, but after the selection is made the prompt disappears.
No errors are evident and looking to the file system in the folder where mitmproxy was started doesn't show any new files where an exported command may have written to. Exiting mitmproxy doesn't show any errors or a stack trace.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy on the command line.
Run the following curl command in a different terminal curl --proxy localhost:8080 http://www.google.com
Back to the mitmproxy terminal, select the intercepted url and press E
The prompt Export (as curl command,as python code,as raw request)? shows up and pressing the letter c, p, or r does nothing.
What is the expected behavior?
Unsure; the feature is new and I haven't see it work correctly.
What went wrong?
No opportunity to see the exported curl command.
Any other comments?
