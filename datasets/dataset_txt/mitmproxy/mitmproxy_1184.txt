pyperclip has exuberant requirements, so I'd like to avoid installing it on my system. The mitmproxy code already handles missing pyperclip gracefully. Unfortunately, the setup script declares pyperclip as an absolute dependency, so the generated scripts (such as mitmdump) won't run without pyperclip installed. Please consider moving pyperclip from install_requires to extras_require.
