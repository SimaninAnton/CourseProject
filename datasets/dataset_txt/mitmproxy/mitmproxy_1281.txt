When I execute mitmdump 0.14 on Windows 10 (administrator mode), the program just waits. It's as if its not receiving any input. There's no errors reported. I've tried various command lines:
mitmdump
mitmdump --p 8888
mitmdump -T --host
Is there some other Windows installation step in addition to "pip install mitmproxy" and "pip install netlib"?
Can someone confirm that mitmdump works on Windows 10?
I previously had mitmdump 0.12 and 0.13 working. I think it was on Windows 10. I'm unable to drop back to a previous version of mitmdump because "pip install" keeps installing 0.14. I'm not sure how to build previous versions.
I'm running mitmproxy 0.14 on a Mac without issue.
