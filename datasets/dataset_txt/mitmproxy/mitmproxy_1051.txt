When I was getting a page on assetscdn.stackla.com through mitmdump, I got the following exception:
127.0.0.1:45960: TlsProtocolException('Cannot establish TLS with assetscdn.stackla.com:443 (sni: None): TlsException("SSL handshake error: Error([(\'SSL routines\', \'SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO\', \'sslv3 alert handshake failure\')],)",)',)
It looks like the SNI is None which raises the above exception. Is there any fix for this problem?
Mitmproxy Version: mitmdump 0.15
Operating System: Ubuntu 140.0.4
