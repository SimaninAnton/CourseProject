I was reading through the 3 complications you mention on the "How it works" page, and the following thought occurred: Can't one just rely on the SNI functionality instead of sniffing upstream certs? It seems that almost all browsers support it, so why not just listen to the SNI field, pass it on to the server, and then re-generate the returned cert (with the CN and SANs)? Wouldn't this save the need for the second connection, and the latency involved in pausing the client-side connection?
