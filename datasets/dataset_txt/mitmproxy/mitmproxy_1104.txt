mitmproxy appears to have lost its ability to modify the HTTP code of a response. I've confirmed this works correctly on 0.10.1 (Debian/jessie) and is broken on 0.17.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Create a script like so:
cat > 500.py
def response(context, flow):
flow.response.code = 500
Run mitmproxy -s 500.py
Notice that the response code of your requests isn't being modified.
What is the expected behavior?
Every request should 500.
What went wrong?
mitmproxy did not modify the HTTP code.
Any other comments?
Mitmproxy Version: 0.17 and 0.16
Operating System: OS X
