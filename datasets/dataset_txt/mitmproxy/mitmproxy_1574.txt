The serverconnect and request hooks are not called when replaying a request yet.
See #402. Quirks:
Don't add the flow to the view again (probably a simple patch to State)
Adjust Client Replay, which then only has to start the replay.
serverconnect doesn't really work, because we don't have a ConnectionHandler.
