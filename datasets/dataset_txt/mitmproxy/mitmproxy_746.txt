Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
If I use mitmproxy to read traffic from my android, certain requests will not get through (looks like they are blocked or not executed at all on the app). For example: Want to load a certain area in the app which should load a list, list will not be loaded and also not shown in mitmproxy. As soon as I stop mitmproxy and remove proxy from settings on android the request works again. Some request work but not all (especially important ones do not work). Are there any tips on how to get it to work or what the problem could be?
thanks in advance
