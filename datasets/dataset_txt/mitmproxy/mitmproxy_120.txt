Hello, I wanna to intercept the host name and based on the host name I wanna drop or continue the request ( I don't care about the content at all).
I have tried the example below:
from mitmproxy import http

def request(flow: http.HTTPFlow) -> None:
    print("sending request to"+ flow.request.pretty_host)
but I'm receiving an error: Cannot establish TLS with client so is there any way to achieve this without installing custom certs ?
