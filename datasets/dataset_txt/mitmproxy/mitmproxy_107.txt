Steps to reproduce the problem:
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8090 curl --data-binary "'test'=string" example.com
Export flow as curl command
Run the exported curl command curl -H 'Host:example.com' -H 'User-Agent:curl/7.64.0' -H 'Accept:*/*' -H 'Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive' -H 'Content-Length:13' -H 'Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -X POST 'http://example.com/' --data-binary '\'test\'=string'
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
shellcheck wiki SC1003 has more information above how to escape single quote inside single quote.
I copied its description to here.
Problematic code:
echo 'This is not how it\'s done'.
Correct code:
echo 'This is how it'\''s done'.
