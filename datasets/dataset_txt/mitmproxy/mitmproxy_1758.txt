Hey @cortesi,
tracking down the few test cases that don't work on Windows, I discovered that most of the TestHTTPS test cases don't work because of an untrusted certificate (test_clientcert, _error_post_connect, _http, _large, _replay, _sni). When I replace
ctx.set_verify(SSL.VERIFY_PEER, ver) with ctx.set_verify(SSL.VERIFY_NONE, ver) in tcp.BaseHandler.convert_to_ssl, they pass.
Before digging further down the rabbit hole - are you trusting these certs somewhere or is the observed behaviour the result of a different issue?
Cheers,
Max
