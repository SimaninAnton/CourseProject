Officially mitmproxy still claims to support pypy. However, I can't remember seeing any test runs - let alone successful ones. mitmproxy requires Python 3.5+, but pypy currently only offers a Python3.3 compatible release.
We should therefore remove pypy-related things from setup.py and .travis.yml.
