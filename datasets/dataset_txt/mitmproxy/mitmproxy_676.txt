Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
It's working fine under Chrome 57.0.2987.133 and Firefox
I was able to show the interface by playing with the answers from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31211359/ (added the meta tag from http://stackoverflow.com/a/35273628/19756 to the index.html template), but I still have some warnings in the console:
