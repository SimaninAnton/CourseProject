I cannot intercept instagram ver 10.31.0 traffic on android .
1-i used arpspoof to redirect android traffic to my laptop
2-i installed mitmproxy certificate in android
3-i can see all the traffic comming from all the other apps
I know instagram uses ssl pinning.but the wired thing is the app work just fine and it is connected to the Internet.it as if mitmproxy ignore traffic comming from instagram?
