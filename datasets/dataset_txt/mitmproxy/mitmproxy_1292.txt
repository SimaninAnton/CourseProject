HI,
i recently updated the mitmproxy in kali linux, i updated using virtualenv and it was intalled without any errors.
and the mitmproxy is working fine decrypting the SSL traffic too, but after a while it suddenly got crashed... i restarted it again.. and it works fine.. and after sometime it again crashed. here i took the screenshot.
