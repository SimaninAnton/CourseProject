Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy (console UI).
Press E to show the eventlog.
Do something to replace the entire view. For example, press ? to show help.
Press Q to go back. The eventlog is gone.
But apparently its state is still remembered somewhere, because, to show the eventlog again, I have to press E twice.
Any other comments?
I think it would be better if the eventlog stayed on screen after returning from another view. If not, at least the double-E bug should be fixed.
