Steps to reproduce the problem:
On MacOS, "edit" invokes TextWrangler from the terminal and "atom" invokes Atom. Both options work fine for opening files directly from the terminal.
After setting $EDITOR and $PAGER in .bash_profile I can trigger both external editors from mitmproxy using 'v'. However, neither option works well.
(A) using TextWrangler the contents of the body is correctly opened in TextWrangler. However, the file is read-only, making it impossible to apply JSON pretty-printing using a Text Filter without first doing a "save as".
(B) using Atom the contents of the body do not arrive in Atom. An empty file opens in Atom instead, with a similar name and in the same directory as the one opened by TextWrangler. But the content is missing.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The reason I'm doing this is because I want to examine JSON from the body of particular requests in an external editor, and being able to pretty-print them easily (e.g. using the Beautify package for Atom) is key to being able to scan through the JSON quickly.
