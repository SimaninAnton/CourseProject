I am trying to install mitmproxy by: sudo pip install mitmproxy
Getting error:
 mitmproxy --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/mitmproxy", line 7, in <module>
    from mitmproxy.main import mitmproxy
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/main.py", line 5, in <module>
    from six.moves import _thread  # PY3: We only need _thread.error, which is an alias of RuntimeError in 3.3+
ImportError: cannot import name _thread
OS: OSX 10.10.5

Tried to remove this error but did not get access.
