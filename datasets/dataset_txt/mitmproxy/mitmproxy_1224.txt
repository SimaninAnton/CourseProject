Good morning,
I fetch the newest updates of mitmproxy every couple of days, but yesterday night, I discovered the following error I never got before - is there anybody seeing the same issue or might it just be related to my own setup?
The installation went fine:
$ sudo pip install mitmproxy/ --upgrade
[...]
Installing collected packages: mitmproxy
Found existing installation: mitmproxy 0.15
Uninstalling mitmproxy:
Successfully uninstalled mitmproxy
Running setup.py install for mitmproxy
[...]
Installing mitmdump script to /usr/local/bin
Successfully installed mitmproxy
Cleaning up...
But then:
$ mitmproxy
Traceback (most recent call last):
