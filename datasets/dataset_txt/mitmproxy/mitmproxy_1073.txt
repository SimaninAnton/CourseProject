Headers like Content-Length should preserve case after going trough mitmproxy, because some versions of PHP don't like lowercase headers (this is a server-side misimplementation of RFC 2616, but it would be nice if mitmproxy was able to handle this.).
Steps to reproduce:
Capture some traffic, replay it with mitmdump -nc capture_file. Everything works as intended.
Now replay it, but use a script that replaces the request content. The Content-Length header get's changed to content-lenght.
The problem probably lies at netlib/http/message.py
