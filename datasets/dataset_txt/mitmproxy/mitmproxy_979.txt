I'm currently dealing with an app that has very looooong urls (see screenshots.)
This makes the UI look crappy. I understand that there's not much we can do in cases in like these.
But having an option to only view part of the URL, such as everything but the query string, or only the first 100 characters etc. in the flowlist, and then showing the entire URL when user presses a key (in the flowview) would be nice.
