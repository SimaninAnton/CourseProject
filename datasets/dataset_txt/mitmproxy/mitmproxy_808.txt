Hello,
I have setup the following environment. I have a dns proxy server and mitmproxy sitting on one machine. The device(whose traffic is to be captured)'s DNS server is set to my own DNS server. There I spoof all IP addresses to return the (public ip)address of mitmproxy.
I run mitmproxy as such
mitmproxy -T --host
When I attempt to visit a website, I get this
So I see that mitmproxy correctly identified the domain it should connect to, however in the redacted part, the IP mitmproxy connects to is the proxy machine itself. So what can I do here so that it connects to the real domain?
