Steps to reproduce the problem:
I'm using mitmproxy/mitmdump for http debugging and save responses as har file.
I've used below command through terminal and it works fine
mitmdump -b <host> -p <port> -s "~/mitmproxy-0.17/examples/har_extractor.py ./result_file"
But when I tried to run this background by using '&' at the end, command is working but file not saved.
mitmdump -b <host> -p <port> -s "~/mitmproxy-0.17/examples/har_extractor.py ./result_file" &
What is the expected behavior?
I need to Start mitmproxy in background
Capture the traffic
Save as har file
Stop mitmproxy (Kill process)
And I need to run these steps through ruby script. I'm calling shell commands in ruby script.
What went wrong?
Not able to save file when run in background.
Unable to Kill process when run in foreground
Mitmproxy Version: mitmproxy 0.17
Operating System: MAC OSX EI Capitan (10.11.2)
