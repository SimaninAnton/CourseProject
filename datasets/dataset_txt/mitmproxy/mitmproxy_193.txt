Hi!
I'm trying to log certain information based on the contents of a websocket message. The default log level is "Info", which means that every time a websocket message is received either by the client or the server, the following message is presented in the EventLog panel:
info: 192.168.1.54:59672 <- WebSocket 1 message <- "server address"
A lot of websocket messages are sent between client and server, so the EventLog gets filled with this info level logs. To avoid it, I can lower the log level to "warn" or "error" and use ctx.log.warn or ctx.log.error in my script to print the logs I'm interested in. This workaround is, although functional, a bit cumbersome and impractical (my script logs will be in red and merged with real errors and warnings).
Is there a way to suppress default "info" logging done by mitm? If not, is there a way to create a custom log level, and then filter the EventLog with the newly created level so that EventLog only displays my logs?
Thanks in advance!
