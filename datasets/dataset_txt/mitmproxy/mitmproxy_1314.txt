I try to keep it short.
Up to version 0.13 I was used that mitmdump tells me when a site was replayed with a line include << and [replay]. If the site was not replayed but loaded from the original server than it printed something with << but without [replay]. But this was not done with the master version from yesterday. Thus it was harder to find #774.
The output from mitmdump was moved to click instead of print, I think. After a search I found out that the handle_request function of dump.py is the point of my ambition. It response on a request but did not print anything. Thus I added the line
self.echo_flow(f)
after f.reply() and the replay output is back.
I think this is a bug and that it affects the option -d, too. If neither is true, I'm sorry for this report.
