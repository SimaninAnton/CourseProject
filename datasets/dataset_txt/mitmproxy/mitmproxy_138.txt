Steps to reproduce the problem:
Create addon that import datetime
date should be value lower than 86400
datetime.fromtimestamp(date)
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Just change the value to 86400
The issue comes from python sdk, to solve this mitmproxy must upgrade to python 3.7 or later
