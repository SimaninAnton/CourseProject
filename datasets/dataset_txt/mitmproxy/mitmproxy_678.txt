This issue tracks all roadblocks we need to overcome to make use of Python 3.6-exclusive features. There's not immediate need to upgrade right away, but it's useful to have an overview of what's left nonetheless.
Windows
Windows users can just install Python 3.6
Windows Subsystem for Linux currently contains Ubuntu 16.04, but a do-release-upgrade can be used without problems
macOS
High Sierra only has Python 2.7.10 and no Python 3
Homebrew is already on Python 3.6.3
Ubuntu
Bionic 18.04 (next LTS release in April 2018) will have Python 3.6.3 (or a more recent patch-level)
Artful 17.10 has Python 3.6.3
Zesty 17.04 has Python 3.5.3
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is still on 3.5.1
Debian
testing: Debian 10 (buster) currently contains Python 3.6.3 -- no release date yet
stable: Debian 9 (stretch) is still on 3.5.3
Arch Linux
rolling release: has Python 3.6.3 as python package
Fedora
Fedora 27 has Python 3.6.3
Fedora 26 has Python 3.6.3
Fedora 25 has Python 3.5.4
Kali Linux
kali-roll has Python 3.6.3 -- rolling release since January 2016
kali-dev has Python 3.6.3
PyInstaller
PyInstaller supports Python 3.6 since PyInstaller 3.3. We still have to upgrade to PyInstaller 3.3. Updating to PyInstaller 3.3.0 ends with a RecursionError within PyInstaller.
