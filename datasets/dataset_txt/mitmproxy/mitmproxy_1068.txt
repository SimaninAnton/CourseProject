Steps to reproduce the problem:
run a mitimdump with the new debug functionality that may or may not be merged by the time you look at this
Fire up a browser going through mitmdump, and visit our old nemesis: https://http2.akamai.com/demo
Exit the browser
Send a SIGUSR1 to mitmdump to trigger debug output pkill -SIGUSR1 -f mitmdump
What is the expected behavior?
I expect no HTTP service threads to remain.
What went wrong?
Many HTTP service threads remain.
