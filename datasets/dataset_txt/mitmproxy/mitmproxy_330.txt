Steps to reproduce the problem:
Attempt to proxy an SSL session over HTTP2
See that connection is dropped
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The server is only requiring self-signed certificates installed on the client, so it really not a certificate issue. Is it possible the stream of data is too fast for a proxy interruption?
