I have 2 machines (A and B), which can talk directly with each other because they are in the same VLAN. I put my proxy in B, where I have a simple docker container running (ports 8070 and 8448). I put my transparent proxy in front of these port numbers because I want to catch the network traffic through this port. I also config my iptable to listen to any incoming package comes to these ports and forwarding to my proxy. However, when I do the request from A to B, it goes direct to my docker container's port instead of forwarding it to my proxy. Does anyone have ideas about what is going on?
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Follow these step https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/
mitmproy --m transparent -p $PORTNUMBER
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I tried to use "traceroute" but I can't get anything.
