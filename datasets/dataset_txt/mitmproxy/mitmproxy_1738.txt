I tried downgrading from mitmproxy 0.9.2 to 0.9 while trying to work around the issue described here (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mitmproxy/ozc17WOG_OI). However I hit the error below. Uninstalling netlib and installing netlib 0.9 fixed this. It looks like netlib 0.9.2 may have dropped a parameter and broken backward compatibility.
% mitmproxy
Traceback (most recent call last):

This may also be the root cause of #167.
