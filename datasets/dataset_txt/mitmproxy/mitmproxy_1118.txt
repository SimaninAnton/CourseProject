Steps to reproduce the problem:
Visit http://mitm.it/ direct.
Click "Visit the Documentation" link.
Arrive at https://mitmproxy.org/doc/index.html which is a 404
I don't know whether the source for mitm.it is available.
What is the expected behavior?
Link to http://docs.mitmproxy.org
What went wrong?
Probably docs moved.
Any other comments?
Great product.
