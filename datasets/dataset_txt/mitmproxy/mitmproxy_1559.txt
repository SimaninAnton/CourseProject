when mitmproxy opens, there is no request
then I want to issue a new request to the server to see how server responses
this seems can't be done
(why not set proxy and use curl ...)
because mitmproxy has a nice editor ...
(why I want this)
I think it's a valuable feature, sometimes you just want to provoke the server to see how
it responses, maybe try to squeeze some ajax api out of it, testing some variables
and the easy way is to make a new request instead of curl/browser/...
what I want:
could someone tell me is there a way to make new request right inside mitmproxy?
(I think it should have one, maybe I missed it?)
if not, could you add a shortcut "n" at main screen to start make and edit a new request?
