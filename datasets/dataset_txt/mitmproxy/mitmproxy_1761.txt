I'm trying to import cert in firefox 23.0
doing everything like here: http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/firefox.html
in section "Click "View Certificates", "Import", and select the certificate file:"
after selecting file mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem nothing happens
file choose dialog disappears and I see list of CA's again, mitmproxy not there
tried also to import into "Your certificates" there - but here I'm choosing .p12 file instead of .pem, dialog asks password and after empty password gives error:
"Failed to decode the file. Either it is not in PKCS #12 format, has been corrupted, or the password you entered was incorrect."
all this on os x 10.8.4
also tried on windows - same problem
uploaded pem file here https://www.dropbox.com/s/v68aiymbe7voiqm/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
what am I doing wrong?
