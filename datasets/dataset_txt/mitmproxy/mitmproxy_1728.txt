Issue 109 contains reports from users that the problem still exists after the issue was closed.
I'm also experiencing this issue on Ubuntu 13.10 with mitmproxy 0.8 and Python 2.7.5+.
I suspect that this issue is no longer actively monitored now that it is closed, despite subsequent comments indicating that it is not resolved. Accordingly, I'll do the in-your-face thing of opening a separate issue pointing to this one and then hope for the author's eventual forgiveness.
