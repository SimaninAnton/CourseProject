Steps to reproduce the problem:
Add a config.yaml file include view_filter: google
run mitmproxy
got error mitmproxy: Error reading /Users/Shayne/.mitmproxy/config.yaml: 'No such option: view_filter'
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The option is in the source I don't know why it's not in the latest release
