I'm using mitmproxy to proxy HTTP (80) traffic only on Mac OSX. After vigorously clicking around for a few minutes on BBC.co.uk, cnn.com and nytimes.com (generating beween 500-1000 requests), I start getting connection timeouts from mitmproxy.
Have followed @limeric29 's steps from #375 ie:
I updated both netlib and mitmproxy using these commands:
pip uninstall netlib
pip uninstall mitmproxy
pip install git+https://github.com/mitmproxy/netlib.git@master
pip install git+https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy.git@master
My lsof -n -p PID output is: http://pastebin.com/tGAREXbp

Please fix - as mitmproxy looks generally awesomely designed and documented, but I can't use this in anger if it effectively grinds to a halt after a few minutes of execution!
