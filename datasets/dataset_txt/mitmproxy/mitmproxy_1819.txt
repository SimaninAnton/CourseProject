Hi cortesi,
mitmproxy currently uses the deprecated optparse for handling console argument parsing. Would you welcome a patch that replaces optparse with argparse or are there any special reasons for sticking with optparse?
I am asking because we'd love to have support for argument files in HoneyProxy.
Thanks!
Max
