In my company users use proxy.
But I need to split the flow by usernames. for each user - own traffic log.
Sorry but I can't figure out how to do that. Is it possible?
I have
Using docker latest image.
Proxy works fine with proxyauth option enabled.
http and https work fine.
but no meta data in requests details (using mitmweb)
As idea want to write add-on. But I'm not sure it's possible.
Thank you!
