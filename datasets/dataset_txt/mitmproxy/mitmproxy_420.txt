Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump -p 9999
on the same machine:
2.curl http://localhost:9999
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I get the "127.0.0.1:60422: HTTP protocol error in client request: Invalid HTTP request form (expected: authority or absolute, got: relative)" error,
when running with the -T option i get the following error:
"127.0.0.1:60420: Transparent mode failure: OSError(92, 'Protocol not available')"
in mitmdump version 0.15 the same configuration and script with the -T option seems to work.
