Hey there!
I tried to install mitmproxy to test it with my firefoy and my ios device.
But after my installation of python and urwid (via macports) the gui of mitmproxy is still blank.
I googled and tried the following instructions: http://r00tsec.blogspot.com/2011/04/howto-installation-mitmproxy.html
But without success...
Do I have to initiate the SSL connection in a special way?
Thanks for help!
