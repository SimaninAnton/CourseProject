First of all thanks for the great piece of software. Makes reverse proxying so easy while testing dev environments.
I am proxying a java application which uses jetty web server. I would like mitmproxy to rewrite my cookie path. So if the path of the java application is /dev and of the reverse proxy to be / I'd want this to be implcitly handled by mitmproxy like apache does. Is this already possible, did I miss an option? If not how could it be implemented?
