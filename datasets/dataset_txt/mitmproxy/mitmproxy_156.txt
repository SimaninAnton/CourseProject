Add an option to run in background as service like as postgresql binaries using pg_ctl. From ssh access run the pg_ctl with run arguments and the pg service run in background without current shell session.
Example: mitmdump [options...] --service start
And save the pid file in current directory for multiple instances or declare manualy, example: mitmdump [options...] --service start --pid-file ./instance-website.com.pid
