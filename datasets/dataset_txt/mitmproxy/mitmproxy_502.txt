Open the attached flow dump in mitmproxy console. When viewing the content, observe the traceback that flashes to screen. A number of issues here:
Kaitai should be able to parse this gif. It's not technically correct, but I've seen this often, especially with single-pixel tracking gifs.
Even if Kaitai fails, we shouldn't crash - the user should see an "invalid image" message (or something more informative). (#2698)
Even if we crash, the traceback shouldn't be flashed to screen and disappear. This is an issue with the way we handle super-long error events in console. (#2699)
