Connect to vpn (this is palo alot)
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Sorry that this is not an issue with mitmproxy per say, but I could use a little help. When I connect to my corporate VPN mitm-proxy stops intercepting traffic. I understand that when I connect to my corporate VPN my internal routing table on my workstation changes, and the default gateway may change also. However what I can't understand is that my (osx) system proxy settings are still sending everything to localhost:8080 where mitm proxy is still listening. I see no requests making it's way through it. I tried googling OSX related articles, but no luck. Making this ticket as last ditch effort.
