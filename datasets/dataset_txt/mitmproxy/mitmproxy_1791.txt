Sorry if this is a terrible issue report. I'm new
Onto the problem...
I finally got mitmproxy working, the GUI was up and all, and I wanted to use my iPhone (iOS 6.1.2, model 4, jailbroken), the certificate was installed, the port and IP was in, and i started up mitmproxy, typed in nothing, and opened chrome and then instantly this error showed up:
File "/usr/local/bin/mitmproxy", line 64, in <module> m.run() File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/console/__init__.py", line 538, in run self.ui.run_wrapper(self.loop) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-1.3.1-py2.7.egg/urwid/raw_display.py", line 242, in run_wrapper return fn() File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/console/__init__.py", line 747, in loop changed = self.tick(self.masterq) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/flow.py", line 1421, in tick return controller.Master.tick(self, q) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/controller.py", line 77, in tick self.handle(msg) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/controller.py", line 95, in handle m(msg) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/flow.py", line 1499, in handle_clientconnect self.add_event("Connect from: %s:%s"%cc.address) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/console/__init__.py", line 948, in add_event self.eventlist.set_focus(len(self.eventlist)) File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-1.3.1-py2.7.egg/urwid/listbox.py", line 178, in set_focus raise IndexError, "No widget at position %s" % (position,) IndexError: No widget at position 1
I searched around here and found that typing pip install urwid==1.0.2 does downgrade to 1.0.2, and i even uninstalled 1.1.1, but still get the crash.
P.S. - I did the downgrading/uninstalling of urwid on the root user. Maybe I have to restart my computer and login as regular user? I will try that and post result. EDIT On my regular user after restarting my computer and still got the error as soon as.
