Is there a way to save the SSL keys in a form for wireshark ("(Pre)-Master-Secret")? If not is it possible to add such functionality?
For example I get an "invalid header" or "Gateway Timeout" error for some SSL sites by using mitmdump. Without mitmdump everything works ok. Without seeing both request, the original one and the one used by mitmdump it is difficult to find the problem.
