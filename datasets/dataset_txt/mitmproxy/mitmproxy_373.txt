As discussed with @cortesi on slack, right now whenever a user's script throws an error due to various reasons, it is being handled at different places differently.
Therefore we can have a consistent error handler function which can be invoked whenever there is an error
This will also handle #2837 #2838 #2839
Function
Signature
script_error(path, message, lineno, exception)
What function will do
"Error in script XXX:NNN MMM‚Äù where XXX is the path as specified by the user (the .path attribute of Script), NNN is a line number if we have one, and MMM is a short message
The idea here is to display the above mentioned message in the console app and display the traceback related to the error in the event log.
