Screenshot:
Running mac OSX 10.8.5, and trunk for pathod, netlib, and mitmproxy. Observed behavior using Firefox 24.
start up mitmproxy from the command line
browse to https://twitter.com in Firefox 24, observe bad issuer chain cert error. Other secure twitter urls don't seem to be affected.
As an example of a url that isn't affected, browse to https://2012.twitter.com
I was not able to reproduce this issue using Chrome and mitmproxy.
