Hi,
I am building a tool to benchmark different mitm proxies. On initial runs, I am seeing difference between the performance of mitmproxy and mitmdump (v3.0.3).
You can find the entire report here: https://github.com/pulkitsharma07/proxybench#reporting
For the HTTPS Stress (over HTTP/2) test, which opens https://www.httpvshttps.com/, mitmproxy is 5 times slower than mitmdump. In other benchmarks too mitmproxy is slower than mitmdump.
I need to understand, am I doing something wrong on my end ? or is this an expected behaviour ?
I am launching both proxies similarly with the --listen-port argument.
Thanks.
