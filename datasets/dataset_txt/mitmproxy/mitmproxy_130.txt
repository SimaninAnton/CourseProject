Steps to reproduce the problem:
I have no Problem. Just a question/ask for advice
Could you brilliant people please point on the right direction of how to achieve this:
Run a mitm proxy on my computer(Client) -> Intercept all requests -> Send all requests as text(Via email/chat) -> Receive the message on my server(Server) which runs a second mitm proxy -> Text the message and pass it as a request to mitm proxy on Server to complete the request->Send response back as text(Email/Chat) back to Client
How can I script mitm proxy to achieve this?
