Assuming someone starts mitmproxy in reverse proxy mode with recorded flows, e.g.
mitmproxy -r recorded_flows -R http://127.0.0.1:80
How do we react to replays? Do we send them to the original server or do we send them to the reverse proxy?
Assuming someone starts mitmproxy in upstream proxy mode with recorded flows, e.g.
mitmproxy -r recorded_flows -U http://127.0.0.1:8080
How do we react to replays? Do we send them to the original server or do we send them to the upstream proxy?
