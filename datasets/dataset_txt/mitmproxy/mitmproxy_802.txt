Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmweb
In one of the "Start" boxes, start to type each of the filter expressions. e.g. "~b asdf"
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I realize that mitmweb is beta, but the documentation indicates "We consider it stable for all features currently exposed in the UI", so maybe this is an oversight. Filter expressions that cause the error: "SyntaxError: Expected filter expression but "~" found" include:
~b
~bq
~bs
~dst
~http
~marked
~src
