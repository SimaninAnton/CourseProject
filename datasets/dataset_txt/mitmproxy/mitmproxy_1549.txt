I was testing mitmproxy. I hit the d key and it crashed:

Shutting down...
Background
I was trying to clear the flow list by hitting C. Some flows were cleared but the others remained there. I typed ? and looked at the flow deleting key. I typed q to return back to main screen and hit d after going to the last flow on my screen. After that, BOOM! It crashed!
If you need any more information just let me know.
