Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install mitmproxy on ubuntu on windows 10
run mitmdump
What is the expected behavior?
mitmdump runs
What went wrong?
mitmdump crashes because inotify is not supported on ubuntu on windows 10
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I set use_relader=False in mitmdump.py to fix this for myself.
