A new release is long overdue, so let's cut one!
Write the CHANGELOG. One basically needs to go through the commit list and write out all new features from a user perspective. Do we have any volunteers for that? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqEXRSD_YNWNLLNK5ir689wH6bBgPEsxujx0EFvt2cY/
Figure out what's the current state of the session addon? Can we ship this or defer? @cortesi? @madt1m?
Ideally get through the issues linked in https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/milestone/20. No problem if we don't, we definitely do want to increase release frequency.
Compile mitmweb from source and push the updated minified JS.
Finally, cut the release. @mhils will take care of this to check if the new CI handles it well.
