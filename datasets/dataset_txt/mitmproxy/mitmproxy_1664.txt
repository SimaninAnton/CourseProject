Hi,
When using the -s option of mitmproxy 0.10.1, if a space is present in the script's path, mitmproxy gives this error, even when using quotes around the path:
# mitmproxy -s "/path with spaces/script.py"
Script load error: Command not found.
It used to work in mitmproxy 0.9.2 and the problem doesn't exist with the -w parameter for example.
Using "\ " instead of spaces works.
