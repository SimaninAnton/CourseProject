We currently link to a bunch of external places at http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/certinstall.html. Unfortunately, we had a bunch of cases where those links went dead and we didn't notice quickly. What's more, the instructions we link to are rather complicated sometimes. It would be nice if we could slowly start providing our own docs for this again, given that this is a rather important aspect needed to make mitmproxy work.
