I use mitmproxy a lot for developing scripts that scrap external content. I often find that it takes a long time to test script because it needs to repeat all the HTTP requests. It would be nice if it was able to select HTTP requests that mitmproxy would cache and use cached version to reply to the user.
The most common use case scenario is GET requests because those are supposed to be immutable.
I have built a node web-proxy script to do this for me, using it as a forward proxy together with mitmproxy, though it would be nice if mitmproxy supported this natively.
