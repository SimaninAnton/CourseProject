Steps to reproduce the problem:
I am trying to intercept packets of my android phone on an ubuntu 16 machine. All the http:// traffic is intercepted but https:// traffic is Not. It is not even in the event logs. I think it is not recognizing the https traffic. Any ides how to resolve this issue ?
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Done updating pypy-pyasn1 but the issue persists.
