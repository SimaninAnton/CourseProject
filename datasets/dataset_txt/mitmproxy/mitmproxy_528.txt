Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run mitmproxy and start intercepting flows.
Let the UI fill with flows and then goto the last flow.
Press up key to go one flow above.
The UI shifts one flow downwards instead of marker going one flow upwards.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This is not a deal breaker or anything but a bit annoying. This seems to happen only with the last flow in UI.
