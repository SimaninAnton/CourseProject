I'm having the same symptom as #203 in an older Android emulator, SDK 10 (2.3.3). I can't get mitm.it to come up in the system browser, so I can't install the certificate that way. Instead, I installed the certificate into the emulator's /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks by this method. I've verified that the certificate is still in that file after the emulator reboots, using keystore -list | grep.
In the LogCat:
