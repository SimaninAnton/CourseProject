Hello Everyone,
Currently we can edit request body, and while doing so it opens up vi(editor) with original body.
There are many times, when I need to delete all contents in body, paste new contents in body.
What about having a new option like, 'new-request-body' where it opens up blank vi(editor) and i just paste the new body that i want.
I had first posted it on the forum also,

If sounds foolish, please close the issue, if sounds good then we can discuses more.
