Steps to reproduce the problem:
Followed the steps in mitmproxy.org to install mitmproxy and cert
config firefox + autoproxy by adding a new proxy "mitmproxy 127.0.0.0 8080"
start mitmproxy: mitmproxy -p 8080
on firefox, browse a website "http://baidu.com"
What is the expected behavior?
suppose to see the network flow
What went wrong?
mitmproxy console has NO output at all.
Any other comments?
Also tried all other command lines, i.e. "mitmproxy -R xxx", nothing works for me. I never see mitmproxy catching anything.
Please advice and help!
Mitmproxy Version: 0.16
Operating System: mac
