First thing is very simple, when im using mitmproxy, command like:mitmproxy -T —port 8081 —replace :~s:content:replace is not working.I replaced the word "content",restarted mitmproxy many times, but nothing has changed.
Second thing.
When im using option --replace-from-file with regex <script((?!<script).|\n)*?to\x3A.*?\x22(.*?)\x22(.|\n)*?new\s(.|\n)*?</script> websites that use http protocol do not work.
And some https websites to...when im trying to access to yandex.ru for example.
But in this case,i do not have redirect to https://yandex.ru/
When I delete a regular expression, it works.
