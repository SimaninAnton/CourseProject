Followed the steps and different config in the org website, but didn't see any network flow caught.
Another example from the website:
config firefox + autoproxy by adding a new proxy "mitmproxy 127.0.0.0 9001"
start mitmproxy: mitmproxy -p 9001
on firefox, browse a website "http://baidu.com"
Also tried all other command lines, i.e. "mitmproxy -R xxx", nothing works for me. I never see mitmproxy catching anything. Please advice and help!
Mitmproxy Version: 0.16
Operating System: mac
