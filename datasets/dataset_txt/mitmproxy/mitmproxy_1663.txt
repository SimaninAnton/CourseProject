I've been struggling to get a regex to work, and finally realised what is going on.
Somewhere, the html is being rewritten.
from http://forums.theregister.co.uk/post/reply/2225552
this snippet in the source:
                     <div>
                        <textarea name=body id=body cols=60 rows=10 class="discussion" tabindex=6></textarea>
                    </div>
is being displayed in mitmproxy as:
<div>
     <textarea name="body" id="body" cols="60" rows="10" class="discussion" tabindex="6"/></div>
It seems something is cleaning the html, but this make it damn awkward for debugging!
Thoughts?
