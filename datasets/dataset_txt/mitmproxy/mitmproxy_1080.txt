Steps to reproduce the problem:
curl -v -X POST --data "@data.json" http://example.com -x 127.0.0.1:8080
the data.json is like this,
{
 "abc": false,
}
Export python code
the python code is like this
json = {
"abc": false,
}

response = requests.request(
method='POST',
url=url,
headers=headers,
json=json,
)

print(response.text)
What is the expected behavior?
json = {
    "abc": 'false',
}

response = requests.request(
    method='POST',
    url=url,
    headers=headers,
    json=json,
)

print(response.text)
What went wrong?
Maybe the export code has bug
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
