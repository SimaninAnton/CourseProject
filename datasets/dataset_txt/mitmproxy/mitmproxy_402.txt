As noticed by @PaleNeutron in #2874, every contentview currently defines a hotkey, which however does not seem to be used anywhere:
In the script, prompt = ("swap case text", "Z") seems defined hotkey Z, but this one also not work.
We used to have these hotkeys to select a contentview when pressing m while viewing a flow, but we use console.choose there now, which doesn't have/need that. We need to:
Find out if those contentview prompts are still used anywhere.
If not, remove them.
