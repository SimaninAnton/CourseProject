Taken from the GSoC 2017 ideas page, because this should really be an issue here.
We currently depend on the watchdog library to watch the filesystem and reload mitmproxy scripts automatically. Due to numerous bugs in watchdog, we have restricted ourselves to using only watchdogs's PollingObserver over time. Watchdog now is a large dependency with platform-specific binary components and multiple subdependencies which we do not really use, so we want reimplement the very small subset that is needed for mitmproxy in pure Python. This makes mitmproxy smaller and we don't have to worry about watchdog breaking mitmproxy installations anymore.
