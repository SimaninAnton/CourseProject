Hello,
I am trying to access fairly large mp3 file using http-get method.
Description of response method says that call-back will happen when server response has been received.
So my question is, will callback happen as soon as response to http-get is received (beginning of mp3 transfer) or after last byte of mp3 file has been transferred.
def response(context, flow):
"""
Called when a server response has been received.
"""
context.log("response")
P.S: I am not sure whether this is right place to put query or not, if not sorry for the mess.
