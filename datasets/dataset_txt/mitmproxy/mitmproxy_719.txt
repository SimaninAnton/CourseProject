I'm currently running an issue where I read a saved flow file and I need to match flows to HTTP connections.
The intuitive way to do this would be to compare f.client_conn == f2.client_conn, which holds true for live connections but not for saved ones, because each flow has its own distinct ClientConnection object. Possible ways to fix this:
Add __eq__ implementation to ClientConnection (either by checking ip tuples + timestamp or by adding a unique id)
Enhance FlowReader to re-use ClientConnections. I don't like this, but that would be more consistent with the live behavior.
???
The same problem applies to ServerConnections.
@mitmproxy/devs: thoughts?
