Hi Max,
maybe you can give me a hand regarding this tricky one:
I use a website which contains encrypted content. It tells me to upload my private key in order to decrypt the content server-side, but I do not want to expose my private key. What I want to do instead is the following:
Invoke the specific website address, e.g. https://example.com/view.php?msg=15
extract token ID etc. from the request content (this works already) to create the request for step 3.
In the background, request the raw source of the encrypted content (in a separate request, this works already)
Decrypt this source with my private key (this also works already)
Paste the result of step 4 in such a way that I see it inside the response of step 1.
So, my crucial step is no. 3. How can I perform a request in the background and then "inject" its response into the response of the originating request in step 1? The rest is feasible for me.
Kind regards
Gordon
