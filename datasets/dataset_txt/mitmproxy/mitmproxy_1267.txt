I used mitmproxy to analyze an API that an internet radio device interacts with. The server responded with sort-of-XML data, but a content-type: text/html header.
mitmproxy used that header to switch to HTML response display mode, lowercasing all XML tags and adding a fsckng doctype header to the output.
I did not know that mitmproxy tampered with the data I saw and wondered for days why my API replication did not work with the device.
Please please please:
switch to raw mode by default, or at least provide a parameter for this
do not add a DOCTYPE line to the responses of html. please. Do not add additional data that were not in the original response.
