Sometimes the URL might be very long, e.g.
https://foo.com/mobile/user/2014_11_04?method=get&path=%5B%22shows%22%2C%5B%2270140556%22%2C%2270145656%22%2C%2270171942%22%2C%2270176217%22%2C%2270160567%22%2C%2270264666%22%2C%2270505665%22%5D%2C%5B%22bookmark%22%2C%22interestingMomentsAll%22%2C%22thumbnailStill%22%5D%5D&path=%5B%22movies%22%2C%2260004476%22%2C%5B%22bookmark%22%2C%22interestingMomentsAll%22%2C%22thumbnailStill%22%5D%5D&path=%5B%22movies%22%2C%2270115554%22%2C%5B%22bookmark%22%2C%22interestingMomentsAll%22%2C%22pinProtection%22%2C%22rating%22%2C%22thumbnailStill%22%5D%5D&path=%5B%22movies%22%2C%2270026697%22%2C%5B%22bookmark%22%2C%22interestingMomentsAll%22%2C%22thumbnailStill%22%5D%5D&country=GB&esn=NFAPPL-02-IPHONE7=1-6BA4505AEE94C292946D4601110559A1F1A55C6CB6BCAF29E05456F67C666426&languages=en-GB%2Cen%2Cen-US&v=2.0&output=json&routing=reject&materialize=true&phablet=true&uuid=NFAPPL-02-IPHONE7%5D1-6BA4505AEE94C292946D4601110559A1F1A55C6CB6BCAF29E05456F67C666426_BQAtAAEBEI6BVSq9l_IAt19KXRjNsstAvgGpbAoZn6VEqTE5LkSGLT190ibkcOdxLlTttsYrPY15xBpbWbmIiG16TefWn6CkLYccqmHzXH0g2xHqewXcCQ.._1422560715519_1422560717461&model=saget&bb2=1&bb_logo=1&snacks=1&withCredentials=true
There are several problems with the way URL is displayed:
URL encoded (hard to read).
Because of the indenting, copied URL contains whitespaces.
It would be nice to have an option that would display URL without indenting and URL decoded.
Alternatively, being able to get the URL to clipboard would be nice.
