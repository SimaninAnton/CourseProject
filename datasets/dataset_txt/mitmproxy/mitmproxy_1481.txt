Thanks for this awesome tool.
Something that would make it much more usable is these few key features of less (not the css pre-processor )
Namely:
shift + . or g to navigate to the end of the list
shift + , or shift + g to navigate to the start of the list
shift + f to start following the list (auto scrolling) and then ctrl + c to cancel
/ and shift + / to search forwards and backwards respectively
