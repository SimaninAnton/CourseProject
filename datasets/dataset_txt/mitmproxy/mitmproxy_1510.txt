I spend a lot of time developing a mobile application against an API, and most of the time my phone is going through mitmproxy.
It would be great if each request showed how milliseconds (or seconds, yikes!) it took each request to come back from the server, so that I could easily keep track of which API endpoints need some optimization attention.
e.g. instead of this:
POST https://p09-ckdatabase.icloud.com/api/client/user/quota
← 200 application/x-protobuf 78B 39.28kB/s
it would look something like this:
POST https://p09-ckdatabase.icloud.com/api/client/user/quota
← 200 application/x-protobuf 78B 39.28kB/s (237ms)
or this:
POST https://p09-ckdatabase.icloud.com/api/client/user/quota
← 200 application/x-protobuf 78B 39.28kB/s (1.32s)
or this:
POST https://p09-ckdatabase.icloud.com/api/client/user/quota
← 200 application/x-protobuf 78B 39.28kB/s (27.9s)
(i.e. three significant digits would be great)
