Steps to reproduce the problem:
Open request to a URL with query - you should see the query content view:
Edit some parts of the query by pressing e, q.
What is the expected behavior?
The UI should show the updated query.
What went wrong?
The old query value is cached. After changing the display mode twice, the new value is displayed.
