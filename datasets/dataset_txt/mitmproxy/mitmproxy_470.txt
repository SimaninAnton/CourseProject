The title explains the error I receive when trying to run the command
mitmproxy -T --host -port 8080
Looking at the Traceback it's pointing to the tls-parser.py file line 8, then provides
from construct import (Array, Bytes, Struct, UBInt16, UBInt32, UBInt8, PascalString, Embed, TunnelAdapter, GreedyRange, Switch, OptionalGreedyRange, Optional)
Is this a bug or is there something I can do to fix this issue myself?
