I am saving the output of mitmdump in a file as a log file. If an error occurs it could help finding it. But after some hours it is a problem to know which line is of interest. Thus I asked for a way to optionally add a time or date and time at the beginning of every output line.
Up to now I modify add_event of dump.py but this only modifies some of the line, which is still better than nothing.
