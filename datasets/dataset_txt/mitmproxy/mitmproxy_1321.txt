I have some issue with MacOS X 10.10.5 / iOS9.0 GM.
The python script starts with no errors, but it seems the device is not connecting to the proxy (I can see no logs on the Mac). On the iPhone the error is
Sep 16 11:20:05 iPhone6Loreto[1671] <Error>: tcp_connection_destination_perform_socket_connect 125 connectx to 192.168.2.188:11112@0 failed: [64] Host is down
If I do telnet locally
macbookproloreto:~ admin$ telnet 192.168.2.188 11112
Trying 192.168.2.188...

This happens on WiFi interface only. Using Ethernet it works fine.
