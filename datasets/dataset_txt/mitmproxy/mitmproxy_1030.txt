Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install certificate from mitm.it in Firefox (Other option with websites checked)
start in socks mode mitmproxy -p 8888 --socks
Try to login in gmail
What is the expected behavior?
Successful login
What went wrong?
Gmail fails with "Invalid requests"
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Setting up socks proxy using ssh command works correctly: ssh -f -N -D 0.0.0.0:8888 localhost
Mitmproxy Version: 0.17
Operating System: ubuntu 16.04
