I've tried to install mitmproxy from the GitHub repo, mitmdump and mitmweb worked perfectly, but not mitmproxy. mitmproxy runs but doesn't show any traffic captured whatsoever.
After running wireshark and analyzing the traffic, I saw the GET request with destination port of 8080 heading towards mitmproxy, but no response is captured by wireshark (captured on any interface and loopback with no luck).
I've installed it using the tutorial provided so I'm confident I've installed it correctly.
for a test, I've installed the package provided in arch community repository. It works absolutely fine out of the box. So how can I debug what's wrong inside the virtualenv?
