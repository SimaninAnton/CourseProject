Can I, using libmproxy, to load HTTP request from a text file, optionally same for the response and then process them as normal objects in mitmproxy world (modify headers/params, add cookies etc)?
I want to load a sitemap/requests from Burp to mitmproxy and then reply the whole conversation with additional stuff done by scripts. It's easy to dump stuff from Burp using a built-in export (output format is XML) or via custom few-lines of code plugin to dump everything directly to text files.
but I don't know how to parse those in mitmproxy
