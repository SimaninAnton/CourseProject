See https://discourse.mitmproxy.org/t/emulate-charles-proxys-map-local/116 for context - specifying .* as a replacement pattern currently replaces every single line in the message body. It feels more natural if that would replace the whole body altogether. We can accomplish this behaviour by passing re.DOTALL as a flag for FBod/FBodRequest/FBodResponse in mitmproxy/filt.py.
This issue should be pretty straightforward to implement, so I'll leave this for newcomers who are interested in contributing to mitmproxy. Feel free to ask here or on Slack if you have any further questions!
