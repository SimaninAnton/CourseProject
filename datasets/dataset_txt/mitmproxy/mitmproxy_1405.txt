I've just updated to mitmproxy 0.12.1 on Linux using KDE desktop environment (kubuntu 14.04). On previous versions of mitmproxy, I was able to use my mouse to select text and then copy/paste it into other programs. Now that mitmproxy responds to mouse clicks, I am not able to select text.
Most programs wait for a mouse press+release in the same spot before considering it a click. Mitmproxy just sees the press and doesnt wait for the release, so I cannot click my mouse and drag it to select text.
I see that there is a message "hold down alt or ctrl to select text" but this does not work in my terminal. Holding alt while clicking and dragging makes the whole terminal window drag around the desktop. Holding ctrl has no affect, and holding both of them does not help.
Is there an option to disable the mouse in mitmproxy and have it work like it did in previous versions?
