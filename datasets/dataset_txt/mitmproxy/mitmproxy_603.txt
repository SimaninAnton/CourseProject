I installed the p12 cert to a windows XP virtual machine, but unfortunately https sites are not working
this is very strange, as mitmproxy is installed in Trusted Root CAs, but browser complains about the issuer.
I wonder if it's related to windows XP only, or all versions of windows are affected.
under my linux box, everything is ok.
