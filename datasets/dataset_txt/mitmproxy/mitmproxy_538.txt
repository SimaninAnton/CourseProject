Hello,
I have a network of 2 devices, the network is configured to work as the following:
Device A Device B
| GATEWAY | --------> | MITMPROXY | ------> | SOURCE |
So basically only data coming from the gateway to the source flow through the device where mitmproxy is running, now if I configure this network to work as a normal network then I can intercept data in both directions with no issues, all I have to do is redirect flows on port 80 to port 8080 using IP tables.
The problem is if I change my configuration as shown above, I should still be able to intercept data coming from the gateway to source through mitmproxy right? I tried it but it does not see any flows even though the data is flowing properly, so if I check with tcpdump and wireshark and I can see flows going from gateway to source, but mitmproxy can't see anything, is this an issue with mitmproxy or am I doing something wrong?
