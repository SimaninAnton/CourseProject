Since upgrading to Firefox 31, browsing HTTPS websites fails with the following error message:
Secure Connection Failed
An error occurred during a connection to www.foobar.com.
Certificate contains unknown critical extension.
(Error code: sec_error_unknown_critical_extension)
Wondering whether this could be an issue with Mozilla's new PKI library that was released with FF 31 (https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/04/24/exciting-updates-to-certificate-verification-in-gecko/)?
