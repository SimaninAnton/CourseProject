First off, mitmproxy is such a wonderful tool; as a programmer turned pen-tester, I find it to be a lot more intuitive than using GUI-driven tools like Burp, and Zap.
The documentation states that mitmweb is still in beta, but I am unable to find any roadmap for it, or for mitmproxy in general. I'd like to contribute, and I see there are many issues to work on, but there doesn't appear to be any priorities set for any of them.
For now, I guess I'll take a look at the area/web tag.
Thanks,
