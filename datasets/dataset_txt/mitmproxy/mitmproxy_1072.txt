Hi,
Is there any plan for providing official support for windows ? I am aware that mitmdump works on windows. But i am more concerned about mitmproxy.
I have seen your comment regarding ncurses being the main reason for not able to provide windows support, have u tried PDcurses ?.
Also i have seen other issues in which it is mentioned that mitmweb will be able to provide windows support although that is not officially released till now. Any plans regarding mitmweb ?
It would be really great to have mitmproxy on windows, also i would like to include mitmproxy in PentestBox once windows support is complete.
Keep up the good work :)
