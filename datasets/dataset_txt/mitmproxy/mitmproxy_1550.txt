Hi there,
I was wondering - I'm running mitmproxy on a Linux machine with 2 NIC's (1 goes to clients and the other goes to the internet) - is there an option for "full transparency" - That is, that packets from the mitm to the internet will be sent with the client's src IP (and even MAC)?
If not - I'd be more than happy to hear tips on how to implement this.
(Also, out of curiosity - What would happen if the Internet NIC on the Linux machine is not given an IP? could the mitm-to-internet connection still work than?)
Thanks!
