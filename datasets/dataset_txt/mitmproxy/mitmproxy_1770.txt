several methods of installing the mitmproxy CA are listed on http://mitmproxy.org/doc/ssl.html
I would like to add one more:
keytool -importcert -alias mitmproxy -storepass "changeit" 
  -keystore /System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/Home/lib/security/cacerts
  -trustcacerts -file ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
this adds the cert to the cacert store for the OSX java environment.
and "changeit" really is the default password.
