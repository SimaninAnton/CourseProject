libmproxy.protocol doesn't exist in 0.10. However, git keeps the folder after a branch switch as the pyc files are on gitignore and thereby not removed. Now, I suspect that setuptools normally takes the .py files, but resort to the .pyc version if the .py one isn't available. As a result, the 0.10.1 release contains compiled pyc files for libmproxy.protocol. We had two bug reports lately which used an 0.11 example script which caused an import of libmproxy.protocol, e.g.
>>> import libmproxy.protocol
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/aldo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/libmproxy/protocol/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>    
ImportError: cannot import name AddressPriority
