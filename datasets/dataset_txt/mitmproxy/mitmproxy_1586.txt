Hi @mhils ,
I've continued my task and tried to integrate mitm in our testing environment.
The apache, haproxy and cas are in our VPN.
I've tried to use mitmproxy but the server gets disconnected, logging this message:
502: Server disconnect.
In the browser I can see a request with the following message:
net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
I've looked in the web for some answers and found those links:
#262 (issue in mitmproxy repository)
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mitmproxy/cLWjnJJ8FMA
We've watched the apache2 logs, in debug level, and it appears like there is no activity there.
When we turned off the mitmproxy it worked normally and we haven't received any errors.
However in my production environment it did work.
This behavior leads my to believe its might be in the code,
maybe in line 314 in:
https://github.com/mitmproxy/netlib/blob/master/netlib/http.py
I would really appreciate your help in this manner
Thanks,
Tal
