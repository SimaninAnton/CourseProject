Installing lxml is more or less painful on all the platforms we support. In particular, I tried for months to get the lxml maintainers to provide wheels for Windows, but to no avail.
We only use lxml for indenting the XML/HTML content views here. It would be interesting to see if we can just replace that with a more naive implementation that does indentation, so that we don't have to carry lxml with us.
As an additional benefit, doing this in Python instead of C should make the whole thing considerably safer.
