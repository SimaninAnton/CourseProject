If the original html/json response content is
Content-Encoding: gzip
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
encoded, and if it's modified by mitmproxy using addon scripts, then does the new response data client receives obey the same encoding settings (gzip+chunked)?
I can't configure the mitmproxy to run on Windows 10, so i just post the question here.
