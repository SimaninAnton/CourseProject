I have huge problems not being able to ignore domains or ips in transparent mode.
I have tried adding multiple --ignore 1.2.3.4:443--ignore domain.com and I still see in the logs
stuff like "client may not trust the proxy's certificate for graph.facebook.com."
I feel like the ignore acts totally differently in transparent mode and not acting as I expect it, is that true ? can I pass multiple --ignore in transparent mode?
how can I effectively and for real ignore multiple domain names in transparent mode?
