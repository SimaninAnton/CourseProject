Steps to reproduce the problem:
Followed these steps http://mitmproxy.org/doc/transparent/osx.html
mitmproxy -T --host
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Everything has worked smoothly up until this point. Traffic is not reaching its original intended target, so all my apps are acting as if they have no internet connection when I attempt to snoop their traffic.
sudo pfctl -s nat
No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
nat-anchor "com.apple/" all
rdr-anchor "com.apple/" all
rdr on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port = 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080
rdr on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port = 443 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080
