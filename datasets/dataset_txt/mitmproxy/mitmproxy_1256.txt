Hi, I am using mitmproxy now and I realized that when i run the command
mitmproxy --host -T -s pythonscript.py
the mitmproxy is running python3 instead of python2, it throws me an error message that there is a syntax error when I included the line [print "Downloading file"] in my python script. If I modify my script to be [print ("Downloading file")] it does not return any error messages.
May I know how can I fix my mitmproxy to run python2 instead of python3.
My ubuntu machine is running python2 by default.
