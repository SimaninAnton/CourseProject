class Modify: def response(self, flow): # parse the flow and redirct to another web if ....: redirect.... addons = [ Modify() ]
How can I redirect to another web after parse the response flow
I got the sample of "redirect_requests.py" , but it's redirct before response.
I need redirect after response, how can I do.
