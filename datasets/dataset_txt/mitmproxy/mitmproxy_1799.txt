I am new to all of these concepts, so I mgiht be doing something wring, but the mitmproxy just isn't working. I set it up using pip (although there was an unimaginable about of warnings that came up), and since then whenever I follow the tutorial of launching mitmproxy, then typing in i then ~q, nothing ever shows up in the screen. Anybody have any ideas? (Maybe the pip install doesn't work on mountain lion?)
