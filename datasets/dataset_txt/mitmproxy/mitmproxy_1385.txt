Hi!
I understand this is likely not the place to ask "How do I do X?" questions about mitmproxy, but I'm wondering if there's a specific place/community where to ask those kinds of questions
Googling around I've seen questions about mitmproxy in many different places, but there's not a place that looks like the "natural" place to send those questions.
Thanks a lot and sorry if it's a pretty obvious question - I believe that if there is such a place it should be more "advertised" on the project's home page
Thanks!
