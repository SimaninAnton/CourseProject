Mitmweb 4.0.3
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Intercept any HTTP POST packet
Download it
Try to edit it and upload it back
Nothing happens.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Even if I attach a debugger and set breakpoints to the FlowContent.post and FlowContent.get, only the second method works when I try to download the packet.
So, it looks like a problem in frontend JS code. And I believe it is because of the following error message when I upload something:
POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/flows/279d81d1-deee-4795-b99e-1c97e584f718/request/content?_xsrf=2|4a3759c3|09fcb860706632cb87ac58641d3472eb|1526013962 404 (Not Found)
