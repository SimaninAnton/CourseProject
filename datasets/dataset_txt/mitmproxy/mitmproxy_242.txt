Hey All,
I tried to connect my iPhone to mitmproxy and i didn't see any HTTPS traffic.
I configure the mitmproxy to be proxy server of my iPhone.
When i used transparent mode, i got the error: "Unexpected CONNECT request."
and when i tried to open the mitmproxy in regular mode then i didn't see traffic HTTPS traffic.
This is what i see:
10.129.0.50:53623: clientdisconnect
10.129.0.50:53624: clientconnect
10.129.0.50:53624: clientdisconnect
10.129.0.50:53626: clientconnect
