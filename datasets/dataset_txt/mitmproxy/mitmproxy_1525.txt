Currently, a user can specify the ciphers presented to the client by using the --ciphers switch. As with --ssl-version-client/--ssl-version-server, we should introduce --ciphers-server and rename --ciphers to --ciphers-client.
Relevant parts in the code:
libmproxy/proxy/config.py#L217
libmproxy/proxy/config.py#L58
libmproxy/proxy/server.py#L181-L218
