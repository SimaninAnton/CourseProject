Actully in this question i'm only asking how can i decrypt the SSL packet using TLS master secrets with mitmproxy in windows 10.
I uses the mitmproxy to capture traffic but it doesn't support .pcap format. Somewhere searching i see someone mention the this method
use log the TLS master secrets with mitmproxy
When i dig deep into the method log the TLS master secrets with mitmproxy i get nothing that can help me understand how to use this.
I'm asking in this form is there anyone who can help, if you tried can explain the procedure.
I'll use wireshark to capture and decrypt the SSL and save in pcap. if you know better procedure to save data in pcap your idea will be strongly appreciated.
Windows 10. or any version
