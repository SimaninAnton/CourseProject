Hello,
I search around but could not find the answer so I'd like to ask here.
I installed mitmproxy already, now I would like to develop a webapp (EX: VueJS + Python Flask) that users can view their request and response via mitmproxy server. I don't know how to read stored data via python flask.
Please help!
Sorry I am new here.
