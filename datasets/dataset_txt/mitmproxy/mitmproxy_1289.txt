When I connect my phone to Mitmproxy it seems I can't access streaming audio file (through MediaElement.js player) until disconnecting the proxy.
While the phone usually plays the audio (garbled and awful-sounding, unfortunately) it didn't start when connected to mitmproxy, and I saw 0 byte responses. Oddly enough I see the complete, normal file on reading the file back.
