I have this script:
from libmproxy.protocol.http import decoded
import pprint
import time

def response(context, flow):
    print('Path: ' + flow.request.path)
And im connected to the proxy with my android phone and using snapchat.
But some requests getting through...
Are the requests too big? They are 60-100kb.
