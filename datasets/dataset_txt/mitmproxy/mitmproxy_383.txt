The issue is :
I've download the MITMProxy zip(windows exe) file from official site and install it on my pc and install.
Afterward i tried to capture it works for HTTP but when i open any HTTPS site it show revoking certificate error.
I dig deep into this error still facing same issue i install the certificate but never worked, or may be my methodology to use MITMProxy is not right.
Anyone who work with MITMProxy windows can tell me the procedure and how to make MITMProxy works?
