Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmproxy -T
curl -x localhost:8080 example.com
What is the expected behavior?
mitmproxy should provide a warning that you want to run either transparent mode or configure an explicit proxy.
What went wrong?
mitmproxy complains about "Invalid HTTP request form (expected: relative, got: authority)"
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
We should just detect this very specific case (expected: relative, got: authority) and provide a better error message for it.
See #1579 for a confused user.
Mitmproxy Version: master
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
