Steps to reproduce the problem:
Follow all the mitm installations - try connecting to a https website when it's done. (it wont run)
Add the certificate from mitm.it and try connecting to a https website again, it will connect.
Port forward so you can you connect to the proxy on other IPs.
When trying to connect to a https website on another IP you will recieve "Your connection is not secure" even when the certificate is installed. You will be able to connect to http links though.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I've tried to get this to work for the past 2 days and no success. Is mitm not supposed to run on public net since i can only connect to http links.
