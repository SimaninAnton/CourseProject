Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install mitmproxy on a Ubuntu Virtual Machine running in virtualbox
Start TMUX and open a new window for mitmproxy
Run mitmproxy with default settings
Run top to monitor CPU usage, notice CPU usage for mitmproxy is around 20%. See captures from top here:
after-starting-mitmproxy.txt
before-starting-mitmproxy.txt
(note that the CPU usage of the top program is high in these captures since it ran in batch mode to capture savable output. Typically top drops to < 1% of CPU when run in interactive mode, but mitmproxy hovers around 20%)
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I took a look at #1112 and expected that the CPU usage would be under 1%.
