It's related to #1498
Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmproxy --http2
connect to https://h2o.examp1e.net by Firefox
Firefox show that connection failed
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I know that there are some website that suffer from receiving priority frame over idle/closed stream problem.
But I think that h2o.examp1e.net fixed that problem that I had test it by hyper-h2 client with code post at #1745.
I'm not very familiar about how mitmproxy transform client h2 frame to server,
so I still cannot reproduce by use hyper-h2 client.
