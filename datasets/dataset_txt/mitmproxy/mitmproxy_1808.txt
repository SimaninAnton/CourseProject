mitmproxy is one hell of a tool but I've come across some drawbacks. Looking at the code template and usage it seems that only one script can be active at a time. A nice addition would be to allow multiple scripts per mitmproxy process that would process responses in reverse order to request, ie, the first script would get request first but response last. This would enable multiple scripts per process to be chained.
Passing arguments to scripts would be usefull as well, perhaps a command line parameter. This would enable slightly tweaking the functionality since I'm finding myself copying scripts over and making slight modifications and then chaining proxies together at the moment.
I'd be happy to help out but would prefer some guidence of how you would like these features implemented. No used in submitting a patch that doesn't get accepted. Any suggestions?
