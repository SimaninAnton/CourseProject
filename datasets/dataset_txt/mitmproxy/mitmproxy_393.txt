Spring cleaning! We currently declare some dependencies which are either unused or can easily be substituted:
h11 - not used at all?
requests - tests + examples only.
We should IMHO also eventually consider removing the following dependencies, although that involves a bit of work and shouldn't be in scope for this issue:
pyasn1 - replace with asn1crypto, which is used by cryptography/pyOpenSSL
ldap3 - only used for ldap proxy auth, which should probably live outside of the core once we have a healthy addon system.
