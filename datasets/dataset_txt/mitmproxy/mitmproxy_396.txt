Currently, when an addon command's return type is not specified, we exit silently without a visible error. This is bad.
So this causes mitmproxy to exit silently:
    @command.command("mycommand.inc")
    def inc(self):
        pass
And this succeeds:
    @command.command("mycommand.inc")
    def inc(self) -> None:
        pass
