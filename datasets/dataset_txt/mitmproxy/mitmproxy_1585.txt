We are working on including mitmproxy into Fedora Package collection. But after the build process rpmlint complains about a couple of files.
mitmproxy.noarch: W: python-bytecode-without-source /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/protocol/tcp.pyc
mitmproxy.noarch: W: python-bytecode-without-source /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/protocol/__init__.pyc
mitmproxy.noarch: W: python-bytecode-without-source /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/protocol/primitives.pyc
mitmproxy.noarch: W: python-bytecode-without-source /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/protocol/http.pyc
Checking the tarball confirms that.
$ ls mitmproxy-0.10.1/libmproxy/protocol/
http.pyc  __init__.pyc  primitives.pyc  tcp.pyc
In git the right files are available. It would be nice if you fix this and release a new tarball (perhaps 0.10.2). Thanks in advance.
