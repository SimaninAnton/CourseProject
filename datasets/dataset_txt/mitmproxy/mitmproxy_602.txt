Hi, I use mitmproxy in upstream mode as a flow replayer by loading a couple scripts and resource files. It's never intended to deliver a request to remote server. Everything is ok except that, although each of the canned responses (loaded from a file on the disk) is correctly returned to the client, it actually makes connection to remote server on each of the flow via the upstream proxy server I configured in the cmd line, which is totally unnecessary and time-wasting in my senario.
Would it be possible to postpone the establishing of connection with server (after the request() hook has been revoked) so that my upstream mitmproxy server can run with a dummy -U flag, which don't have to be a real proxy server at all, as it never should really forward a request/establish a connection to remote server?
