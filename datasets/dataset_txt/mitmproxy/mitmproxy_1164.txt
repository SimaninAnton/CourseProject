import mitmproxy
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
ImportError: No module named mitmproxy
What is the expected behavior?
I would expect the module to be installed
What went wrong?
I installed mitmproxy with sudo pip install mitmproxy and it installed successfully. The binary mitmproxy runs fine but python can't find the module. Any ideas?
Thanks
Joao
