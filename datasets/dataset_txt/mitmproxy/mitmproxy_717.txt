Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmproxy -T --host
Capture something
Press f and filter by something like ~d domain.com or ~u domain com
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Going to detail view to get the resolved IP address and using it for the filter works, but it's uncomfortable when you want to match things like "google.com" (lots of IP ranges, lots of unrelated domains, but many mentioning google)
