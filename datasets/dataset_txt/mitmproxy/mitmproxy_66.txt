Steps to reproduce the problem:
Connect an iPhone to mitmproxy
Open an app like Messenger
Messenger can't connect to the internet.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I have tried using mitmproxy on Ubuntu and MacOS both, nothing has changed. The apps still can not access the internet. I can open websites normally (I've trusted the certificate) but not use apps like Messenger, Discord.
I'm on an iPhone 6s iOS 12.4, jailbroken. So, if there is a way to make this work that requires jailbreak, I would be happy to try it.
