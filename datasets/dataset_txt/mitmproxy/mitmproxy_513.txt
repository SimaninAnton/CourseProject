Trying to set up certificates, according to this post I should be able to go into the settings in chrome and import a certificate. I am trying to import the certificates that I generated by running mitmproxy for the first time. I converted the 1.pemfiles to.crt` format using the method recommended in the stackoverflow post here, which is referenced from the certificate manual installation guide here.
I cannot import the private keys into chrome due to an error message that pops up when I try to import that says "Incorrect private key":
Screenshot trying to import mitmproxy-ca-cert.crt
Screenshot trying to import mitmproxy.ca.crt
Screenshot trying to import mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12 (What is the correct password?)
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy after installing on Ubuntu 16.04
Try to import certificates manually into google chrome using the method recommended here
Still get " If you can see this, traffic is not passing through mitmproxy." on mitm.it
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Also tried installing using certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t C -n mitmproxy -i ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem, hasn't worked for me but maybe I need to restart?
