Hi,
I'm using mitmdump -T with inline script and parallel decorator. It's printing frequent error on console as "encoding error : input conversion failed due to input error, bytes 0x81 0x18 0x19 0xA0"
But the proxy works as normal with high cpu utilization(more than 100%) when processing requests.
Any idea what is it?
