The mitmweb interface does not seem to include protection against DNS rebinding. This could be exploited by a malicious website to either access the sniffed data or run arbitrary Python scripts on the filesystem by setting the scripts config option.
I have hacked together a PoC here (nothing really special to be seen though).
