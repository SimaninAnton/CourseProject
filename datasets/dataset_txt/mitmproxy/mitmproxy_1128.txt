Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install mitmproxy on Debian Jessie from git following the steps from here and here
Run mitmproxy -w somefile and connect a device to it as usual
Press oI and add .* to the list of ignore patterns
Hit qq and see connections from your device still appearing in the interface.
What is the expected behavior?
mitmproxy interface should behave as if there were no connections going through it, e.g. the interface should not display them and they should not be stored in the dump file.
What went wrong?
mitmproxy ignored --ignore patterns.
Any other comments?
$ mitmproxy --version
mitmproxy 0.18
I have built mitmproxy with the latest commit being this one.
