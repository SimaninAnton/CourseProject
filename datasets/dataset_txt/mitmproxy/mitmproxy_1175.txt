Basically like tail -f file, keep trying to read from the specified flow file periodically. This would allow you to do things like have mitmdump running on one machine outputting to a flow file, and mitmproxy reading that flow file on another machine. Especially useful when running mitmdump as a service on a Linux router in transparent mode, with iptables rules to control which hosts get sent through the proxy (which is my intended usecase).
