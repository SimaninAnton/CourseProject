Steps to reproduce the problem:
Try to select parts of the text in mitmproxy on a mac with a windows keyboard
Find out the selection override key is Fn
Key does not exist on keyboard but is on laptop keyboard
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
At the time I am kind of just reaching over to the mac itself to hit the fn key, with 10.12 I can't even use karabiner to do some rebind action as it is broken with the new version of osx. So it would be great if I can use a cmd option / config file to make mitmproxy to react to a different key for text selection
System information
mackbook pro mid 2014, osx 10.12.4
windows keyboard, with control and command swapped in OS if that changes anything.
