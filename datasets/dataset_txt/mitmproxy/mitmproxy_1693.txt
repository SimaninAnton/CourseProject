When I'm running
mitmproxy -F http://mycompany.proxy:8080
it correctly forwards http traffic to the specified upstream proxy but fails for https traffic. It seems the upstream proxy is ignored/skipped for https requests.
When running curl https://www.google.de I can see in the mitmproxy eventlog:
502: Error connecting to "www.google.de": [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
In my network I can't resolve external domain names but access them via the upstream proxy so the error indicates that the upstream proxy is not used for https requests.
I'm running version 0.10.1.
