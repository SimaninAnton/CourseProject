I'm currently working on a Synology SPK for mitmproxy which will allow users of Synology Devices an easy installation. more info on that toppic can be found here: SynoCommunity/spksrc#2554 Sadly i noticed that you've stopped uploading the source code to pypi with version 0.15. Since spksrc (the framework im using) skips wheel files because pip isn't able to distinguish between the different types of wheels (pure-python, manylinux etc) as a temp fix for debugging i linked to the github release but it would be nice to see the source in pypi again.
Thank you!
