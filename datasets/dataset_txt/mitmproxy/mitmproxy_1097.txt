Steps to reproduce the problem:
Connect iPhone to the MITMPROXY
Watch the MITMPROXY while iPhone is either on homescreen or in apps
There is a HUGE amount of logs about "iosapps.itunes.apple.com", and no ignore filters will ignore it. All the requests are GET requests.
After a while with the iPhone connected (10-15s of being on the homescreen), the MITMPROXY gets "killed", and shuts down.
What is the expected behavior?
Following the ignore filter, or atleast not shutting down because of the large amount of traffic.
What went wrong?
The proxy shuts down after an iPhone connects to it, since there is a huge amount of GET requests to iosapps.itunes.apple.com
Any other comments?
I actually don't care about the logs, I just don't want the proxy to close at all.
It doesn't matter if I use mitmdump or mitmproxy
