Hi,
Seems some of the examples are not updated to work the current libmproxy api (stickycookies in this case).
python stickycookies
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "stickycookies", line 44, in <module>
    m.run()
  File "stickycookies", line 20, in run
    return controller.Master.run(self)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/controller.py", line 112, in run
    self.tick(self.masterq)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/controller.py", line 102, in tick
    self.handle(*msg)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/controller.py", line 119, in handle
    m(obj)
  File "stickycookies", line 25, in handle_request
    hid = (msg.host, msg.port)
Working with most current build: commit 8eff2df
Thanks,
Josh
