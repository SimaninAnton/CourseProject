Steps to reproduce the problem:
I have installed certificate using this method on android (#2054 (comment))
So before week mitmproxy works fine, google had opened successfully in android chrome browser
but today i tried to open google it said your connection is not private
i also clear user credential, and update mitmproxy v4, reinstalled certificate
but still getting error that your connection is not private.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Removed Certificate, reinstalled using adb method
tried --ssl-insecure not work
