So I'm running mountain lion, and I have come across an error that I cannot figure out. It was just recently working fine, and then I quit out of it ans all of a sudden whenever I try to launch it I get this message.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/mitmproxy", line 19, in <module>
    from libmproxy import proxy, console, cmdline, version
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/libmproxy/proxy.py", line 19, in <module>
    from netlib import odict, tcp, http, wsgi, certutils, http_status
ImportError: No module named netlib
