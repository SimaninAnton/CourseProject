Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run pathod : pathod -a "/=200:p0,10"
Run mitmproxy.

pathoc -c localhost:9999 localhost:8080 'get:/'
Try to replay the corresponding live flow in mitmproxy by pressing r.

Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This issue is relevant for the situations, when server didn't have time to send a response yet, but a user tries to replay the corresponding flow.
I also faced this issue, when trying to replay mitm.it flow from onboardingapp.
