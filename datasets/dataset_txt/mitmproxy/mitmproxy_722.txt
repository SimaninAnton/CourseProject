Steps to reproduce the problem:
Create the following script1.py:
import mitmproxy.ctx

def response(flow):
    mitmproxy.ctx.log.info('this is an info')
    mitmproxy.ctx.log.warn('this is a warning')
    mitmproxy.ctx.log.error('this is an error')
Start mitmweb with this script: mitmweb -s script1.py
Enable Options → Display Event Log to show the event log pane.
Run a flow through mitmweb, for example: curl -vx http://localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/get/
Observe that three messages are printed to the system console (“this is an info”, “this is a warning”, “this is an error”), but only one of them is displayed in the event log pane in mitmweb (“this is an info”).
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Checking the “debug” checkbox at the top right-hand corner of the event log pane has no effect on this.
