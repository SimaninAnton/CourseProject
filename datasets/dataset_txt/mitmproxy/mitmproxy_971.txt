Steps to reproduce the problem:
Use har_dump.py as script
Browser lot of things
Eventually you will errors like this
Error: Script error: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/manish/Work/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/builtins/script.py", line 146, in run
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "har_dump.py", line 96, in response
    response_body_decoded_size = len(flow.response.content)
  File "/Users/manish/Work/mitmproxy/netlib/http/message.py", line 115, in get_content
    return encoding.decode(self.raw_content, ce)
  File "/Users/manish/Work/mitmproxy/netlib/encoding.py", line 56, in decode
    repr(encoding),
ValueError: AssertionError when decoding "\x87-\x00 with 'br'
What is the expected behavior?
Not throw error
What went wrong?
