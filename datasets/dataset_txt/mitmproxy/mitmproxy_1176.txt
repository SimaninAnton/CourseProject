Since both projects merged, and also the repository structure has changed significantly, it would be a good idea to merge the documentation as well. This means taking the pathod docs and add them as a part to the mitmproxy docs. Some parts might be redundant and can be removed. I think the interactive pathod/pathoc language preview feature can be replace entirely by a more extensive example section. Also the links in the README can be fixed after this.
The website pathod.net should then be a redirect to the mitmproxy documentation. (@cortesi)
