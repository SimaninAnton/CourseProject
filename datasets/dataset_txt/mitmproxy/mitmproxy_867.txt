Steps to reproduce the problem:
edit any inline script and add an error (example sslstrip-test.py attached with function nothing())
sslstrip-test.txt
mitmproxy --script sslstrip-test.py --eventlog
nothing in eventlog (see screenshot)
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Remember that it was working with v0.17.1, Maximilian said it was fixed from v0.18 to v0.18.2, so am i missing something here (a debug mode?)? Mitmproxy is still working, ignoring the script.
Thanks a lot,
