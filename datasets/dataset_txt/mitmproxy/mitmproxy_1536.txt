Hi,
I am trying to use mitmproxy with android emulator. But mitmproxy shows nothing. Here are the steps I followed:
Installed miltmproxy in laptop1
Enabled IP forwarding and port redirection in laptop 1 (redirected port 80 and 443 to 8080)
Installed miltmproxy CA certificate in the Android emulator running in laptop 2
Set laptop 1 as proxy in Android emulator (just enter the ip address of laptop 1, did not enter any port)
Then I tried to run mitmproxy and mitmproxy -T --host. But nothing works.
Anyone can tell me what's wrong?
Thanks
