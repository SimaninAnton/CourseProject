I receive errors from dumper on standard output, they would be better to appear on StandardError
Ex:
"Error in WebSocket connection to 192.x.x.x:443: WebSocket connection closed unexpectedly by server: TcpDisconnect(None,)"
Think it comes from here:
mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addons/dumper.py
Line 245 in 3cd3765
 def websocket_error(self, f): 
There's the same output for tcp_error apparently:
mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addons/dumper.py
Line 270 in 3cd3765
 def tcp_error(self, f): 
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
