Hello, I've got this problem when I try to import basethread module :
1.Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/.../mitm-proxy-server.py", line 14, in
from mitmproxy import controller, proxy, flow
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/controller.py", line 12, in
from netlib import basethread
ImportError: cannot import name basethread
I don't know why this problem occured, but I need to fix it if I want to use mitmproxy like I need
