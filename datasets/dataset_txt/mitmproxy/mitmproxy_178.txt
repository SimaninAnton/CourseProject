Hello, I have a problem, that when I establish connection mitmproxy can't proceed to the next layer because of the call of the peek function during final stage of establishing connection with client. What is this call for? How can I figure out what the reason for this problem is. I deleted this peek (1) and then the program again is hanging when making peek(3) in _next_layer() function.
