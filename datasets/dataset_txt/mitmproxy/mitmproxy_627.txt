Is it possible and how to approach creating a portable version of mitmproxy? I'd simply like to deploy it like e..g go binaries, without any additional dependencies and so on. Everything in a single package, dumped on a server and ready to go.
docker is good, but it requires installing docker itself
I once tried pex to bundle everything, but it did not actually work - maybe I need to check it again if there is no other better alternative
any other way to pack everything or build everything to a standalone package? How in general python packages should be deployed this way? without any dependencies and so on.
