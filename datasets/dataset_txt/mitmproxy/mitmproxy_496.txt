Steps to reproduce the problem:
Open mitmproxy
Press - to open two pane layout.
Click on the header of the "Events" tabs.
The "Events" tab does not get focus.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This is particularly annoying on Windows, where "shift tab" to switch tabs does not register under WSL. The only way to switch tabs under Windows right now is to open a command prompt and enter console.panes.next.
