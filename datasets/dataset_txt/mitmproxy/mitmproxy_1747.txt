Hi there,
I was wondering if mitmproxy allows rewriting of server response when running in transparent mode.
I have an inline script to modify the code and it works when running like this:
./mitmproxy -s rewrite.py
however in transparent mode it has no effect. I run it as following:
./mitmproxy -T -s rewrite.py
Thanks,
Masi
