Anyone interested on being able to read flows from stdin?
I've tried the usual convention of using a single dash for the filename, but it didn't work. I'd expect mitmproxy -r /tmp/flows to be equivalent to cat /tmp/flows | mitmproxy -r -, but the latter blows up like this:
$ cat /tmp/flows | mitmproxy -r -
# ...
  File "/home/thiago/devel/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urwid/raw_display.py", line 635, in _getch_nodelay
    return self._getch(0)
  File "/home/thiago/devel/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urwid/raw_display.py", line 545, in _getch
    return ord(os.read(self._term_input_file.fileno(), 1))
TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 0 found

mitmproxy has crashed!

Shutting down...
I'm willing to try a PR if there's interest in this (and no obvious restriction, of course).
