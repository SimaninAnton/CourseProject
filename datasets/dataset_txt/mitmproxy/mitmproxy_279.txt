I've been working on a nicer interface for the snapshot server to streamline our release process: https://www-test.mitmproxy.org/downloads/.
There are five user-facing parts that may be affected by this:
The mitmproxy.org landing page, which has a big red download button (or brew install instructions for OSX) and a link to "Other Downloads".
The top menu on mitmproxy.org.
The downloads listing at https://www-test.mitmproxy.org/downloads/.
The installation docs at https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/.
The GitHub releases page at https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases.
Now, how do we structure this best? Some thoughts:
The big red OS-specific button on mitmproxy.org should stay as-is IMHO. The "Other Downloads" link currently points to the installation docs. I thought about pointing it to /downloads, but that page in its currently form is missing pointers to Docker, WSL, and pip.
The same goes for potentially adding "Downloads" to the top menu. I am currently slightly on this as people would go there quickly and miss rather important info on Docker, WSL, and pip.
Currently this is just a directory listing with a pointer to the docs. Can we/do we want to do better here and also include pointers to Docker, WSL, pip, ...? That would at least solve the problems with 1 and 2, but now this page would kind of be competing with the docs.
If we add the important stuff to mitmproxy.org/downloads, do we even want more elaborate docs on this? I am not sure - I'd also be fine with deemphasizing the /downloads page a bit by only linking to it from here.
Finally an easy one: We should just redirect to the docs or /downloads here.
@mitmproxy/devs, thoughts? Please keep in mind that we don't want to make this complicated, getting mitmproxy should be straightforward and we should only point to alternative ways for users that are interested.
