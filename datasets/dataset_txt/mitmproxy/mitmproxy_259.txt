Can you explain please how to run a new version of mitmproxy on Debian 9? When I run
"mitmproxy" I always get the error, that python 3.6 or higher must be installed, despite the fact that I've installed it.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Aliases for "python" and "python3" pointing to python3.6
update-alternatives switching to python3.6
3."python --version" says "Python 3.6.4"
Installing python 3.6 from sources and from testing repository
Installing mitmproxy from git
Installing mitmproxy via pip
System information
Debian-9-x86_64
Mitmproxy 4.0.3
