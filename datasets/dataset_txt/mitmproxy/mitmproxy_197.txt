Hi,
I am trying to reveal the API used of the app here : https://apkpure.com/danfoss-link%E2%84%A2/com.danfoss.linkapp
I thought this app would use SSL Pinning but i can't find any references to this in the code but what i can see is that it links to some technology where they state this :
Secure Device Grid provides a 256-bit elliptic curve encrypted communication protocol securing your communication between the device and smartphone.
and
With Secure Device Grid you benefit from an automated mechanism to create an Internet Protocol (IP) connection through firewalls and routers. This enables the device to be accessible and communicate with any paired device without compromising the security. Secure Device Grid provides a 256-bit elliptic curve encrypted communication protocol securing your communication between the device and smartphone.
When i use mitmproxy i see nothing from the app, is it because it's not HTTP traffic ?
