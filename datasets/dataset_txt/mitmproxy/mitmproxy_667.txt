I was trying to intercept the flow between a client and server using HTTP protocol. Everything was good before client set up another SSL-socket without HTTP header to the server.
Mitmproxy hints: "HTTP protocol error in client request: Bad HTTP request"
Client sent JSON-like data could be decoded by mitmdump like:" { "request":"John" , "name":"foo" }".
Then mitmproxy closed the connection.
So, is there any way to get an option to disable HTTP protocol parser and just forward these socket packets?
