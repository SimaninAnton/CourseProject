A super easy task for someone who wants to get started working on mitmproxy: There are quite a few occasions in the codebase where we still use old-style variable type annotations, e.g. here:
mitmproxy/mitmproxy/websocket.py
Line 66 in 660aa87
 self.messages = []  # type: List[WebSocketMessage] 
In Python 3.6 this can be expressed much more nicely without the use of a comment:
self.messages: List[WebSocketMessage] = []
(see https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep526)
A great beginner task to get familar with the whole development process would be to go through the codebase and replace all occurences of # type: with the proper new annotation form. That should be pretty straightforward to do, so this issue is strictly meant for first time contributors only.
