Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy on a Raspberry Pi (ARM)
Connect an iPhone with Snapchat installed to that running mitmproxy
Start Snapchat
mitmproxy segfaults
What is the expected behavior?
No seg fault.
Any other comments?
Does not happen when mitmproxy runs on OS X.
Mitmproxy Version: 0.10.1
Operating System: Raspibian 8.0, Linux 4.1.18-v7+
