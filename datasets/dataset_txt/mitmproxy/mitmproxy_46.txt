Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
When starting the proxy on a machine that has IPv4 disabled, the proxy fails to start. Taking a look at the code, it seems that issue occurs when the socket option IPV6_V6ONLY is set to 0 and the system does not allow IPv4-enabled sockets.
Describe the solution you'd like
Adding an ipv6_only option was pretty quick & easy, and I have a potential patch, but I wanted to see if this is a reasonable thing to do?
Describe alternatives you've considered
It could also make sense to--instead of adding an ipv6_only option--add an option that gives the user full control to select ipv6_only, ipv4_only, or both ipv4 + ipv6, where the proxy does not attempt to fall back on another protocol.
