Updated my Arch box. I now get this in mitmproxy:
sudo mitmproxy
Traceback (most recent call last):

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'netlib<0.14,>=0.13' distribution was not found and is required by mitmproxy
I've downgraded python2-netlib down to python2-netlib-0.13.1-1-any. Mitmproxy is working again.
Folks in #archlinux recommended I file an upstream bug and then an Arch bug with a link to the upstream bug. This is the first step of that process.
