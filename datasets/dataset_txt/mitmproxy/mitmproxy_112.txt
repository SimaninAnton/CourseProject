Sorry if this question is a bit blurry, I'm trying to adapt an old wrapper for mitmproxy to the current version. I haven't touched the code in a long time and I pretty much have no idea what I'm doing.
In previous versions of mitmproxy I was able to use it as a library by creating a class InjectingMaster(flow.FlowMaster) and calling flow.FlowMaster.__init__(self, server, state), defining handle_request and such...
How can I do it in the current version?
