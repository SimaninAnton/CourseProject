Steps to reproduce the problem:
Download precompiled version of mitmdump from https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases as per installation instructions for linux
pip3 install ipwhois
verify that install worked by running python3 then running from ipwhois import IPWhois (import works here)
Run mitmproxy with a script as follows ~/mitmdump -s test_includes.py with the following in test_script.py
from ipwhois import IPWhois
getting the following error:
Script error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "../mitm_script.py", line 6, in <module> from ipwhois import IPWhois ImportError: No module named 'ipwhois'
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
After installing ipwhois or any library to import into my script, the module cannot be found in the included script
