Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install mitmproxy, gevent, gevent_openssl
Monkey patch for gevent_openssl and then gevent
Go to a HTTPS website
<< Cannot establish TLS with www.google.com:443 (sni: www.google.com): TlsException("SSL handshake error: Error([('SSL routines', 'SSL_do_handshake', 'connection type not set')])")
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
HTTP works just fine, but HTTPS sites seem to be broken when doing this method.
