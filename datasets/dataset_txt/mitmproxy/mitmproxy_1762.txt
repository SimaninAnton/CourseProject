In case of using a mitmproxy as a transparent proxy and the client does not use SNI, the mitmproxy does not know for which hostnames the certificate needs to be created. Therefore it would be nice if mitmproxy can get hints about hostname/ip-mapping when started, e.g. by reading a hosts file. Also it would be nice if it is possible to inform mitmproxy about new hostnames on the fly when it is running and if mitmproxy could scan returned HTML pages for new hostnames to add them to the mapping.
