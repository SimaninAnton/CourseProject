Hi all,
I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for help. I'm new to mitmproxy and I'd like to explore mitmproxy as an option for splitting HTTP GET requests at the proxy level.
The idea is similar to that of "download accelerators", where the proxy takes one HTTP GET request (for a chunk of data) from the application/browser and split the request to multiple GET requests for "sub-chunks" of the file. Upon receiving the sub-chunks, the proxy then re-orders and combines them into one chunk and pass it on to the application.
Is it possible for mitmproxy to do that? Does anyone has an existing script/library that can achieve this purpose?
If anyone can point me in the right direction, that would be much appreciated.
Thank you.
Regards,
Jonathan
