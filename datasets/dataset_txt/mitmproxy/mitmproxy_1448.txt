I installed MITMProxy from Homebrew on OS X Mavericks ("brew install mitmproxy"). It works normally most of the time, but it has crashed twice when I have held down the 'd' key for a few seconds to delete some entries in the list. I don't have any clear-cut steps to reproduce because it doesn't happen most of the time.
Here is the stack trace:
