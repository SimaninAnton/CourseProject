Steps to reproduce the problem:
Install mitmproxy from source (I can't do it on pip)
Realize that netlib is only a link for the mitmproxy pip package... (See https://pypi.org/project/netlib/)
Not be able to install netlib.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I have tried to also install the pip package, but nothing happened.
