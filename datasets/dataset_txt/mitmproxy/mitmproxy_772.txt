Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmproxy -b ::1
Error starting proxy server: gaierror(-9, 'Address family for hostname not supported')
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The relevant code is probably hardcoded to IPv4
mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/tcp.py
Line 921 in 2316c0f
 self.socket = socket.socket(self.address.family, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
