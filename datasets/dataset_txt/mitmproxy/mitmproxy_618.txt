I've found that if i want to build a custom http ALG(app-layer-gateway), which can:
1、act like a reverse proxy,
2、can modify the Host、Referer header field of client request、and Location of server 302 redirect
3、can modify the content of JSON response, to prefix all the http://... url with http://< my-mitmproxy-ip-port >/http://...
4、log all the original client request data and server response data
The doc doesn't say how to do this. It seems mitmproxy/mitmdump is expected to be used as a cmd tool, not a lib.
Can anyone show me how to do this? I need a simple python script as a main driver...
