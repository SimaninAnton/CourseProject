Hi, i'm having problems connecting the Android emulator to mitmproxy with the -http-proxy option. I installed the certificate as usual but when i try to connect the android emulator browser to an HTTPS site I keep getting the same error on event log in master version:
"SSL handshake error: The client may not trust the proxy's certificate.". And in the mitmproxy ubuntu repository version I get:
"SSL handshake error: (-1, 'Unexpected EOF').".
I've the same problem on an Ubuntu 12.04, Lubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 14.04. The first 2 are being run inside a VM. I also tried changing the host OS /etc/environment to use mitmproxy as proxy but I keep having the same problem. I tested intercepting the traffic Burp and worked.
Thanks,
Joaquin
