pHad problems installing mitmproxy on my OSX Yosemite with python 2.7 using easy_install and got this error
Running cryptography-0.9.3/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-rauMRA/cryptography-0.9.3/egg-dist-tmp-zlKfoq
error: Not a directory
installing using pip gives me
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip-build-qjWm6R/cffi
What does that mean?
