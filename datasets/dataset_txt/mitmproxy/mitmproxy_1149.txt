Steps to reproduce the problem:
Catch some requests that have JSON responses
Try to limit your display to responses that contain an empty list
What is the expected behavior?
Something like ~bs '"key"':[] should result in matching all bodies that contain "key":[]
What went wrong?
No match
Any other comments?
I've tried several different variations of quoting and escaping the [] to no avail. My ultimate goal is to match bodies that contain the key, but whose value is not an empty list, and my responses are all minified JSON. (So my expression would be something like ~bs '"key"' & ! ~bs '"key":[]' which I've tried, and it tells me Invalid filter expression.)
