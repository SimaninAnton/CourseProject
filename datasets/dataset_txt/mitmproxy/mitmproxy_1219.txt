Steps to reproduce the problem:
install mitmproxy
turn off wifi on sprint device
make an http request
What is the expected behavior?
proxy should authenticate
What went wrong?
proxy won't authenticate over LTE on sprint iphones
Any other comments?
I have mitmproxy set up and working, but I'm experiencing strange issues. Each device has a VPN profile we install containing the certificate. On Att and Verizon phones there are no issues, but on Sprint phones the authentication only works over wifi. When wifi is turned off and the request goes over LTE the proxy doesn't authenticate.
mitmproxy version: 0.13
Operating System: ubuntu 14.04
