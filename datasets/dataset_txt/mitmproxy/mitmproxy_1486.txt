I was trying to fiddle with the onboarding app settings because I couldn't get the default mitm.it to work (while I easily could previously). To try it out on my pc I invoked it as such:
mitmproxy --app-port 8080 --app-host localhost
After pointing my browser to http://localhost:8080/ I got the following HTTP 400 error.
HttpError('Invalid HTTP request form (expected: absolute, got: relative)',)
Not really sure whether this was indeed mitmproxy so I checked the header and indeed it was. It also says I'm running version 0.11: Server:mitmproxy 0.11.
Any idea why this may have occurred?
Slightly related there is another small issue. After restarting the app on port 80 (and confirming it was offline beforehand) it refused to restart on port 80 but in fact was alive on 8080 again. Maybe it somehow incorrectly remembers on which port it used to be?
