 loop.add_signal_handler(getattr(signal, signame), master.shutdown) 

According to the asyncio documentation for Python 3.6 , add_signal_handler is supported for UNIX system only. I haven't experienced or tested this issue but it maybe a potential risk since mitmproxy supports multiple platforms.
If someone has a Windows OS and/or some knowledge about asyncio maybe you could verify this.
