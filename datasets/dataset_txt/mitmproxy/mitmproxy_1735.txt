I redirect en0 (my wireshark is using this interface to sniff) to localhost 8080, then connect my android device to my macbook via Wifi sharing. (settings are following instruction: http://mitmproxy.org/doc/transparent/osx.html). But the device's http request just being jammed and there is nothing showing on mitmproxy.
During the setup, there is a warning message:
No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
I'm not sure if I did it wrong or the instruction is out-dated.
OSX version: 10.9.1
Thank you
