Hello,
I would like to record full http + websocket traffic including websocket messages.
I have tried mitmdump -w dump
However, it seems that in the recorded file, only the http requests+ responses are recorded, and the websocket initialisation, but not the separate websocket messages (called frames in chrome Dev tool).
Is it possible to record the websocket frames too with the command line directly ?
I am running master (46901d1)
Thanks in advance
