I'm using mitmdump as reverse proxy with script. How can I get original (or incoming) request host.
For example: http://mysite.com/something => https://example.com/something
Now flow.request.host == example.com, flow.request.url == https://example.com/something
I need to get mysite.com and http://mysite.com/something as well.
