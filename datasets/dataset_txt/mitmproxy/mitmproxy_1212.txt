Hello!
First of all - great software! Just what I need - not being a networking expert leaves me with a number of issues though. It seems that this issues section is used a forum - so I ask here. If there is some IRC channel or Google group I missed - please let me know.
Okay, so I capture traffic - works smoothly. Now I want to store the captured requests so I can analyze them tomorrow. Am I correct that the proper workflow is:
[w]
specify file path "~/mitmproxy_traffic"
tomorrow: mitmproxy -r ~/mitmproxy_traffic
This seems to work - but there are at least three aspects about it that make me wonder if this is the optimal way to do it:
I cannot choose a file format (XML, CSV, ...) - would like to
it seems that I cannot store the unencrypted traffic (which I see in the console) - would like to
if I open the file with mitmproxy -r then mitmproxy is in active mode and new (completely unrelated) traffic is added to the loaded traffic - would not like that
Essentially my question is - is it possible to solve the issues described in a,b and c or are those indicators at missing features?
Kind Regards
Raffael
