Steps to reproduce the problem:
build image from Dockerfile
run mitmproxy/base:latest-onbuild image
docker attach to the docker container
What is the expected behavior?
can ssh to the running container.
What went wrong?
with docker ps -a, the running container exited and can not connect it.
Any other comments?
Mitmproxy Version: lastest master branch
Operating System: mac_osx 10.11.1
