Steps to reproduce the problem:
openssl genrsa -out cert.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key cert.key -out cert.crt
cat cert.key cert.crt > cert.pem
then i run mitmproxy in transparrent mode and i add --cert *=cert.pem
sudo nano cert.pem
create txt file in ansi on my pc and copy paste the cert.pem. then save file
send cert.pem to my android phone and instlal certificate.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
certificates installs successfully on the phone. then i get handshake error on the mitmproxy and cant visit any https website on the phone. Phone connects to linux server using pptpd. non https sites works. https i get error.. If i run in regular mode and add manually proxy then i can visit mitm.mi and download cert,install it and it works fantastic.however when i run mitmproxy in transparrent mode i cannot visit mitm.it on the phone as it says that traffic does not go through mitmproxy but it DOES go because non https websites i can visit them..
Is it wrong the way i try to create my own certificate in order to avoid downloading a new one all the time(plus mitm.it isnt working when on transparrent)??
thank you
