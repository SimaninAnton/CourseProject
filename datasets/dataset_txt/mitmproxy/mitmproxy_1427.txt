The HTTPResponse class seems tightly controlled. It could use some more flexible constructors and it should be able to handle a wide variety of inputs. It requires an odict.ODictCaseless for the headers param in the constructor. The code implies that it will accept None but in fact this causes a crash. It also prevents __repr__ from functioning.
I'd be happy to add some convenience functions. Being able easily to supply a wholly manufactured response in reply to certain requests is very valuable, but the documentation is very unhelpful. Documentation and better HTTPResponse generation would be a good step.
