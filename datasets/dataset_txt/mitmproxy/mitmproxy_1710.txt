Hi,
In my attempt to cause the client connection to use TLS version < 1.2 (in order to successfully exploit the new iOS SSL vulnerability), I tried changing the method flag in self.client_conn.convert_to_ssl in server.py to be TLSv1_METHOD but it failed to work - the SSL handshake with the client does not occur at all when I put this flag. (The mitm server recieves a "client hello" from the client, opens a connection to the remote server and does not answer the client at all (no "server hello" or any other message is sent)
I did not see any mentioning of enforcing TLS < 1.2 for client connections in the latest commit - it is needed in order to exploit the new iOS SSL vulnerability (it is required to do so in order to exploit it successfully) - so perhaps I'm missing something out.
The clients I tasted this with were iOS clients with iOS < 7.0.6.
