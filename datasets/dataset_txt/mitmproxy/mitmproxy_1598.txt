After few minutes of running MITMProxy, I can't browse anymore.
MITMProxy is still running but it looks like it is hang up.
I looked in the event log and found this error.
ProxyError(NetLibError('Error connecting to "SERVER_IP_HERE": [Errno 24] Too many open files',),)
What is the possible cause of this issue? Any workaround for this?
MITMProxy version 0.11
