mitmproxy's CA certificate (taken from ~/.mitmproxy or mitm.it) installed on a machine means that any mitmproxy user could take advantage of it.
shouldn't it be generated at mitmproxy installation/first-use? as explained on https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/#using-a-custom-certificate-authority
