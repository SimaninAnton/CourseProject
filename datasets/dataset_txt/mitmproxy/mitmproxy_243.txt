Hi, thanks for your great work with mitmproxy!
I beleive I found a bug.
Example:
Let's say I want to show only requests containing a digit in url.
Filter \d does the trick. However, I cannot enter it interactively via f hotkey. Setting it via --view-filter "\d" works fine.
System info
I'm running an image from dockerhub
# mitmproxy --version
