Hello,
I am a little bit confused with catching tcp traffic with mitmproxy.
I do like this:
mitmdump(mitmproxy) --raw-tcp -p 5656
on my VM I do: netcat 192.168.50.10 5656
my machines are connected through bridge, so I can ping all VM's from host and in opposite direction as well.
so, I want to simply record this tcp traffic , but every time I type something I get an error ( this does not happen if I type on host instead mitmdump --raw-tcp -p 5656 (or mitmproxy):
192.168.20.1:45020: clientconnect
192.168.20.1:45020: ProtocolException("Error in HTTP connection: HttpSyntaxException('Bad HTTP request line: 1',)",)
192.168.20.1:45020: clientdisconnect
Why I get a message about http? What I should do to parse , intercept and analyze raw tcp packets? And maybe some others , which have no relation to http at all and are unencrypted?
