Please note it is possible another program is the problem and infected mitmweb.exe. I thought however that the risk was sufficiently serious that it was worth reporting and having several people double check.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Installed mitmweb using the windows installer
Two weeks later, after a full scan, Norton reported Trojan.Gen.6 infection of mitmweb.exe and removed the exe.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I have just uninstalled
System information
Uninstalled, though installation / version was about 10/06/2018 (I then went away and noticed infection on return, after full scan by Norton).
