wrapping in proxychains works however DNS is still done locally instead of the proxychained, mitmproxy.
so would love to have the following happen:
HTTP request for www.example.com -> mitmproxy forwards request to upstream HTTP proxy -> HTTP Proxy performs DNS and request, response sent to mitmproxy -> mitmproxy adds a few bytes-> modified response provided
