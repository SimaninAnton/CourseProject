I'm getting odd behavior trying to proxy my feed reader (liferea) for debugging. I have some HTTP Basic Auth RSS feeds from Livejournal which look like http://users.livejournal.com/davis-square/data/rss?auth=digest. Wireshark shows an unauthenticated request followed by a 401 response, then liferea re-requesting with Basic Auth and a 200 response. If I instead use mitmproxy, mitmproxy only shows a single request/response:
‚Üê 502: Error connecting to "bob@users.livejournal.com":
[Errno -5] No address associated with hostname
(Edit: Non-substantive change to make examples consistent with each other.)
