I have download certificate in browser and trust the proxy’s certificate in my android phone.But many apps still cannot connect the internet while others can,and the log of mitmproxy show “the client do not trust the proxy’s certificate for...”. It seems that many apps check the certificate and find the certificate is sended by a middleman.So my question is how to let these apps to trust the proxy’s certificate.
