Problem Description
Hello. I am trying to filter the flows in a case insensitive manner. The documentation (https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-filters/) says that the accepted regex is just like Python:
Regexes are Python-style
It doesn't seem to be the case.
If I try to enter the filter ~bq (?i)user, I get the error Invalid interception filter: ~bq (?i)user.
The expected result was that I would see any flows that contain the word user in the request in a case insensitive way.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Make a couple of requests to add a few flows to mitmproxy
Press f and type the filter ~bq (?i)user
Notice the error message
