Steps to reproduce the problem:
install mitmproxy through brew and then configure iPhone as per guide on http://jasdev.me/intercepting-ios-traffic. Try to install CA on iPhone 6S but can't connect to mitm.it (connection time out error) properly. Then install CA on Macbook (setting the proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080) and it works. Need some suggestion. Thanks.
