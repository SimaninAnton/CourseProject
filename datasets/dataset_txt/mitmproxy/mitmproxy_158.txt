Steps to reproduce the problem:
Launch mitmweb with mitmweb --set block_global=false --web-iface 0.0.0.0.
Navigate to port 8081 on the mitmweb IP address.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I see square instead of what I assume are fontawesome icons.
I think this might be similar to #3397 - and maybe even #3034 - however, will let developers decide.
