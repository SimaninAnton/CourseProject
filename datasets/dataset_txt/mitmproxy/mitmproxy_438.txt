Hello,
Installing mitmproxy 0.18.2, as WIFI-PUMPKIN dependency. Kali 2017.3 on Raspberry Pi3.
Though, everything installs just fine, I get the following error, when starting mitmproxy:
"from backports import ssl_match_hostname
ImportError: cannot import name ssl_match_hostname"
Tried reinstalling blackports.ssl_match_hostname many times over, followed by pip install -U mitmproxy==0.18.2
But, always ends up with this error.
