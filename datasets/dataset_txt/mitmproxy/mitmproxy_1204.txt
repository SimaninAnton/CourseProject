In a nutshell,
get:'http://127.0.0.1:52428/p/200:d0:h"Date"="Sun, 03 Mar 2013 04:00:00 GMT"'
is converted to
get:"http://127.0.0.1:52428/p/200:d0:h"Date"="Sun, 03 Mar 2013 04:00:00 GMT""
which doesn't work for obvious reasons.
Code:
>>> spec = 'get:\'http://127.0.0.1:52428/p/200:d0:h"Date"="Sun, 03 Mar 2013 04:00:00 GMT"\''
>>> language.parse_request(settings, spec)
get:"http://127.0.0.1:52428/p/200:d0:h"Date"="Sun, 03 Mar 2013 04:00:00 GMT""
