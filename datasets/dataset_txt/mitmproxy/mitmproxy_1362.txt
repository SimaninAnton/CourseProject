just upgraded from v0.9.2 to v0.13
sudo pip install mitmproxy --upgrade
and now mitmproxy doesn't start, I'm getting the following message:
# vagrant at dev in ~ [12:34:26]
$ mitmproxy
: cannot connect to X server

# vagrant at dev in ~ [12:34:29]

mitmproxy version: 0.13
operating system: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
