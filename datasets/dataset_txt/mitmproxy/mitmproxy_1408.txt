I went to mitm.it and downloaded and added the CA for it on chrome.
when I go to https://github.com, the padlock is green but the website is blank.
I am getting back 403.
Upon inspection, it's having some trouble with Proxy-Authenticate.
I already provide a setHeader argument for Proxy Authroization.
please help.
