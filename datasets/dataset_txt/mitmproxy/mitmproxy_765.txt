Steps to reproduce the problem:
try to run mitmdump.exe or mimtproxy.exe on windows (tried on Windows 7 64 bits)
an error dialog appears complaining about the lack of the vcruntime140.dll file.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I managed to make it work by installing the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, x86 version, from here:
