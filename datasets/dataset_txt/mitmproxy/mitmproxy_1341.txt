Hi,
Am looking to see the certificate of the client. That way I can identify device x from device y while looking at the traffic. Inside the flow object there is a client connection which contains clientcert variable. But this variable is None.
flow.client_conn.clientcert --- gives none?
Any ideas on why? Am I missing a concept here?
