Steps to reproduce the problem:
After setting or removing the view_filter in flows list, the number of flows in the status bar is not updated.
open mitmproxy
open some url (populate flow list)
Without navigating through the list, set a view filter e.g. :set view_filter=google
The flow list is filtered but the status bar is not updated.
On navigating through the focus, the status is updated.
Try removing the view_filter. Same thing happens.
