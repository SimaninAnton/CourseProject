I'm using arpspoof and mitmproxy on debian testing. When I try to access some sites.(like: eurosport.pl) (on proxied computer) browser tells Service Unavailable. When I disable arpspoof and put mitmproxy ip and port in browser configuration - it works well - no errors.
Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong? Or maybe it is a bug in mitmproxy?
Best regards,
