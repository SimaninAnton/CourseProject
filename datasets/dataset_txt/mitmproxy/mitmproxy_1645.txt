I see that #88 added the ability to stream large files instead of downloading them upfront and then parsing them, but - and correct me if I'm wrong - it seems like there is no way to modify such files with mitmproxy.
Does something exist outside mitmproxy that allows one to modify these files?
Would you guys be interested in a feature that allows you to modify data as it streams?
I think this use case is particularly interesting when the user it downloading a large executable file, a song, a movie, or even a compressed file with any of those.
For an example of what I'm talking about, I have a proof of concept in c that injects code into a file in a streaming way: https://github.com/vikstrous/binder_full_of_elves/blob/master/stream_bind.c (linux x86-64 LE only for now)
I'm particularly excited about injecting into streaming video :)
I understand that mitmproxy was not designed for this, but I think it would be a great feature and I'm interested in contributing to make this happen.
