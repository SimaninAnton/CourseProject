Hello,
While i was playing with a custom script, i tried to dumps the flow.get_state() in order to send it to a rest API. Unfortunately some bytes values are present and i got the following:
variable = json.dumps(flow.get_state())
...
TypeError: Object of type 'bytes' is not JSON serializable
Am i missing something ? Do i need to use pickle instead ?
Thanks in advance,
