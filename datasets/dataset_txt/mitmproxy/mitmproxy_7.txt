Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Actually, the problem is that I can't load any HTTPS site because my ISP blocks the CONNECT tunnel, and it is a problem for any proxy server that I use (not only mitmproxy). The connection gets reset by peer on requesting any HTTPS site.
I was wondering if there's a workaround for this, or the CONNECT tunnel is always necessary to be used?
