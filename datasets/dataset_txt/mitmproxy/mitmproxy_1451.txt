Hi,
I run mitmdump as an HTTP proxy. After sometime all my requests fail with the following error :
ProxyError(NetLibError('Error connecting to "www.cnn.com": [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname',),)
Is this a known issue? I haven't tried to debug DNS requests in detail yet...Restarting mitmdump solves the problem immediately. I am running mitmproxy 0.11.4 on Ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks,
Yiannis
