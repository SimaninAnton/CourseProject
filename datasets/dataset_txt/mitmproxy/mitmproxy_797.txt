Greetings,
I just setup mitmproxy according to installation doc and ran following cmd.
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
./mitmproxy -T --host -e
It start but no data show as in opened windows. Any idea what am I doing wrong.
Regards
