Steps to reproduce the problem:

Proxy server listening at http://127.0.0.1:1234
127.0.0.1:49415: clientconnect
127.0.0.1:49415: GET https://example.com/page
 << Server connection to example.com:443 failed: Error connecting to "example.com": [Errno 49] Can't assign requested address
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Works when bind argument isn't specified. Doesn't work on Windows either.
