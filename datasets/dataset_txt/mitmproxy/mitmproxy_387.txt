Steps to reproduce the problem:
Set intercept to google.com, get to the point you can edit the response.
From the edit menu, pick 'a' (response body)
Edit the body, saving the file and close the editor.
Note that the mitmproxy UI will no longer respond to input.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
