Hi
I'm trying to run one of the examples but I keep getting an error from: upsidedownternet.py
mitmdump: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libmproxy/script.py", line 99, in load
execfile(self.argv[0], ns, ns)
File "upsidedownternet.py", line 3, in
from libmproxy.models import decoded
ImportError: No module named models
Since I couldn't find version 0.13 in any of the branches I assumed it was the master branch. (I'm looking to get the decoded to work, so that I can work with gzipped)
Thanks!
