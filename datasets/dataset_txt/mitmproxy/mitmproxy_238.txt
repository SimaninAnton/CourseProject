My tests are messy cause I used mitmproxy and mitmdump, both of them in 4.0.1 and 4.0.3 and now I mixed all cases.
At some point, I think I had an error saying that --confdir was deprecated and had to use "--set confdir=" (I can't reproduce this case though with mitmproxy or mitmdump...)
I spent some time to try to make "--set confdir=" work in a weird bash script and arguments with quotes and maybe it failed due to me.
But I realized --confdir was still working eventually for mitmdump in 4.0.3.
Question to sum up:
Is it attended to have both "--confdir" and "--set confdir=" working at the same time for mitmproxy & mitmdump?
If yes, help (-h) should specify it clearly with something like: "--confdir PATH, --set confdir=PATH"
If not, one of them should be deleted.
