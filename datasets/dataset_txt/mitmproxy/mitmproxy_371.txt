When trying to start mitmproxy in transparent mode and a custom CA directory as followed:
.\mitmweb.exe --set cadir=C:\Users\Admin\Documents\_custom_cert
I get the following output:
192.168.178.40:46345: Transparent mode failure: AttributeError("'Resolver' object has no attribute 'wfile'",)
192.168.178.40:46345: clientdisconnect
I am forwarding port 80 and 443 from my custom router to mitmproxy listening on port 8080.
Any idea what is causing this?
