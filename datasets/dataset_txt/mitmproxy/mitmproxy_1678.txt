I have the following weird issue - when running mitmproxy for a while and attempting to access gmail.com in an Incognito tab - I'm unable to access it. (Just seems to be "loading" forever, nothing is displayed in the tab)
Further viewing of the traffic in Wireshark shows me that upon accessing gmail.com from the incognito tab - It seems that the connection is attempting resume an old connection (no SYN/Client Hello is sent from the client, simply TLS application data)
Has anyone experienced a similar behavior?
