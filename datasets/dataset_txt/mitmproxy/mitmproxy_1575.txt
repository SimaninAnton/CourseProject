Hi,
There are my exact keystrokes:
mitmproxy --host
c
path_to_my_mitm_saved_flows
An nothing gets rendered, I just have a '[0/0] [cplayback:3 to go][showhost]' message in the bottom status bar.
However, as soon as I press a key, the list of flows is diplayed, but they haven't been properly processed : I had tcpdump running in other terminal to check for any traffic, and nothing is sent by mitmproxy:
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 host $target_host -l 2>/dev/null
I previously used the version from Ubuntu repositories, and it worked fine.
Any idea on what is going on ?
I'm using the latest repo version, installed without a virtualenv, on a Ubuntu "trusty" 14.04.1 LTS :
sudo pip install --src . -r requirements.txt
Here is the flows file I'm using, recorded with the same mitmproxy program version:
