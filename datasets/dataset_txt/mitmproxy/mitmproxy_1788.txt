Hey cortesi,
When using the scripting API with a script that raises an error, there is no sign in mitmdump (and I suppose mitmproxy as well) that an error has occured, unless of course you specify the -e option. I really like the event idea, but for a newcomer it might be frustrating not to know that/how his script is failing (there was one such case on irc today, I struggled with this at the beginning as well). I can of course submit a pull request printing all type='error' events to stderr for mitmdump if you would welcome such a change. Any better thoughts?
