Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.mitmproxy in terminal
2.On mobile device, attempt to put proxy in.
3.Device cannot connect to internet
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I've tried multiple wifis, a lot of things, also other proxy programs, I'm unsure what the problem is, any help would be awesome!
