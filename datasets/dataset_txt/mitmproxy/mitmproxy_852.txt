Installing mitmproxy is currently not as easy as it could be:
pip suffers from a lot of issues: New releases of dependencies breaking installations (see e.g. #1533), lxml on Windows (#1444), additional dependencies for compilation on Linux...
Each of our mitmproxy/mitmdump/mitmweb binaries contains all dependencies. This greatly adds to distribution size. On linux, mitmproxy,-dump, and -web are at 67mb now due to this.
It would be nice if our executables would just end up on the PATH.
On Windows, we currently don't have start menu integration. It would be very nice if mitmweb could just be started by clicking on an icon, without opening a command line.
There's no way for users to receive (auto-)updates. We need to be careful here of course, as we don't want any form of tracking.
I stumbled upon https://installbuilder.bitrock.com/ today, which could potentially solve a lot of those issues:
Windows/OSX/Linux installer generation
The usual installer stuff: Generation of shortcuts, install wizard, uninstaller, ...
.deb generation for Linux. Having our own .deb repository would (1) solve the update problem for Linux and (2) we could directly specify our compilation dependencies this way
Auto update and manual update functionality
Free for open source projects
We can have PyInstaller in one-dir mode instead of one-file mode (https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/operating-mode.html#how-the-one-file-program-works)
All together, it may be worth to explore this a bit more. @mitmproxy/devs, thoughts?
