Steps to reproduce the problem:
In mitmproxy console, with a list of flows visible, press 'f' and type:
~hq X-MyMessageTypes
Flows are filtered as expected, to show only those where this request header is present.
press 'f' again clear the filter so all flows are visible again
press 'f' again and paste the following:
~hq X-MyMessageTypes
No flows are displayed.
Typing out the exact same filter works, whereas pasting it in does not. This isn't the case for other view filters such as ~d mydomain, which works either way.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
