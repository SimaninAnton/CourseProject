Steps to reproduce the problem:
Mark multiple flows in the flow list using m key
Toggle to show-marked-only view using M
mitmproxy rearranges flow list when M is toggled
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
This is an issue with the flow list mentioned earlier in #1960. The marked flows can get randomly rearranged whenever M or Z is pressed, as it iterates through view._store which is a dictionary, to refresh the view.
