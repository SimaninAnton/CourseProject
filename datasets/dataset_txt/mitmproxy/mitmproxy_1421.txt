Ok, regarding Foxtel go and play, this is one of the URLs detected by mitmproxy, however I can't play it. I'm not sure whether this is an authentication issue or something else
I was expecting the stream to open, since I had the direct URL, also, when I tried to play it on my iPhone, I got the error message, 'The operation could not be completed'
How to reproduce the issue
Download Foxtel Go, analyse through mitmproxy and look for url's with Telstra in it's name
Platform is iOS
Will also work with Foxtel Play for Windows
