Hi guys,
I'm testing mitmproxy with an Android emulator instance (I must say that your software works properly on a real environment) and I'm getting this annoying error when I try to intercept 'https' communications.
I installed mitmproxy using pip utility, but after getting some errors with pyOpenSSL and netlib I compiled it from sources directly. The version that I'm currently running is 0.10. I generated the certificate and installed it onto the device.
The problem comes when I try to get a page under https, like Twitter, or when I try to use an application like AnyDo, while mitmproxy intercepts without problems http communications, for those ones under https, I'm getting the following error on the emulator: "Connection problem / Couldn't establish a secure connection".
I'm running the emulator as follow:
emulator @avd -http-proxy http://localhost:8080
And mitmproxy/mitmdump with the following flags:
-vvv -z -p 8080 --host
I'm out of ideas, I tried the same using Burp and it works.
Thanks
