Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy
type (in UTF-8) : set view_filter=~bs Троцкий
“Invalid interception filter: ~bs Троцкий”
type : set view_filter=~bs trotskij
the filter is set and correctly limits the view to flows where response body contains “trotskij”
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
mitmproxy should make it possible to filter by arbitrary UTF-8 strings.
I have LANG=en_US.UTF-8; setting LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 doesn’t help.
These don’t work, either:
: set view_filter=~bs "Троцкий" (the quotes are automatically removed after typing the second one)
: set "view_filter=~bs Троцкий"
: set view_filter=~bs /Троцкий/
