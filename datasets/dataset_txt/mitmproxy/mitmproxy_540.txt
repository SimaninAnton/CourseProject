Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump -s wsgi_flask_app.py
2.
Go to example.com and should appear Hello World!
3.
Instead, the original site is shown
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
The sample shows this:
def load(l):
    return wsgiapp.WSGIApp(app, "proxapp.local", 80)
but should be:
def start():
    return wsgiapp.WSGIApp(app, "example.com", 80)
Placing it inside the start() event, returns the expected result
also i´m unable to make the 443 sample to work
