I noticed that I'm a bit reluctant to quickly merge mitmweb PRs as our testing situation there is rather terrible and I have to be very careful when reviewing. As a first step to mitigate this, we should set up a Travis CI job that run the jest tests we have in https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/master/web/src/js/__tests__.
Not sure if the existing tests even run - if not, it's okay to mark the travis job to allow failures and then fix the tests in a separate PR.
