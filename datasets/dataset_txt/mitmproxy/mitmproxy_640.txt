It appears that support for --raw-tcp (apparently now possibly renamed to --rawtcp) was removed in commit fbaade4 citing a move to "explicit control" instead. As far as I can tell it was just removed without a replacement. Was this intentional and, if so, is there any plan to re-add something like it?
Understandably it's difficult to definitely say whether something is raw TCP vs. HTTP but you could check against standard HTTP verbs and fallback to TCP if they're not found.
