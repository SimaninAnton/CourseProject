Steps to reproduce the problem:
run mitmproxy and setup wifi proxy on iOS 11
open mitm.it and install "Apple" SSL certificate
profile installation works fine
open any https website
See the attached screenshots for details. They are in german, but you get the idea.
Error text is the same as for https://expired.badssl.com/ without the proxy.
-> screenshot in english
The certificate doesn't seem to be expired though.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
installed and removed the certificate/profile multiple times
installed the newest mitmproxy Windows version (2.0.2)
