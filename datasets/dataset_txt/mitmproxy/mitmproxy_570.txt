Hey gus. So, I have a fresh kali-rolling installation and mitmproxy is a pre-installed tool. I've used it before and have never run into this issue. Every time I try to run it, I get a python error stating that my distribution is not found (error below).
'typing==3.5.2.2' distribution was not found and is required by mitmproxy
Also, I am unable to look at the mitm version. Thanks for reading! I look forward to fixing this.
