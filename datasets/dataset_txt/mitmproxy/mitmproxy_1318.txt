The embedded tnetstring is 0.2.0
https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/libmproxy/tnetstring.py#L71
The latest is 0.2.1
https://github.com/rfk/tnetstring/blob/master/tnetstring/__init__.py#L51
Perhaps we should consider depending on the package rather than embedding the library.
I encountered an obscure tnetstring error and I thought I should spend my effort working on the tnetstring library rather that some obsolete embedded version.
Also, depending on the library will allow some users to use the _tnetstring.c performance improvements.
Maybe, if necessary we could host a forked version of the library at
https://github.com/mitmproxy/tnetstring if there are mitmproxy specific changes, and that is why the library was embedded in the first place.
Thoughts?
