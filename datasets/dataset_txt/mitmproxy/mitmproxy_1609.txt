Hi,
I tried to use the poc's flags: --ciphers="DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA" --cert-forward
and mitmproxy crashed when i tried to use my iphone.
I debugged a little and found that the crashed was in "ssl3_choose_cipher" function of libssl.(s3_lib.c:3931 to be more specific... )
i'm using ubuntu 14.04 with openssl 1.0.1f (+ubuntu's patches)
which library versions are known to work with these flags?
thanks,
paradox00
