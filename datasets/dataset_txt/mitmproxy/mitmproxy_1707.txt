Hi,
I was running mitmproxy and ran into a very long "GET" line (Facebook causes that quite often). When I pressed "Enter" to view the flow, I was unable to "Go back" to the flow list by pressing "q". Instead - I was displayed with the "Quit?" Dialog and had to restart mitmproxy.
Here is an example (I removed some of the data in the GET request)
Thanks!
