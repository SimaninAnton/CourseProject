Steps to reproduce the problem:
I use the redsocks as a transparent proxy and set the mitmproxy as a upstream-proxy.
In script, I use cli_ip = flow.client_conn.address,but the cli_ip is the redsocks's ip not the client ip.
I want to know how can I get the real client ip?
System information
Mitmproxy version: 2.0.2 (release version)
Ubuntu 3.19.0-25.26~14.04.1-generic 3.19.8-ckt2
