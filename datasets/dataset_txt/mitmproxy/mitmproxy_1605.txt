I tried to implement the example provided to change the upstream proxy and I don't think it is actually working. I have a proxy that I'd like to use as my upstream server XX.XX.XXX.XX:80 and I've implemented it as the example did: flow.live.change_server(XX.XX.XXX.XX:80) and my ip address hasn't been changing at all. Before the update to the code I had been changing it with self.server.config.get_upstream_server. Please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong or if there is a bug.
