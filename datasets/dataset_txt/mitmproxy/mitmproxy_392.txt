From @kajojify:
Enter request-body/response-body editor, then leave it and try to interact with mitmproxy.
Everything was ok with v3.0.0rc2, but v3.0.1 stops reacting on any button.
I can reproduce this on WSL - this needs to be fixed ASAP and probably warrants a bugfix release. I'm unfortunately super busy this weekend, so it'd be great if someone could take a closer look.
