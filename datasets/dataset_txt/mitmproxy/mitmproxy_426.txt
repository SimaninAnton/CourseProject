Steps to reproduce the problem:
Create a configuration file at .mitmproxy/config.yaml
Set this configuration:
mode: "transparent"
showhost: true
Start mitmproxy using this command : "mitmproxy --conf config.yaml" (I'm on the .mitmproxy folder of course)
The process is started but the traffic is not working
Start mitmproxy using this command : "mitmproxy -T --host"
The process is started and the traffic is working
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I tried to use the ":" and "=" as separator for the YAML file but only the ":" is recognized apparently
System information
I have the last release of mitmproxy (v2.0.2)
Well I've just notice that there is a v3 release, maybe this could help me ?
I prefer to create this ticket if someone else has the same issue :)
