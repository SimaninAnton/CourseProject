Steps to reproduce the problem:
Ignore an host impossible to resolve with your current DNS server
Make a request to this DNS name
What is the expected behavior?
The request is ignored and not displayed
What went wrong?
The request is displayed as failed: Server connection to rx-v579:80 failed: Error connecting to "rx-v579": [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I have an application on my Android phone making requests to my AVR. Which is not exposed outside of my LAN. When I'm at the office, I have requests to this domain all day long and can't ignore them.
I tried to ignore rx-v579 and some regex variants, with no luck.
