First off, the mitmproxy project is awesome and has great potential for a project my team and I are starting.
Did I understand correctly that HAR export functionality has recently been added? How can a captured session/flow be exported in the HAR format? I haven't come across anything in your documentation about this.
Ideally there would be command line flags for mitmdump such as "mitmdump -w -format HAR"
Thanks for any feedback
