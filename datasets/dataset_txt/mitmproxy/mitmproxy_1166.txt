In 0.13 I could find and replace "foo" with "bar" anywhere in the headers using the following snippet:
flow.request.headers.replace(context.old, context.new)
The point was to make changes like this in headers:
Before:
Host: foo.com
Cookie: SESSIONID=asdf; domain=asdffoo.com
After:
Host bar.com
Cookie: SESSIONID=asdf; domain=asdfbar.com
However, this same snippet does not work in 0.16. Replacing "foo" with "bar" in the body appears to work fine, however.
Has the functionality changed?
Thanks! :)
