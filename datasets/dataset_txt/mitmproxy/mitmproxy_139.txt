Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
I’m using mitmproxy to capture traffic with my own script (officially called addon). But I can’t find the detailed API doc on web docs (https://docs.mitmproxy.org/archive/v3/addons-overview/) like before (v2 or older version). It is said that I can use command pydoc mitmproxy.http to get the doc. But it can’t work as I’m using the release version I think.
Is there any way to get the detailed script API doc when using release version? Thanks!
