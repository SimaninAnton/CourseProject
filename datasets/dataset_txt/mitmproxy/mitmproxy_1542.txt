Currently, it is impossible to call replay_request in a response script hook.
FlowMaster.replay_request fails if the flow is still live, presumably because RequestReplayThread asks the master which would cause a deadlock. We should
Add an option to RequestReplayThread to not ask the master
Allow replay_request to work if flow.live is set, but suppress asking the master then.
Adjust tests
