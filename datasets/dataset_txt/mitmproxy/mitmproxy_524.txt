I inspect a HTTPS WebSocket traffic with Mitmproxy. Currently I can read/edit WS messages with:
...
class Intercept:
    def websocket_message(self, flow):
        print(flow.messages[-1])
        ...

def start():
    return Intercept()
â€¦ as attached script to Mitmproxy.
Please add a functionality to push/inject our own messages to the client/server. Not edit existing one, but send a new message.
