its not possible to add only one host in proxy.ProxyConfig
libmproxy/proxy/config.py line 55:
ignore_hosts=tuple('.*')

libmproxy/proxy/config.py line 21:
HostMatcher
self.patterns = list(patterns)

when cast tuple to list
the result is ['.', '*'] 
instead ['.*']
workaround is set '.*' twice in ignore_hosts but its ugly...
