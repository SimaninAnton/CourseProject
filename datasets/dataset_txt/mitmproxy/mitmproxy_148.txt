Steps to reproduce the problem:
Go to "https://google.com"
See "captcha" / "We are sorry" page
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
reCaptcha doesn't work when using mitmproxy too so no way to escape that with the default config. (I'm already disabling HTTP/2)
System information
Mitmproxy: 4.0.4
Python:    3.7.2
OpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.0.2q  20 Nov 2018
Platform:  Darwin-17.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
I'm guessing this is based on TLS cyphers signatures like caddy does.
