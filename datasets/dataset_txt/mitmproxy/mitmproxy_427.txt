Hey guys. Thanks for this incredible tool. I tried to write a script that manipulates SNI of TLS connections in all requests and got no problem regarding that.
However when I load a page with video (MPEG-DASH) say a facebook video, the connection quality goes very bad. It takes a long time if it doesn't fail when you want to seek back and forth through a video. Can anybody explain why this happens ?
1. Run mitmdump
mitmdump --listen-port 9990 --ssl-insecure
2. Open Firefox and set it's proxy to localhost:9990
4. Open a video on facebook like this and try to seek randomly.
