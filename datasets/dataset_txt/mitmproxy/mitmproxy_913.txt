Hi,
I'm trying to make this work on a RaspberryPi3 running latest Rasbian "jessie". I've eventually managed to install everything properly (without failures) but in the final step of running the py.test I get all errors.
(venv3) pi@raspberrypi:~/Tools/mitmproxy $ py.test

I have no idea what is the problem and I also have no idea what are the correct dependencies and requirements. They are very vague at best. The project would certainly benefit from better installation instructions and clearly state the various dependencies. For example , there is no place mentioned that Pillow fails because, wheel fails, because libjpeg-dev is not mentioned as a dependency, nor automatically installed. There are several of these similar issues.
So what am I missing to get these tests working?
