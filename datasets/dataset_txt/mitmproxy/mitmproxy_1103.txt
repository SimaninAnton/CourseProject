Steps to reproduce the problem:
Start mitmproxy --port 8080 on my laptop to listen https requests from my Android device.
Open google play app on my Android device which was set the proxy to my laptop. thru "Modify Network" options
The Google Play App could not work well thru the proxy.
What is the expected behavior?
I used the mitmproxy to listen the other mobile apps https requests normally while when I try to intercept the Google Play Store https request. It doesn't work well.
And I turn the mitmproxy event listener. It showed me
Client Handshake failed. The client may not trust the proxy's certificate for android.clients.google.com
What went wrong?
I thought that if the mitmproxy root certificate was not trusted by Google? It would result in the SSL Handshake failed. Is anyone who have met the same issue like this. Please help me out with it.
Any other comments?
Mitmproxy Version: 0.16
Operating System: Mac OSX 10.11
