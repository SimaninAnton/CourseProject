Hey! Super looking tool - i'm trying to figure out how to serve
http://localhost:8888
from
https://www.someOtherDomain.com
without setting a proxy in my browser or app. Is this possible? I don't care if the cert is bad (even though I've installed the mitmproxy cert fine).
I asked a similar question on StackOverflow about this, and got directed to mitmproxy:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25412600/whats-a-simple-way-to-serve-http-localhost-as-https-someotherdomain
but can't quite see how to do this without setting a proxy in my browser, which would be the preferred way for this to work, so I could easily package it up and share it with the rest of the team.
Thanks!
Note: I'm totally fine with having to put the someOtherDomain.com entry in my hosts file manually, to manage that part of it.
