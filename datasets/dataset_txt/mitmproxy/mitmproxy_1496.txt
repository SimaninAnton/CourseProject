A clean npm install shows the following:

npm ERR! peerinvalid The package react does not satisfy its siblings' peerDependencies requirements!

Transparently, there is an compatibility issue between react-router and react at the moment.
A few days ago, package react v0.13.0 published, but an amount of packages which suits to react@0.12.x only haven't updated yet.
Simply modify the package.json would work.
