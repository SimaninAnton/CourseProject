Hey guys,
I'm on the current master branch. I use mitmdump scripts for logging information about incoming connections. I wrote several addons which are used simultaneously.
Now, I want to log hosts/targets for which a TLS Handshare could not be established. What is the best way to do this? Are there callbacks for this case, like there is for request and response?
Help is much appreciated!
Cheers
