Hi! Thanks for the tool it helped me to do a project. I'm testing mobile apps in Android and I'm done with the normal testing (capturing the https traffic through mitmproxy to find out ssl flaws) . Now I need to do the same testing but with expired certificates, Cortesi, there is a way you can show me how to replicate those certificates? I'm trying to replicate them with makecert in windows and they seem similar but when I'm trying to test, the apps through "handshake" errors. Please let me know if you can help me.
Thanks
