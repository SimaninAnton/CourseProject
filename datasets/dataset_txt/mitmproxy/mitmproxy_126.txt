Hi,
I'll go straight to the point:
I'm trying to understand if it's possible to inject all the traffic coming from a specific ip address and leaving all the other clients with the traffic untouched.
i've even tried using a regex like this via --ignore-hosts (assuming that i only want to inject 192.168.1.42) :
^(?!192\.168\.1\.42)((?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9]))$
or the opposite
^192\.168\.1\.42$
but it didn't work.
I've looked at the API but nothing, so im here to ask if its possible to do something like that even passing a script -s myscript.py and checking the specific ip address of the client.
i've checked all the arguments inside the webui panel but i didnt find something useful.
can someone help me ?
