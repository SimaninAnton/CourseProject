I've been reading up on http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/certinstall.html and there are 4 certificate files.
mitmproxy-ca.pem, mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem, mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12, mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer
Since I am not very familiar with crypto, I wanted to ask, for Windows in particular, if the private key is required in order to install the certificate and for mitmproxy to function correctly?
mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12 is a file that contains both public and private keys, but is the private key really required on Windows to install as a Trusted Root CA, or can I also use mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer which I presume is just the public key?
