Steps to reproduce the problem:
Not sure how to reproduce that issue, but I believe it happened when I switched off the wifi on my android device. Said device was communicating with a server through mitmdump.
The issue occurred once, and mitmdump continued operating normally.
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Not a blocking issue, so I went on with business as usual, thankful that I didn't even have to restart mitmdump.
System information
mitmdump 1.0.2
Crash log attached.
