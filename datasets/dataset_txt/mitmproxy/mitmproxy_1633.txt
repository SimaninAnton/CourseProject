I have been struggling to change the contents of a POST request.
Example: in the below request, i want to change everthing between the words START and END (see last line below) before the request is sent to the server. Can you give me a hand here? I tried e.g. flow.request._assemble(), but that merely enables me to write the POST request to a log file. I currently do not know which HTTPRequest method to use here. -Although I would think there might be a rather straight forward solution for this one.
