When opening Keychain app on High Sierra (with Supplemental Update), Keychain hangs (with rainbow mouse cursor) and Console fills up with more than 20000 messages like this one:
CSSM Exception: -2147413750 CSSMERR_DL_INVALID_FIELD_NAME
When I remove mitmproxy-2.0.2 certs, there is no problem opening the Keychain app. The process of removing both certs hangs Keychain for about 1-2 minutes as well. On El Capitan there was no such problem.
