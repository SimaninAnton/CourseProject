Features Needed:
Socks Mode With Upstream Proxy
HTTP Mode With Socks Upstream Proxy
Background Story:
While developing PyMultitor (Proxy Version) I used MitmProxy as a infrastructure,
My problem was that i couldn't use socks proxy on upstream mode,
My simple solution was to use requests + pySocks on request handler and then translate the response.
This solution will not work on tcp packets - that means that websockets won't work.
I Hope in the future to remove the use of requests and i will be able to support websockets.
