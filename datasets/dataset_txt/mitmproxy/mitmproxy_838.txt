I get the following error message (example.com replaced with actual website) and can't figure out why and what to do about it:
<< Cannot establish TLS with webmail.chalmers.se:443 (sni: None): TlsException('Cannot validate certificate hostname without SNI',)
Steps to reproduce the problem:
mitmdump -vw filename
Connect (add as proxy) with android phone and install certificate (using mitmproxy.it)
Connect to some server
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
It seems to work for some https-sites but not others. Examples that cause the errors are webmail.chalmers.se and m.handelsbanken.se.
