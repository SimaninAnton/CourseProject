I'm new in mitmproxy so I have a question why I can't figure out how to put mitmproxy inside my python script(my purpose is just to make some modify with the request and analyze response)
I'm found this but this doesn't work anymore
https://gist.github.com/dannvix/5285924#example-of-proxypy
and
https://2qwesgdhjuiytyrjhtgdbf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting/mitmproxy.html#examples-stickycookies
So I wonder why are you guys refer using
mitmproxy -s sample.py
instead of do some configuration inside python script like
config = proxy.ProxyConfig(port=8080)
server = ProxyServer(config)
then just run sample.py script.
