Hi,
When attempting to run mitmproxy with a DH cipher suite and the "-e" parameter, I'm getting the following error:
error: 502: SSL handshake error: [('SSL routines','SSL3_GET_CLIENT_HELLO', 'no shared cipher')]
When I tried setting "ALL" - it did work successfully.
Does anyone have an idea of what can be the problem? I attempted many clients/other variations of DH but it failed to work.
