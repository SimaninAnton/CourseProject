Steps to reproduce the problem:
I am going to do a passive scan project recently.So found this great third-party library.But I have a problem with calling pymproxy on the python3 extension api libmproxy. Unfortunately, I did not find it, but my English was bad. Would like to ask in python3 there is no similar api. Many thanks
