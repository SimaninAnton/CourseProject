Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.Launch mitmweb
2.Save some flow
3.Load those flows
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tools/web/app.py
Lines 238 to 239 in 0fa1280
 for i in io.FlowReader(bio).stream(): 
     asyncio.call_soon(self.master.load_flow, i) 
I replaced this line with asyncio.ensure_future(self.master.load_flows(i)) to make the loading works.
