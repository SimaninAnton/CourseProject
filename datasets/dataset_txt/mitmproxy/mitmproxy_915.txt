Steps to reproduce the problem:
proxy with mitmproxy with http/socks5
set the proxy in chrome
response is very slow
proxy with charles
set the proxy in chrome
response is very fast
What is the expected behavior?
expect the mitmproxy works almost the same proxy speed, at least now so much slower than charles
What went wrong?
when use mitmproxy, web pages took much more time to complete all the requests
Any other comments? What have you tried so far?
Mitmproxy Version: mitmproxy 0.18.1
Operating System: OS X 10.11.6 (15G1004)
