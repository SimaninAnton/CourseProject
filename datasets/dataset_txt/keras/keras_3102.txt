Hi everyone,
I read over some forums, than train keras models with cuDNN ( who is nondeterministic) could result in error if we train a model with cuDNN and infer this model on a CPU (So with no cuDNN)
Do you know how to fix this problem ? (If there is a fix)
I read we can play with the seed but how ? And why ?
Thanks!
