Not sure what the behavior in this case ought to be (don't print anything but still keep the stats internally?) but right now it gives an exception:
/Users/brettnaul/Dropbox/Documents/keras/keras/callbacks.py in on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs)
    264
    265     def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
--> 266         if self.seen < self.target:
    267             self.log_values = []
    268

AttributeError: 'ProgbarLogger' object has no attribute 'target'
It looks like the fix could be as easy as changing on_epoch_begin to still set target, etc. regardless of the value of verbose.
