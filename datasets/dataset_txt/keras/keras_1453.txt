Hi everyone,
I have been playing Faster RCNN in this depreciated repo: https://github.com/yhenon/keras-frcnn
Before my computer broke down on me GTX1080Ti (CUDA 7.0, cuDNN v3) in Ubuntu 14.04. I was able to run this repo straight-off and train/test my system without an issue.
I rebuild my software environment setup running on GTX1080Ti (CUDA 8.0, cuDNN v6) in Ubuntu 14.04.
The first thing I did was to download the stock repo and run the program to which I had the shock of my life:
"Exception: Error when checking target: expected rpn_out_regress to have shape (None, None, None, 36) but got array with shape (1, 38, 67, 72)"
I am wondering if anyone knows what I can do about it? I think the code is fine since I could run previously (exactly the same code)!
Sincerely,
Kenny
