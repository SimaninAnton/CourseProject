Hi,
Would you please be able to provide more explanation in the comments for the Keras code (or at least the papers that are relevant to the underlying theory in the docs on the website), similar to Keras, for the Keras tutorials and the general documentation? I have the code running with the binary installation (not the source installation) so I need a way to guide my intuition so that i can build complex deep layered models.
Thanks!
Best regards,
Shyamal Chandra
