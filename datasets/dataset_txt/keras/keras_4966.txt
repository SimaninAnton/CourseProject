When multiple processes import keras simultaneously, there is a race condition with reading/writng the ~/.keras/keras.json file here: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/backend/__init__.py#L15-L47. One process can be in the middle of writing the file while the other is trying to read it, leading to a failure when the reading process tries to decode the JSON.
