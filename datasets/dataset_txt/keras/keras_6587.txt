We have made good progress on our current directions, with the introduction of automated shape inference. Here's a recap to help synchronize our community efforts.
What should be our priority right now:
abstracting Theano functionality into a modular Keras back-end.
What should be our number 2 priorities:
Stricter checks of assumptions throughout the codebase.
Proper docstrings everywhere as per @matsuyamax's remarks.
As a follow-up, autogenerated docs (all classes / functions specifications).
Simpler, faster unit tests.
Faster compilation of complex graphs via tensor caching (see #666).
What we need to work on, but isn't as urgent:
New, simpler API for the Graph model (still TBD).
Recurrent Container (@EderSantana, you seemed to be pretty close to this).
Stateful RNNs.
Ability to reinitialize weights without recompiling.
Simpler way of handling loss weighting and masking (I though @EderSantana's objective function decorator was a great idea).
A proper parameter naming system (might be introduced as part of the backend).
Caffe model importing (@pranv).
