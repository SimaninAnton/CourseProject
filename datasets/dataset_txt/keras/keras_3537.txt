Both Theano and Tensorflow support (at least) the following basic trigonometric functions that are not currently in keras.backend:
tan
arccos
arcsin
arctan
As far as I can tell, Theano has supported these since version 0.6 and Tensorflow since v0.8.0. It's not listed in the TF release notes, but see this commit.
It should be simple to add these functions to both Keras backends. Is this a good idea? If so, I'm happy to submit the pull request.
