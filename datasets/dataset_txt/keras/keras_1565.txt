Inside ImageDataGenerator there is a flow_from_dir, allowing to use images for training from disk
In case of multi class problem right now it is possible to use only something like this:
classes= [ 'dogs' , 'cats' , 'cars' ]
Is it useful to add support for multiclasses versus one class, like this:
classes = [ [ 'dogs' , 'cats' ] , 'cars' ] ?
In this case images from 'cats' and 'dogs' directories will have the same label
I can implement this by myself, but need to know if it needed by community
