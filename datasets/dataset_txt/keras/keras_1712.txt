there are four graphics cards in my machine, I would like to use the specified graphics card, in the previous version of keras and tensorflow, the following code is normal operation, but after updating to the latest version of keras and tensorflow, the following code does not work.
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "1"
from keras.backend.tensorflow_backend import set_session
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.5
set_session(tf.Session(config=config))
