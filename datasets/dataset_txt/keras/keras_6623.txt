In the documentation, the parameters class_weight/sample_weight are described as being applied only during training. Furthermore, the functions evaluate and test_on_batch don't have those parameters according to the documentation.
Nevertheless, in the actual code, both function do have sample_weight but not class_weight as a parameter. This is unnecessarily confusing. Both functions should probably have either both or none of the parameters. Also, the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual interface.
I can implement those changes, but I'd have to know which solution is preferred.
Also, in sklearn, class_weight can be set to 'auto'. This automatically calculates the weights based on the number of samples in each class. Would you accept a pull request for this feature?
