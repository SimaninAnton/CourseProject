I have a target variable having 0 and 1. i want to predict the probability after doing supervised learning(Decision tree classifier) that whether 0 will be chosen or 1.The implementation for that is given below.
clf_A = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10)
dt_1=clf_A.fit(X_train,y_train)
clf_proba=dt_1.predict_proba(X_test)
But on printing clf_proba the output which i am getting is this
`array([ 1.,  0.])`
So where am i going wrong ?
