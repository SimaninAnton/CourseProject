I'm pretty new to machine learning and Keras, and running into a model/data configuration issue.
Let's say my data is structured like so:
[len(sentences), maxlen, len(chars)] as the input
And I want
[len(sentences), maxlen, len(chars)] as the output
What do I need to do to the input for the LSTM model to accept it? In addition, what changes would I need to do to input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars)) in the first LSTM layer in the model?
I keep getting this error: Exception: Error when checking model target: expected activation_1 to have 2 dimensions, but got array with shape (100L, 9L, 15L)
Thank you for your time.
