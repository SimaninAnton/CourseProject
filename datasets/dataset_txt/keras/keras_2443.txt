[Not sure it's the base place to post about it]
I'm trying to run the layer activation demo: https://blog.keras.io/category/demo.html
It's referencing a variable input_img that's not defined in the tutorial. I'm struggling to grasp what it should be since I expect the value that maximizes the layer to be independent from any input consideration. Should it just be a random input to start the optimization process?
