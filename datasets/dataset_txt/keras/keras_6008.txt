We have this error on a sequential model with multiple inputs:
keras sequential object as no attribute validation data
We have the same error for the graph:
keras graph object as no attribute validation data
It does work on fit !!
Is it normal?
mix_model.fit_generator(trainBatchBuilder.seq_batch_generator(), 100, 5, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test), callbacks=[TensorBoard("path/tensorboard_logs/", 1)])
Am I missing something?
