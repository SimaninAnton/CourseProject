I install keras through "sudo pip install keras"
then , I run command "python imdb_cnn.py" in example packge, it refer "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'relu'"
log is here :

my sys is ubuntu 14.04 LTS
here is the pip install keras referencet

Cleaning up...
plz see what the problem thankyou!
