A new paper from Lee et al. details a new, simplified recurrent neural network dubbed the "Recurrent Additive Network." It seems to do well on language modeling tasks when compared to the LSTM, despite using simpler computation with less parameters. This model would be easy to implement in Keras as a subclass of Recurrent, and I'd be happy to do it. However, my question is: is this something that would be pulled into the main repo? What is the standard policy for adding new sorts of RNNs?
