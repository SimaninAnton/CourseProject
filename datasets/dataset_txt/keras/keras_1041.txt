As the title say, thank you!
Checkpoint the weights for best model
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint
checkpoint
filepath="weights.best.hdf5"
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_acc', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='max')
callbacks = [checkpoint]
Fit the model
model.fit(X, Y, validation_split, epochs, batch_size, callbacks=callbacks, verbose=0)
