I am trying to define a custom loss, which is implemented in an external routine (sometimes not even python).
Essentially I would like to extract (y_true, y_pred) as numpy arrays to feed into my routine, which will return a value that I can then feed back to Keras. Is this possible?
`
from keras import backend as K
def _loss(y_true,y_pred):
    tf_session = K.get_session()
    y_true_matrix = y_true.eval(session = tf_session)
    y_pred_matrix = y_pred.eval(session = tf_session)
    distance = external_routine(y_true_matrix, y_pred_matrix)
    return K._to_tensor(distance, dtype=DT_FLOAT)
`
