Hellow!
I made an experiment and found a interesting question that there is a little difference between "optimize a model for 100 epoch" and " optimize a model with 1epoch for 100 times."
optimize a model for 100 epoch
    model.fit(X , Y, nb_epoch=100, batch_size=50)

    outcome_1=model.predict(X, batch_size=50)
optimize a model with 1epoch for 100 times iterations
  for i in range(0,100):

       model.fit(X , Y, nb_epoch=1, batch_size=50

       i+=1
  outcome_2=model.predict(X, batch_size=50)
I am confused to these two different outcomes (although the difference is small)
Is anybody know the reason why??
Will there be any bias if I choose optimize a model with 1epoch for 100 times iterations rather than optimize a model for 100 epoch?
Thank you for help!
