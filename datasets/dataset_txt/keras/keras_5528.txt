In keras 1.0.0, I can no longer use Merge with a Graph model as an input:
    from keras.models import Sequential, Graph
    from keras.layers import Dense, Merge

    model1 = Sequential()
    model1.add( Dense( 1, input_dim=1))

    model2 = Graph()
    model2.add_input(name='test_input', input_shape=(1,))
    model2.add_node( Dense(1), input='test_input', name='test_layer' )
    model2.add_output(name='test_output', input='test_layer')

    joint = Sequential()
    joint.add( Merge([model1, model2], mode='concat'))```
The above code results in
Exception: The layer has never been called and thus has no defined output shape.
this worked in earlier versions of keras, e.g., 0.3.3.
This is a useful architecture for many problems, such as learning document similarity.
