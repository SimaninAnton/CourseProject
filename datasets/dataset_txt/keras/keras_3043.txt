Hi all,
i want to implement a multiple instance learning using keras. I first separate the data into bags, each bag has different number of instances. Could I ask is it possible to consider a bag as a batch, and create an objective function which take the argmax value of predicted probability for the batch with the true label for this bag. any suggestion about how to implement it? thanks
