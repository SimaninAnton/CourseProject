Hi,
I'm not attaching any code as it is not specific to any form of my model. Im running keras with tensorflow, everything is up to date.
When I run keras inside pytho notebook (python 3) and try to train a model multiple time to search optimal parameters it gets slower with each iteration. For example from 3 min per iteration to 6 min in 40 iterations. I run a function that builds new model = sequential() in each iteration.
I looked for any command to "restart" tensorflow or keras but couldn't find anything. Is it a bug or am I doing something wrong?
Kind regards.
