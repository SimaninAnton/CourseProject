I have data instances as-
X = [ [t1,f11,f21], [t2,f12,f22], [t3,f13,f23]]  # t1-time and f11,f21- features
Y = [        0,           1,          ?        ]   #we need to predict '?' here
Let’s say for training the model, we know at t1 (for features f11,f21), the class is 0 and similarly in the next time step, at t2 (for features f12,f22), the class is 1, so finally we need to predict whether for the next time step t3 (for features f13,f23), the class is 1 or 0 or (probability).
In short, given a sequence of three inputs, if the first two inputs gives output 0 and 1 respectively then what would be the output of the third input in the sequence based on the learning from the first two inputs. So its just the prediction of output(0/1) of the last instance based on the previous instances' inputs and outputs in the sequence.
How can I input this into RNN using Keras? Can TimeDistributed Layer be applied in this case?
