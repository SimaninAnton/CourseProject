I modified the LSTM architecture a little bit in the recurrent.py and then save it as recurrent_m1.py. Then I import the modified LSTM for my work as follows:
 from keras.layers.recurrent_m1 import LSTM 
Run the training code using the modified LSTM as follows:
model.add(LSTM())   #I omit the contents in the ()
model.fit()  #I have omitted some other irrelevant codes for creating a sequential model
Training the model does not show much difference from that using the original LSTM. So I am wondering if the model is really implementing the modified LSTM in the recurrent_m1.py.
I want to know some debug ways to show that the program being running is implementing the modified LSTM class? I have tried to add some print codes in the section of class LSTM(Recurrent) in the recurrent_m1.py as follows:
print ('Modified LSTM is being used...') 
# the code is added following the '''.... class explanation and arguments stuff...'''
However, running the mode.fit() does not show the printing results.
