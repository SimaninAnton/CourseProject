I'd like to extend the CNN-LSTM example to include additional information that should be passed through the CNN, but added directly to the LSTM alongside the features extracted with the CNN. How would I do that?
I imagine that is relevant in many use cases as there's often interesting metadata associated with images or text. For instance, I have a case similar to the CNN-LSTM text example, where I also have the time of day, geographical location and other information related to the text being examined. The dimensions of the added metadata to the LSTM is only ~10 with some features being one-hot encoded and others being continuous.
