I just used the example script examples/babi_memnn.py and added the saving code at the end of the file.
json_string = answer.to_json()
open('my_model_architecture.json', 'w').write(json_string)
answer.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5', overwrite=True)
And after the training is finished I try to load the model with
from keras.models import model_from_json
model = model_from_json(open('my_model_architecture.json').read())
model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
and then get the Exception: You are trying to load a weight file containing 11 layers into a model with 13 layers.
