There's a precision problem with keras/theano vs numpy.
I have:
np.set_printoptions(precision=22)
K.set_epsilon(1e-20)
And am using either K.Sum() or T.Sum() vs np.Sum()
If I add these values:
[[ 1.7117279052734375000000e+01, 1.7255817413330078125000e+01,

1.7255817413330078125000e+01, 2.2046510696411132812500e+01,

In numpy I get:
5.706986 7324829101562500e+02

In Keras/theano I get:
5.706986 6943359375000000e+02


The problem is that as the calculations progress the level of error increases to the point that they're unusable.
Does anybody have any ideas please on how to get higher precision since setting a smaller epsilon didn't work?
