I've written a model and I want to plug it as the input to another model that is exactly the same. Running by intuition I wrote the following:
model_half = Model(input=inputs, output=conv4)
model = Sequential([model_half, model_half])
which compiles fine but as soon as the code starts fitting I get the following ValueError:
ValueError: ('this shared variable already has an update expression', (convolution2d_28_W, Elemwise{sub,no_inplace}.0))
Just to make it clear, the code runs perfectly when model = model_half and output dimensions match input. Is there a systematic, clean way to do what I'm trying to do? Is there a reason why my approach should simply not work?
Thanks a lot in advance for any help. I think there's no need for more details from my code but I can upload it on GitHub if needed.
