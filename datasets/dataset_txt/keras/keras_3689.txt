Hi could someone possibly provide some hints on what exactly is going wrong with predict_generator method since fit.generator worked just fine.
Here's the code snippet and the error that I get:
> predictions = model.predict_generator(test_generator, nbr_test_samples)
(Pdb) n
Exception: Exceptio...one...',)
predictions = model.predict_generator(test_generator, nbr_test_samples)
(Pdb) Exception in thread Thread-1:

    current_index = (self.batch_index * batch_size) % N
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
Furthermore the directory that I'm providing as input to the ImageDataGenrator has 1000 images inside but when I run the code I get a message saying Found 0 images in 0 classes. I understand the 0 classes part since I didn't specify any classes as argument to ImageDataGenerator since this is the test dataset. But, I don't understand the Found 0 images.
To me the message I would expect to see isFound 1000 images in 0 classes. Am I correct? or Am I missing something?
How can I overcome this error?
Thanks!
