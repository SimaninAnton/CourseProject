I have a model trained using model.fit() and used model.save() to save it on a physical file. Now, I have another data-set on which I want to resume training with the saved model. But, I found that every fit() call is been considered as a fresh training. That means, it is re-initialising the weights which was generated and saved before.
When I called fit() with epochs 0, then I do not see the weight reset problem. But, I definitely want to try with epochs > 0.
Am I missing something here, or is it an issue with Keras.
Keras version: 2.0.3
Thanks.
