I dont think there is support for scalar input to Merge class in 'mul' merge_mode. It checks if they are the same size.
Is there any way around this? I tried making a new merge_mode = 'mul_scalar' to be able to multiple a scalar input to a 4d tensor. In this case the output shape is the same as the 4d tensor but it gives me the output shape of (None,1,1) instead.
