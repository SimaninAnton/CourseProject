For a RNN model, during model.fit_generator() the batch generator calls model.reset_states() occasionally, which works with Theano but results in the following error with TensorFlow:
ValueError: Tensor("Placeholder:0", shape=(16, 2048), dtype=float32) must be from the same graph as Tensor("Variable:0", shape=(16, 2048), dtype=float32_ref).
(built TensorFlow from source just now and using the latest Keras version)
