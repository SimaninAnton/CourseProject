here is my model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(256, input_shape=(None, 1),return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))

model.add(LSTM(256, input_shape=(None, 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))


model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])


model.summary()
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=2, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
and I want to know next time series So, I did
y_test[-1] and predicted lastY gap is too large
am I wrong? or something error code?
I do not know why this happened. The difference between the last value and the next predicted value is very large.
