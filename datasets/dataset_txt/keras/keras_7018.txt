Hi all,
I want to use Keras to train a CNN model for classfication. As I know, there are many public pre-trained CNN models, like VGG, ImageNet etc. But unfortunately, these pre-trained models are generated with other CNN framework, like caffe or cuda-convnet. How can we use these kinds of pre-trained models or weights to initialize a Keras sequential model and then do the finetuning training?
Thanks
Dr. Wu
