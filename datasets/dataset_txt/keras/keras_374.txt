Hi,
I'd like to learn some detail code about Models for image classification, such as VGG16, ResNet50, However, when i open keras.application folder. I can not really understand the code for these models. For example, VGG16, the code is on the below:
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

from keras_applications import vgg16
from . import keras_modules_injection


@keras_modules_injection
def VGG16(*args, **kwargs):
    return vgg16.VGG16(*args, **kwargs)


@keras_modules_injection
def decode_predictions(*args, **kwargs):
    return vgg16.decode_predictions(*args, **kwargs)


@keras_modules_injection
def preprocess_input(*args, **kwargs):
    return vgg16.preprocess_input(*args, **kwargs)
So where can I see the detail code for these networks?
