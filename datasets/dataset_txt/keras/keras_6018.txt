Dear all,
I would like to use ImageDataGenerator with a regression problem (detect facial key points - https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection). By looking at the code I've got the feeling that_ y_ value is not modified when images are transformed.
Is that true ?
If so are you planning to support a kind of regression mode in parallel to the classification one
