I have a access to a cluster having multiple cores and I want to run my keras model on limited number of cores of that cluster. Is there any way to use fix number of cores in a cluster.
I have looked in to multi core support for theano but in that there is no way to control number of cores except threads as per my understanding. Also does openmp uses all available cores by default because I have not found any flag in theano which can tell openmp that how many cores to use
Thank you
