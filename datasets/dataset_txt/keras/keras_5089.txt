@fchollet provides a fantastic blog post introducing Autoencoders named Building Autoencoders in Keras. The convolutional Autoencoder is interesting as below:
As far as I understand, the encoding phase consists of convolutions and down-sampling for feature extraction purpose. On the contrary, the decoding part is done by convolutions and up-sampling to recover the original input. I am reading paper "Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation" . It designs a Deconvolutuion Network for semantic segmentation which is composed of convolutional and deconvolutuional layers. The so-called deonv layer is expected to play the same role with the conv layer in the decoding phase in the blog post. I would like to ask that whether there is already an implementation of such kind of layer?
