Nowadays, I researched how to using keras to train multi-inputs model.
Concretely, the inputs include a few of unlabeled data and few of labeled data.
I try to using as follows:
model.train_on_batch([unlabeled_x,labeled_x],[unlabeled_y,labeled_y])
or with fit():
model.fit([unlabeled_x,labeled_x],[unlabeled_y,labeled_y],batch_size=2, nb_epoch=1,verbose=1)
Because I have lots of unlabeled_x, I wanna set the batch_size of it be larger than labeled_x's.
But both of these two methods require the batch_size of unlabeled_x and labeled_x is equal, or keras will throw out error message.
What should I do? Anyone can help me? Many thanks.
