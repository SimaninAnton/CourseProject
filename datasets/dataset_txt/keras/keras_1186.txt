(As the issue is related to making predictions on a subset of ImageNet pictures I can not include a code that does not require external data download)
I make class predictions on the following dataset, which is a dog only subset of ImageNet images:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
Image preprocessing
Image size: 331*331 pixels
Image preprocessing: preprocess_input() from keras.applications.inception_v3
Data augmentation: No
Models
I tested the below listed Keras models with “include top” option, and ImageNet weights, no modification whatsoever
I use predict_generator() to make the predictions
Top 1 accuracy results
NASNetLarge: !!!51.21%!!!
InceptionResNetV2: 92.61%
Xception: 92.31%
Environment:
Ububtu 17
Keras 2.1.4
Cuda V8.0.61
CuDNN 7.0.5
