This is a followup of another issue #1779. I upgraded to the latest version after the bugfix in #1801.
Now I am getting another strange error for the argument of the Lambda layer when I do model.compile(loss={'output':'categorical_crossentropy'}, optimizer='rmsprop'),
def get_R(X):
    return K.dot(X[0], X[1])


line 1482, in get_output
    return func(X)
line 83, in get_R
    return K.dot(X[0], X[1])
KeyError: 0
Here is the gist to reproduce.
Is the bug still persisting in the Lambda Layer?
