I want to decode predictions from non-ImageNet trained models but Places 2 Database.
More specifically I want to Classify Places classes with VGG16-places365 taken from https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Keras-VGG16-places365, however the custom decode_predictions function returns the same results always. Any thoughts on this or how to write the necessary custom function?
