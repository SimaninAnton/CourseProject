When I use the Lambda layer，I write a layer myself which is as follows:
AverageConsensus = Lambda(function=lambda x: K.mean(x, axis=0),
                   output_shape=lambda shape: shape[1:])
However, when I add this layer to a Sequential model, there are errors:
    model.add(AverageConsensus())
TypeError: __call__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
I have checked the document and there are examples just like mime, that only take x as the input arguments.
So I don't know where is wrong....
