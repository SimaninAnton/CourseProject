Recently, the weights for DenseNet have been ported to Keras from the Caffe version in https://github.com/flyyufelix/DenseNet-Keras. However, it depends on a custom Scale layer for BatchNorm, which is not needed in Keras.
Therefore I have transferred the weights to a model builder which does not require such custom Scale layers and there is currently a PR in Keras Contrib to update the DenseNet application there with the weights keras-team/keras-contrib#144.
@fchollet Would it be better for Keras proper to have DenseNet as an application, and contrib to have just the DenseNet Fully Convolutional Network ? Or should both DenseNet and DenseNet-FCN remain in contrib for the time being?
