When the user sets ~/.keras/keras.json floatX to be float64 but THEANO_FLAGS has floatX=float32, Keras should send a Warning to the user on intialization of THEANO backend.
Otherwise, the behavior users would see would be. Theano code would run on the GPU, then Keras would run on the CPU. In many cases, this is very hard to detect. Setting different floatX is almost always a bad configuration. The user would appreciate the warning message.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
