Here is an example of a case where Theano and Tensorflow differ in their behavior with respect to the K.squeeze function. Essentially, K.squeeze(x, 2) doesn't perform as it should in the example I provided, but only when using the Theano backend.
Has anyone else encountered this? Is this indeed a bug? If so, do folks have thoughts about what could be potentially not working?
#3420 also mentions an issue with this function in the Theano backend, though I'm not sure if this is exactly the same issue
