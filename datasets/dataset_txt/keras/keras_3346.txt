I need to perform a different operation on each tensor slice. Therefore I need to know the batch size inside a keras layer. The call function of my layer is written below:
    def call(self, inputs, mask=None):
        x = inputs
        input_shape = K.int_shape(inputs[0])
        timesteps = input_shape[1]
        x = K.reshape(x, (-1,)+ input_shape[2:])
        new_input_shape = K.int_shape(x)
        for i in range(new_input_shape[0]): #cant do this currently
            p1 = x[i, :, :, :] #some slice operation
           
Currently the code does not go into the loop as new_input_shape[0] is None. Can I somehow get the batch size?
