Currently many layers such as Dense have activity_regularizer as a param but this is lacking in recurrent layers. I believe it would be useful to have this for recurrent layers as well. This allows to use either available or customized activity regularizer on the output of the recurrent networks. Currently one can use ActivityRegularization Layer to add available l1 l2 regularizer to any layer but that cannot be directly used for arbitrary regularizer.
