In the documentation, it happens that the references are rendered as plain text instead of a hyperlink.
See here a case where it's wrong and rendered as plain text: https://keras.io/layers/advanced-activations/#leakyrelu . Displayed like this: [Rectifier Nonlinearities Improve Neural Network Acoustic Models] (https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/relu_hybrid_icml2013_final.pdf)
See here the case where it's nicely rendered as a hyperlink: https://keras.io/layers/advanced-activations/#prelu
It's likely something easy to fix, like a space/newline at the wrong place or something like that. If somebody could fix all those broken references (there are more than one broken in the docs), it'd be cool.
