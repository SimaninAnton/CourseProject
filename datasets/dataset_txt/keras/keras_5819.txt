I want to implement the recurrent model explained in eqn 11,12,13 of this paper. As far as I understand, I need to subclass the recurrent layer from keras, but I do not understand where is the state being glued together. eg. In GRU,
        x_z = x[:, :self.output_dim]
        x_r = x[:, self.output_dim: 2 * self.output_dim]
        x_h = x[:, 2 * self.output_dim:]
But where do I stitch the vectors together?
