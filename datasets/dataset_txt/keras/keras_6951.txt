Hi Fchollet:
I intend to change the loss function in the model.compile, and I find that in the file of objective functions, the "y_pred" is regarded as input. I want to know where is this "y_pred" calculated? For example, in softmax regression, it is the process of y_pred = T.argmax(self.p_y_given_x, axis=1).
Cheers,
