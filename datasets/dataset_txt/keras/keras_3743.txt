I'm trying to train each part of a model separately, like in this piece of code:
from keras.layers import Merge
left_branch = Sequential()
left_branch.add(Dense(2, input_dim=4,name='left'))
right_branch = Sequential()
right_branch.add(Dense(1, input_dim=4))
merged = Merge([left_branch, right_branch], mode='concat')
final_model = Sequential()
final_model.add(merged)
final_model.add(Dense(1, activation='softmax'))
How could I get weights from the right branch after training process?
Thanks
