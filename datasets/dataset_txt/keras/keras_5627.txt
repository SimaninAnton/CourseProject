Hi.I'm confused about the validation data.
My code is:
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=nb_epoch,verbose=2,
validation_data= (X_val, y_val))
I understand that the validation data is used to evaluate the accuracy of model after each epoch. It helps when I use earlystopping. Is there any other functions of validation data?
The Keras documents says that:
If you set the validation_split argument in model.fit to e.g. 0.1, then the validation data used will be the last 10% of the data. If you set it to 0.25, it will be the last 25% of the data, etc.
If I want to have choose validation data randomly, what should I do?
Can I use Cross-validation in Keras? If yes, can you tell me how to use it in Keras?
Thank you very much in advance!
