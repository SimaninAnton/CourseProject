Hi,
I am trying to use keras for imbalance datasets (0.05 vs. 0.95).
I implemented it with return_sequences=true (output for each input) in RNN.
The output is 1 hot vector (for example with 7 outputs).
How should I do it? Should I use class_weight? how?
And how should I do it when I am using masking (I have 1 output neuron for all masked/padded input).
Thanks
