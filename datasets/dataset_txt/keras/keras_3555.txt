Are there plans/interest in incorporating training ability for the use of stochastic units in hidden layers?
For example, some of the methods described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3432.pdf or the original REINFORCE paper.
I think this would be a very useful addition for the rising popularity of variational methods. As far as I can tell there is currently no support for training a custom layer that has stochastic neuron, for example binomial neurons that are drawn from a previous layer with sigmoid outputs.
