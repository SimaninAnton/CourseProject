Hello,
I have a problem with the way of creating my data for a NN with a LSTM layer. I have many files containing hundreds of lines. Each file represents a song and each line represents a note with 4 values. I want the NN read the notes with a sequence of 10 notes so that it can predict one note from them. If it is needed, we can fix the number of notes at 1000 per song.
So I just want to know which shape has to have my data and how to define the first LSTM layer.
Thank you for your help.
