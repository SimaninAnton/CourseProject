i'm writing custom elementwise multiplication layers in keras using theano backend with GPU computing. i found that broadcasting rules supported by numpy are not supported by keras. for example:
numpy supports: numpy.random.random(1,25,26)*numpy.random.random(3,25,26) ->output shape: (3,25,26)
but in keras custom layer, i can't do that in this structure:
input layer: shape ->(3,25,26)
custom layer: do elementwise multiplication : w×input where w's shape is (1,25,26)
can anyone knows is this a bug or limitation of keras theano backend?as i mentioned in #4454
many thanks!

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
