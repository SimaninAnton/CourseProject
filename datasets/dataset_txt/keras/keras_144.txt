I am trying to run the Siamese code on MNIST data.
The link of the code is : https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_siamese.py
In the code, I used my own training file and splitting the data into train and test as follows:
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(desc1, label1, test_size=0.5, random_state=1)
i.e. 50% into training and testing. When I am increasing the test_size from 0.5 to 1, the code is working. But if I reduced this value below 0.5, I am getting this error:
validation_data=([te_pairs[:, 0], te_pairs[:, 1]], te_y))
IndexError: too many indices for array
Please help.
