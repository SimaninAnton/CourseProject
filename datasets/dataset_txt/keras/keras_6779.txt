With the following code I see that it is quite easy to process two separate inputs of size (n,784) and (n,14) to an output of size (n,17+31)=(n,48):
left = Sequential()
left.add(Dense(784, 17))
left.add(Activation('relu'))
right= Sequential()
right.add(Dense(14, 31))
right.add(Activation('relu'))
model = Sequential()
model.add(Merge([left, right], mode='concat'))
but what about if we want to just pass in raw input for one of the merged models like:
left = Sequential()
left.add(Dense(784, 17))
left.add(Activation('relu'))
right= Sequential()
(something should go here?? or not??)
model = Sequential()
model.add(Merge([left, right], mode='concat'))
Should I put a right.add(Activation('linear')) there? I was under the impression that Activation('linear') mapped the previous input to the output. I tried it and it did not work however. What is the way we would pass the raw input in for one of the merged Sequentials? Thoughts?
By the way we would prefer not to use Graph, because we would like to just add some normal layers to model after the Merge layer.
Thank you!
