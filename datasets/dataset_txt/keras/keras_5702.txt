I am still confused about the difference between Dense and TimeDistributedDense even though there are already some similar questions asked here and here. People are discussing a lot but no common-agreed conclusions.
And even though, here, @fchollet stated that:
TimeDistributedDense applies a same Dense (fully-connected) operation to every timestep of a 3D tensor.
I still need detailed illustration about what exactly the difference between them.
