hi, when i write code like this
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_pred, y_true)

model.compile(loss=custom_loss,
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
i have got difference result with
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
I'm a little confused, How could this be??
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
