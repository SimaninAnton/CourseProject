Hello,
The TensorBoard calback does't seem to work with stateful LSTM.
Here's my model:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(7, return_sequences = True, stateful=True, batch_input_shape=(10, 10, 24), input_shape=(10, 24)))
....
tb = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=10, nb_epoch=nb_epoch, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), show_accuracy=True, callbacks=[tb])
When I train it, I get following error:
ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (300, 10, 24) for Tensor u'Placeholder_1:0', which has shape '(10, 10, 24)
BTW: (300, 10, 24) is the shape of the Test data.
When I remove the callback from model.fit() it doesn't give the error.
Is this a bug or am I overlooking something?
