I have some training data X_train in the shape (samples, features), where each sample represents features obtained from a different segment of a time series. These features are obtained from a previous CNN and Flatten stage. I want to reshape X_train into a new X_new array to be fed into a LSTM in the form (samples, time_steps, features) by taking overlapping windows of consecutive samples, so for example X_new[1] would have the features of X_train[0], X_train[1], and X_train[2] as time steps; X_new[2] would have the features of X_train[1], X_train[2], and X_train[3] as time steps, and so on.
My question is whether Keras has a built in function to do this, or if I would have to build a customized layer in order to do that. Thank you very much!
