I'm a rookie to coding and I noticed there is an interesting network architecture for semantic segmentation, which combine the U-net and Bidirectional convolutional LSTM, just like the image url below:

and here is the original paper
[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/4185279/]
I'm using the u-net code from [https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet], but have no idea how to combine BDCLSTM to it, can anyone offer some help? or is there existing code for this ?
