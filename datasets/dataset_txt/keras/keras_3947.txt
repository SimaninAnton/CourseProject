def create_base_network(input_dim):
'''Base network to be shared (eq. to feature extraction).
'''
seq = Sequential()
seq.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(input_dim,), activation='relu'))
seq.add(Dropout(0.1))
seq.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
seq.add(Dropout(0.1))
seq.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
return seq
This function is supposed to feature extraction.
After model.fit(), how can I get the output given input, e.g. x1 (one input of the Siamese network)
