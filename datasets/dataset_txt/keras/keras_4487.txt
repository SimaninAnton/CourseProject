How can I set the maximum norm for each weight on the convolution kernel?
I've tried to use the MaxNorm, but I don't know which axis should I specify. If I need to create my own Constraint, how should I code it? Something like the following code should work?:
'''
# Arguments
     m: the maximum norm for the incoming weights.
'''
def __call__(self, p):
        norms = K.sqrt(K.square(p))
        desired = K.clip(norms, 0, self.m)
        p = p * (desired / (K.epsilon() + norms))
return p
