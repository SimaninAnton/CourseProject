I just built a simple LSTM and am trying to save the weights so someone else can run the trained model. However on another computer when they load the weights they get this error.
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import LSTM
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Activation, Dropout 

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(40, input_shape=(40, 8), unroll=True, return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(2))
model.add(Activation("softmax"))

print(len(model.layers[0].get_weights()))
print(len(model.layers[2].get_weights()))
print(len(model.layers[4].get_weights()))
When we run the code above to check the dimension of the weight matrices, we get different answers:
The versions of Keras and Theano are the same. Is there any reason that when we build the same model that the weights would be stored differently?
