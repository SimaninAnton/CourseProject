I am implementing a model with triplet loss according to Recommendations in Keras using triplet loss.
I met some problems with Graph and my keras version is 1.0.1. So I went to the keras.io document.
However, Graph has been removed at version 1.0.3 and related documents have also been removed.
It seems that the framework is changed to functional API.
So why removed Graph? If I still want to use Graph, could I find the past keras.io document? Thanks!
