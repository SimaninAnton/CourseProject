Hi,
This stems from an old issue #3859, that was fixed by @kracwarlock but has still not being deployed for Keras 2.0 because there is a pending decision from @fchollet:.
do changes to the backend as was in the initial commits in the former PR
or
using the backend specific code solution he (@fchollet) suggested later and which he reviewed
THE PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Everytime clip_norm feature is used for an Embedding layer in a training with TensorFlow, this error shows up: unsupported operand type(s) for : 'IndexedSlices' and 'float'.
THE ENVIROMENT:
Keras 2.0
TensorFlow 1.0.0
Thanks a lot.
