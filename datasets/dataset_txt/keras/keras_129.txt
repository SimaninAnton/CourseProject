Please make sure that this is a Bug or a Feature Request and provide all applicable information asked by the template.
If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or on the Keras Slack channel instead of opening a GitHub issue.
System information
Keras 2.2.4
TensorFlow 1.14.0
Python 3.6
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with:
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
You can obtain the Keras version with:
python -c 'import keras as k; print(k.version)'
Describe the current behavior
import keras as k
# ---------------
ins = k.layers.Input(shape=(1,10,))
pre = k.layers.Input(shape=(1,10,))
feature_processed, cur_state = k.layers.SimpleRNN(10, return_state=True)(inputs=ins, initial_state=pre)
out = feature_processed
# ---------------
m = k.models.Model(inputs=[ins,pre], outputs=out)
m.compile(optimizer='SGD', loss='mean_squared_error')
# ---------------
res = m.predict(x=[np.concatenate((np.zeros((1,1,10)), np.ones((1,1,10)), np.zeros((1,1,10))), axis=0), np.zeros((3,1,10))])
res.shape
(3, 3, 10)
Describe the expected behavior
(3, 10)
or
(3, 1, 10)
