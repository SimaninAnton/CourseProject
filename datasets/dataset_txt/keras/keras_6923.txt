I believe it makes more sense when padding is set to "pre" that the beginning of the sequence is truncated when it's longer than maxlen. Right now as you reduce maxlen you cut padding characters off the beginning of the sequence until you hit the sequence length and then start cutting characters off the end of the sequence. I would think that this should at least be an option in pad_sequences. Thoughts?
