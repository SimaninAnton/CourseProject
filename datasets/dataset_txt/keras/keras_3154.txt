I am trying to implement a single input, multiple-output model using the functional API. I want to split the output of a convolutional layer over the channels and then work these outputs to different loss functions. I tried the following below; however, it did not work:
x = Convolution2D(3, 5, 5, border_mode='same')(x)
x0 = x[:, 0, :, :]  
x1 = x[:, 1, :, :]
x2 = x[:, 2, :, :]
I saw that the possibility of a Split layer has been discussed but I don't think it exists yet. Any suggestions on how I can achieve this splitting?
