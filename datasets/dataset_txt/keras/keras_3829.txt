For the example below, .summary() reports the same number of parameters for the first two calls. I believe the second and third calls should both report total params as 0.
vgg = keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16(include_top=False)
vgg.summary()  # First call, total params 14714688
vgg.trainable=False
vgg.summary()  # Second call,  total params 14714688
for k in vgg.layers:
     k.trainable=False
vgg.summary()  #third call, total params 0
