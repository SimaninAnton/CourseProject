I am building a multi-output model by using keras, and like to check the loss of each individual output.
But it seems the training returns only the mean value of losses. Is there any way that we can extract the losses of all outputs.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
