Hi, in the documentã€€about convolution layers, I find:
model.add(Convolution1D(64, 3, border_mode='same', input_shape=(10, 32)))
# now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 64)
So the number of filters (64) is the value of the second dimension of the output, excluding the number of samples (None)
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, border_mode='same', input_shape=(3, 256, 256)))
# now model.output_shape == (None, 64, 256, 256)
Now the number of filters (64) is the value of the first dimension of the output, excluding the number of samples(None) again.
Can anyone explain why? Many thanks.
