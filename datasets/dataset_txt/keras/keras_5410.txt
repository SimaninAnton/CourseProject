I would like to know why at the model's methods which use a generator, has the argument `nb_worker deprecated.
There is any way to do it now correctly to have multiple threads fetching for your data?
Because in my case I work with a dataset made up by videos, it has an increment of speed fetching the data in multiple threads rather in only one.
