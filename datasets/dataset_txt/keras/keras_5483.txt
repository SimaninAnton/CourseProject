When using stateful=True in a RNN layer, obviously the model needs a fixed batch size during training so the right sequences are continued over several batches, but why is it that a model.predict() call requires the same batch size? This seems like an unnecessary limitation. Is there a way to get around this without adding dummy sequences to the input?
