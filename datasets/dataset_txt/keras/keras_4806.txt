I am using LSTM for estimating the location of a target based on a sequence of sensor observations. My understanding of LSTM is that in addition to its capability for temporal patterns, it has similarity to Elman RNN in which the value of hidden nodes at current time is a nonlinear function of the values of hidden nodes and inputs of the model at previous time. Basically, the value of hidden nodes are fed back to the neurons.
My question is: is there any way that we can have a LSTM while values of output of the network are fed back to the neurons (The way that Jordan RNN works)?
If yes how I can implement it using Keras?
