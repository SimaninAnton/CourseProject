I was checking the "Multi-input and multi-output models" in https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/
and by executing the line
x = keras.layers.concatenate([lstm_out, auxiliary_input])
It gives me the error:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'concatenate'
I could not find why this does not work in Google.
Any suggestions?
Thank you
