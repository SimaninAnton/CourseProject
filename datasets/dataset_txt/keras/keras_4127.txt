When I run the keras test suite I get a bunch of errors (also without local modifications) in: test_image_classification, test_atrous_conv_2d, test_zero_padding_3d, test_atrous_conv_1d, test_TimeDistributed.
Anyone know anything about this? I can put the full error report if needed of course.
Another question I have is: does pytest test/ run tests with different backgrounds and versions of python, or should I run additional things to test if a modification did not break anything?
Appreciate your help!
