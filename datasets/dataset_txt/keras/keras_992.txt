Hi folks,
I'm wondering if there is an easy way to change the "loss_weights" for a network (with multiple outputs) after every iteration, when I can only use "train_on_batch" function. I've seen people suggestting to change the "loss_weights" through callbacks like in #2595 . But since I will use train_on_batch, I guess callbacks is no longer available (please correct me if I'm wrong).
Any idea will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
JC
