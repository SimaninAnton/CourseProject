I'm trying to run the following network with Keras, powered by a TensorFlow backend. It's an adaptation of the "VGG-like" convnet from http://keras.io/examples/. I've linked a very small sample of the data to this issue report, and created scripts on Gist that can be used to reproduce the error (https://gist.github.com/aaronpolhamus/39c7a71151b8560d02dd).
Basically I've adapted the website example to accept an array of greyscale, single-channel images. Seems pretty straightforward, but when I attempt to train the model after compiling it I'm seeing the following error:
ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (32, 128, 256) for Tensor u'Placeholder_89:0', which has shape '(?, 1, 128, 256)'
I'm puzzled: shouldn't it be no problem to generate 32 convolution filters with dim (32, 128, 256) from a series of input images with dimenstions (1, 128, 256)? It's likely that I'm still a novice with this stuff, but this error just isn't informative enough for me to tell what's going wrong or how to fix it...
Here's a link to sample data:

Thanks in advance!
