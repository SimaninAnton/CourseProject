Hello.
I try to make a model on a functional API with the participation of recursive layers.
>>> inputs = Input( shape=( 4, ) )
>>> x = Reshape( ( 1, 4 ) )(inputs)
>>> x = normalization.BatchNormalization( batch_input_shape=(None, 1, 4) )(x)
>>> x = GRU( gru1 )(x) #, input_shape=(data_x.shape[1], data_x.shape[2])
>>> predictions = Dense( 1, activation='tanh' )(x)
>>> model = Model( inputs=inputs, outputs=predictions )
..
    model = Model( inputs=inputs, outputs=predictions )
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'inputs'
As far as I understood the problem in the line:
inputs = Input( shape=( 4, ) )
Tell me how you can solve the problem.
Thank you.
