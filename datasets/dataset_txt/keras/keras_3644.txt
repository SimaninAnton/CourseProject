Hi ,
I am on a document classification problem, and I am trying to construct a model with Stacked LSTM's each for a sentence in the document. The output of all the LSTM's is merged and passed through a 'tanh' layer and serves as the Document representation.
The gist of the code and model summary :
https://gist.github.com/reachbp/6de81bee951d5aaa671428f34f4201bf
The model compiles file, but when I try to run a simple example I get the below error:
python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.pyc in _assert_fetchable(self, graph, op)
429 if not graph.is_fetchable(op):
430 raise ValueError(
--> 431 'Operation %r has been marked as not fetchable.' % op.name)
432
433 def fetches(self):
ValueError: Operation u'init_166' has been marked as not fetchable.
