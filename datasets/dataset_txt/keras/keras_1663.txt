Hi! Keras contains code for a Convolutional LSTM layer, called ConvLSTM2D. Nowhere in Keras' documentation at http://keras.io is this layer mentioned. Looking at its source code, it is mentioned
The current implementation does not include the feedback loop on the cells output
But I am not sure what that means.
Basically what I am wondering is:
Is ConvLSTM2D currently a tested, confirmed working implementation of a convolutional LSTM?
Are there any major differences between this implementation and the reference paper, and if so, what practical effect will that have?
Why is it not documented?
I've done some basic tests where I've used it on some sequences of images, and it seems somewhat able to learn temporal aspects, so that's promising.
