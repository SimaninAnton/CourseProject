I was trying to implement a Siamese Network with Keras followed by the mnist_siamese_graph example. After training, each sample in X1 is assumed similar to sample in X2.
For example: X1[0] is similar to X2[0]. On the contrary, x1[0] is not as similar as x1[n] if they have different labels.
However, after training, t1[0] was very similar to t1[1], but also is similar to t1[n].
Anyone has experience on that?
