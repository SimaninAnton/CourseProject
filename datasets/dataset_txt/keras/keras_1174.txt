Let's say I have a dataset of shape (30, 2), which means I have 30 samples, and 2 features, which are sales and promotion. I want to build a model to perform 1 day ahead forecasting of sales, based on sales of the last 5 days and promotion of the last 5 days and the current day. By doing some shifting and removing NA's, I could get a new dataframe with 25 rows, and 12 features, which are, promotion(t-5), sales(t-5), promotion(t-4), sales(t-4), ... , promotion(t-1), sales(t-1), promotion(t), sales(t). The last column will be treated as response y, and the first 11 columns will be treated as X, the question is how to shape X, should I add a new column with constant and shape it into (25, 6, 2)? the promotion(t) column has to be included in X
