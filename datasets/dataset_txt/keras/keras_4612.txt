hey Keras-Folks,
I have a small Sequential net to train, and would like to use fit_generator with a datagen i wrote myself.
If i now use this datagen on my fit_generator, i recognize a additional python process starting in my system-monitor-process list. Thats fine for now, since i think it is the asynchron queue-generating datagenerator.
but after the script ends, this process does not get killed. Specifically, i invoke my fit script from another python script to test over some hyperparameters in a loop. And after every iteration i have one python process more in the process-list.. occupying around 1.5GiB RAM. each.
so how do i correctly close/delete this datagen-process after i dont need it anymore?
thanks in advance
