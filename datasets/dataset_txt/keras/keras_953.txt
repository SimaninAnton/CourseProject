My GPU only supports CUDA 8 (Nvidia GeForce 940M)
CUDA 8 needs CUDNN 7 and tensorflow 1.4.1
Tensorflow 1.4.1 does not support the softmax function.
Is there a workaround or maybe an alternative I can use to the softmax function, because there seems to be no other solution (except for getting a new GPU which supports CUDA 9)
