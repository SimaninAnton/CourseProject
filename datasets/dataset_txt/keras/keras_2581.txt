In the Paper End-to-End Memory Network(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08895.pdf) for computing Multiple Hops we use the following formula:
Uk+1 = Uk + Ok ---- (1)
Where as in the code for memnn has dimension of O has a dimension of (query_maxlen, story_maxlen) where as U has a dimension of
(query_maxlen, embedding_dim), which is not same. Using which we can add them according Equation 1. Are we missing something or making a mistake in code?
