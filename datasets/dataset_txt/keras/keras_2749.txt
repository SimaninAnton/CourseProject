Guys I've seen the #81 issue and as I understand you remember mean and variance during training time (when train=True), and at the test time you use previously remembered mean and variance (on the last step), But when I looked inside the code I saw something weird.
When train=False, it returns just normed, which is calculated for the inputs' batch, and only after that if (inside the else block) it calls K.batch_normalization(...) which uses T.nnet.bn.batch_normalization_test(...).Could you explain me please where you put remembered mean and variance over the last step's set?
