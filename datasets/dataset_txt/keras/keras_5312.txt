Hi.
I want to predict the next time-step feature vector from a sequence of feature vectors.
For example, I have a time sequence [X1,X2,...,Xn], and each of the sequence is a feature vector. And I want to predict next feature vector Xn+1.
The loss function is cosine similarity.
I have try to use
model.add(Activation('linear')) model.compile(loss='cosine_proximity',optimizer='rmsprop')
However, it didn't work. How can I fix it?
Thanks.
