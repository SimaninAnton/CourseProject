I installed keras in anaconda,when I setted the keras.json,I couldn't find the file in keras/, so I created the file named keras.json and writed the code in the file:
{

"image_dim_ordering":"th",

"epsilon":1e-07,

"floatx":"float32",

"backend":"theano"

}
after saved the file, the keras backend is still tensorflow!
