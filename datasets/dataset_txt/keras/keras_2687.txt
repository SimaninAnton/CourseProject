In my main.py file, I save weights using model.to_yaml() and writing a config.yaml file to disk. I also save teh weights at the end of training as an 'h5' file.
When I want to load the config, I open the yaml file, and call read() on it. Then I pass this read object into model_from_yaml but get the following error:
raise ValueError('Missing layer: ' + inbound_layer_name) ValueError: Missing layer: context_input
context_input is the name of my input layer.
I am using Keras 2.0.1. What could be the issue? I've tried many different things (model.save, json config, etc.)
