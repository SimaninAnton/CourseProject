In the following line of code:
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
I'm getting this error:
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'rescale'
Provided that I'm using Keras v.1.0.3 with a Tensorflow backend. I'm using TensorFlow v.1.0.0.
Using the latest version of Keras will cause me the issue below, which is why I'm avoiding using the latest version:
KeyError: "Can't open attribute (Can't locate attribute: 'nb_layers')"
The latter issue seems to be related to this code snippet:
# load VGG16 weights
    f = h5py.File(weights_path)

    for k in range(f.attrs['nb_layers']):
        if k >= len(model.layers):
            break
        g = f['layer_{}'.format(k)]
        weights = [g['param_{}'.format(p)] for p in range(g.attrs['nb_params'])]
        model.layers[k].set_weights(weights)

    f.close()
    print('Model loaded.')
How can I solve this rescale issue, or even the latter issue if that would work?
Thanks.
