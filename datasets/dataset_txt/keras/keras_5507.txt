I was looking for the LambdaMerge source when I realized that the [source] links on the keras.io documentation page link to incorrect line numbers.
For example:
Dense Layer links to: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L947
But the Dense class is defined at line number 507.
Also, where is the source for the LambdaMerge layer? I couldn't find it at /keras/layers/core.py
