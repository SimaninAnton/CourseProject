I trained as LSTM model and save it with to_json() and save_weights(), however when i tried to load the model it came with this error:
Exception: If a RNN is stateful, a complete input_shape must be provided (including batch size).
i followed the code and found it was the wrong input_shape with none values, but how could i define it while load a model?
here follows the error logs and my load codes
