Now I'm working on two machines; one iMac and the other on linux server.
iMac: MacOsX, python 2.7.6. theano 0.7.0, keras installed with sudo pip.
server: python 2.7.10 Anaconda, theano 0.6.0, keras was cloned with local folder with sys.path.append(''), then I tested after install it by python setup.py install --user.
Symptoms: keras throws an error for my code, cifar10_cnn and mnist_cnn examples while all of them works well on my iMac.

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'signal'
The messages are the same for all three codes.
It could be problem on the way I installed keras, theano version, or even python version, or something else that I can't imagine. Sadly I'm not allowed to use sudo on the server, now I'm going to try on virtualenv. I'd appreciate any comments!
