TensorBoard relies on all operators having proper names to group them, and I think any other visualisation tools that seek to examine the graphs would probably want a hierarchical grouping of operators too.
However, it seems like Keras only really names weights and not operators. Naming everything individually is probably a painful process, particularly since extra operations are generated in places which don't necessarily have the context to name things properly.
Rather than trying the herculean task of piping names through everywhere, I would suggest copying the TF idea of name scopes and then adding them to things like layers to start with.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
