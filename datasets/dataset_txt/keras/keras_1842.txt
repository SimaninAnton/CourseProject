I have a LSTM task, input data is inertial sensor and gyroscope measurements, 6D. Output is relative displacement 7D (3D pos, 4D angular).
Now I use 70% data for training, and training sequence is 200, batch size is 1, and set the LSTM to be stateful because I want it to remember the states from the last sequence. I write a customized loss function, owing to the fact the last 4D of output should always have norm 1 (Quaternion angle representation, not important to this question)
After every epoch, I want to measure the loss with validation data set, that is a single very long sequence, can I do it like this? Validation and training sequence have different lengths.
But I got error like this
InvalidArgumentError: Shape [-1,-1,6] has negative dimensions
I attached detailed Python notebook as followed:

Another question is:
I write a metric function return a vector 7D, but in the logs seems only the first value is returned. Any idead?
Thanks in advance!
