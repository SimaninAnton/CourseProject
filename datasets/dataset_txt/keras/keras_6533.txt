With the latest updates to scan in Theano, anybody else experiencing dramatically different training times? In particular, LSTM is faster, but GRU/JZS1-3 is much, much slower:
A relative comparison on a test network, exchanging the recurrent layer:
LSTM: 15s
GRU: 94s
JZS1: 63s
JZS2: 83s
JZS3: 91s
For this same network, LSTM pre Theano scan changes was ~24s.
Anybody have some insight into this?
