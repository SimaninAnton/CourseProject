Hi
The recurrent layer documentation for the consume_less argument says that, when the value of consume_less is 'gpu', "RNN dropout must be shared for all gates, resulting in a slightly reduced regularization." Does this mean that only one of dropout_U or dropout_W is used. If so, which one?
Thanks
