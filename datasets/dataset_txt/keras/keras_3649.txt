Hey all,
This is my first PR attempt to Keras so I hope I am doing this right (aka following opening an issue before a PR).
I extended ImageDataGenerator to include a variable roration_step that lets you set discrete steps of angles here is the code.
I ran local tests here and it seems to work, but I didn't run the testing environment, I am not sure how to do that exactly.
Also this might be relevant to #3338
What else should I do to get this in? or get it to the right place to extending supports this?
Thanks!
