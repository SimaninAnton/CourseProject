I am doing a project to run keras model on Android. When I convert the keras model to pb file using
freeze_graph. There is an error that :
assert d in name_to_node, "%s is not in graph" % d
AssertionError: output/Linear_ is not in graph.
But the jason file displays that the name of last layer is "output", and the activation function is "linear".
However, when I set another layer as the output node with the activation function of "relu". The model is converted successfully.
How to solve this problem.
Thanks.
