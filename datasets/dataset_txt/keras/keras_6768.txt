Usage of constraints
Functions from the constraints module allow setting constraints (eg. non-negativity) on network parameters during optimization.
The penalties are applied on a per-layer basis. The exact API will depend on the layer, but the layers Dense, TimeDistributedDense, MaxoutDense, Convolution1D and Convolution2D have a unified API.
-----why say 'The penalties are applied on a per-layer basis. ' here?
