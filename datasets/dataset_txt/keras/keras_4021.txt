I have been working on character based text generation. It seems that the way this is done in all Keras examples is to break the text up into semi redundant sequences of text based on paramaters 'maxlen' and 'step'.
So if I was training on the alphabet with maxlen 5 and step 3, my Data would look something like
X={abcde, defgh, ghijk, etc}
y={f,i,l, etc}
My understanding of how LSTMs and RNN in general train was that the data is something more like
X={a,b,c,d,e,f, etc}
y={b,c,d,e,f,g, etc}
Where the characters in X would be input, and the output compared to the desired output y at each step.
In training does Keras break apart the maxlen sequences to be character by character?
If so does it only compare to the chosen class maxlen characters?
Why is it done this way?
I've realized this may not be the best place for this type of question. Should I mark this closed/delete it?
