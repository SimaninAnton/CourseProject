I'm trying to train a model using a big data set, but since it's an autoencoder, I have to pass the same training set twice, both as "X_train" and "y_train":
model2.fit(X_train, X_train, nb_epoch=16);
But this is a huge waste of memory and the machine can't handle it. Is there a way to pass them to the function "as reference"? Or maybe some other workaround?
Thanks
