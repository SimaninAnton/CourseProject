I get a memory error while using ImageDataGenerator.fit(X) since X is large.
x = np.copy(x) is causing the memory error since it is a heavy operation.

x = np.copy(x) seems unnecessary here if augment is False and
self.featurewise_center
self.featurewise_std_normalization
self.zca_whitening
are all False
