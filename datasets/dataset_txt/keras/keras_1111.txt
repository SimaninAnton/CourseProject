my computer get two gpus，it' s normal if i don't add this code in the context.
model = keras.utils.training_utils.multi_gpu_model(base_model, gpus=2)
however, it will use only one to compute, i don't understand what's it means 'work_element_count > 0'. is it that i have not cleared the cuda worker before ?
