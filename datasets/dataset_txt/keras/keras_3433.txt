Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hello, I am trying to create a Variational Autoencoder to work on images. The example on the repository shows an image as a one dimensional array, how can I modify the example to work, for instance, for images of shape =(none,3,64,64). I've tried to do so, without success, particularly on the Lambda layer:
def sampling(args):
    z_mean, z_log_var = args
    epsilon = K.random_normal(shape=(batch_size, 3,64,64)), mean=0.,
                              std=epsilon_std)
    return z_mean + K.exp(z_log_var / 2) * epsilon

z = Lambda(sampling, output_shape=(latent_dim,))([z_mean, z_log_var])
What must be the output_shapeof the Lambda layer?
Thanks guys
