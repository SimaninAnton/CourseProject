I stumbled over a strange line of code in keras/engine/training.py:2357 which doesn't make sense to me:
return [out for out in all_outs]
Is there a deeper sense to this that I don't understand, or should it really rather be this?
return [out[0] for out in all_outs]
Otherwise it seems to return [ [ nd.array(...) ] ] when running a model with multiple outputs for only one step. This seems inconsistent with the other 3 return statements in that method.
