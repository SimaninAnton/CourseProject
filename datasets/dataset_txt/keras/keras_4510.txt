Hi,
I am not conformable with h5py, and I would like to use vgg16_weights.h5
In my code, I use weights_path = 'vgg16_weights.h5' and f = h5py.File(weights_path) in my script using notepad++, but it does not work.
However, when I use the two code above in my python environmentï¼Œ it can work. So how can I use h5py in my script?
Thank you
