Hi, everyone!
I want to add a Dense layer after LSTM, it looks like this:
    Out_t              Out_t+1
     ↑                   ↑
  Dense(n)       →     Dense(n)  ...
     ↑                   ↑
   LSTM                 LSTM  
     ↑                    ↑
  Out_t-1               Out_t  
that means for every single step this Dense layer will get output, and I want it as input to the next step.
BTW, the Out_t will connect to hardware, so the program will wait the new input until the operation finished.
