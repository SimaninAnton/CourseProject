Hi all, this is a feature request.
Since keras objects are not pickeable and I want to save different callbacks configurations, I would like to use a method like the get_config method that optimizers have for example.
In this sens I could do
callback_params = somecallback.get_config()
and then save these parameters.
I don't know why this method isn't a default method.
I would be more than happy to contribute to this issue if you find it useful.
