Hi,
I have just learned the examples in http://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
I am wondering that is training a classifier using CNN Features same as training from scratch and what is the difference among fine-tuning, training with the extracted "fc" features and training from scratch?
