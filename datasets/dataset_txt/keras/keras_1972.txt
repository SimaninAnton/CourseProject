Hi,
I am new to Keras and trying to implement a custom objective function as described in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04898 (Page 2, Equation 2). For the second part of the equation 2, I need access to the original training sample that is correspondent to y_true and also the index of it. Is it possible to access it in Keras.
Thanks
