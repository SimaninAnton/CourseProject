I have an issue with results in examples/image_ocr.py script.
Sample works perfect when I predict data of size equal to minibatch_size (32) or greater.
But if I run prediction of any small size data, e.g. 1, 2, or 3 images, I got absolutely strange and incorrect answers, like random.
Predicting 10-20 samples sometimes look good but with 20-30% errors.
Is it GRU's feature or bug? Or something else?
GRU layers in the example are not stateful and shouldn't depend on minibatch size.
