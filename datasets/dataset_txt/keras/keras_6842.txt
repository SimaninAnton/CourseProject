What would be the simplest method to perform back propagation on the top n layers? I want to be able to stop learning at the bottom layers for a while. This can be done either by setting a small learning curve on these layers or back propagating only on the top layers. I'm new to Keras/Theano so any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks
