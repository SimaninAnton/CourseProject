I have used keras + tensorflow-gpu in my old computer, it's very ok. (I forget the tensorflow version)
I install keras with tensorflow-gpu (version 1.0.1) in my new computer, and before install keras, tensorflow can find my GPU. But after install keras, tensorflow only can find CPU.
(use $ pip3 install keras)
I use these code to check GPU:
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
device_lib.list_local_devices() 
$ nvidia-smi
And I tried to install keras from source ($ python setup.py install), it would have some error and install fail.
...
Installed /home/thisray/keras-test/lib/python3.5/site-packages/Keras-2.0.0-py3.5.egg
Processing dependencies for Keras==2.0.0
Searching for tensorflow
Reading https://pypi.python.org/simple/tensorflow/
No local packages or working download links found for tensorflow
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('tensorflow')
Is this problem about version ?
thanks
