For identity connection of Residual networks in Keras, I was using this class.
class Identity(Layer):
    def get_output(self, train):
        return self.get_input(train)
I checked out porting guide, which says get_output should be replaced with call. But I'm not sure what would be equivalent to self.get_input(train).
