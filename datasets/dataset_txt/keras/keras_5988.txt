Hi team, great job with Keras.
On http://keras.io/examples/
It appears (to me) as if the examples are missing the .core and .convolutional in the "from" portion of the import
--current
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten
from keras.layers import Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D
--should be
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten
from keras.layers.convolutional import Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D
Perhaps I've been screwing something up.
Thanks,
Ben
