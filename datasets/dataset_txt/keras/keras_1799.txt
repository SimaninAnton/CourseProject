This is a little basic question, but I couldn't find anything under the documentation, nor in the examples.
My question is how does following statement get interpreted in Keras?
for numnodes in [10,20,30]:
MyLayer1=Dense(numnodes)(MyLayer1)
Is there a way I can freeze this layer from the Model level? I notice that I can run model.get_layer('freezeThis').trainable=False if I have
MyLayer1=Dense(10,name="freezeThis")(prev_layers)
for numnodes in [10,20,30]:
MyLayer1=Dense(numnodes)(MyLayer1)
I get error keras all layer names should be unique if I do
MyLayer1=Dense(10)(prev_layers)
for numnodes in [10,20,30]:
MyLayer1=Dense(numnodes,name="freezeThis")(MyLayer1)
Reason why I wondered about this question. Kindly reply!
(Note: This is a reduced/simplified query. In the actual script, I have GRU, autoencoder, CNN and what not! Possible that I might have misunderstood something else. Is this a safe way to freeze the layers?)
UPDATE: Currently failing for the other alternative too. It cannot find the layer, debugging it, kindly ignore question for now..
