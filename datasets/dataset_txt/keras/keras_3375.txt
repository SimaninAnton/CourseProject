tensorflow/tensorflow#4072
For now, for pure FCN, using tensorflow is relatively slower than theano, about 2x-3x.
In the above issue it said that we could use tf.while_loop and XLA, can we integrate it in keras? Detect if the tf backend version support xla(after 1.0alpha), if so then use the optimization.
