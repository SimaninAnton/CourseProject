Hey everyone!
I'm trying to use a LSTM with data in the shape something like [300, 1, x] where x changes. As of right now I'm training the model where x = 300 but after training the model I'm trying to go back through and make predictions on data in the shape [300, 1, 270] for an example. I've been exploring this and it seems like it can be done with the Theano backend (see #2054) but in my code when I use the following model:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=None))
model.add(Dense(1))
I get the error 'TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable'. Anyone know what's going on? According to the issue I linked that should work fine unless I'm misinterpreting it (is it only the 1st dimension that can be None?).
Info:
Python v3.5.3
Keras v2.0.2
Theano v0.9.0
Thanks!
