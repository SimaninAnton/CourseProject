How do i prepare the data if i want to use my own data in siamese net example? Let's say that my data have 4 classes/labels, should i just change all "10" into "4"? Like all of them? Or i only need to change the code in a certain part? I'm currently getting 0.50000 for the accuracy all the time, i assume it might be something to do with the pair/data preparation. Thanks in advance
