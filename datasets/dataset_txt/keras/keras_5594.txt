I want some clarification on Image Captioning problem example.
What is partial caption?
Is it one hot encoding of text data with sequence padding of fixed length
What is next words?
I am unable to understand it from comments
and for test image do we need partial captions and if yes then how to generate partial captions for test images.
If anybody has working model of same with flickr8k dataset then please guide me.
I am planing to use flickr8k dataset.
Thanks In advance
