Hi all,
Just like the problem here, but things are a little different.
#848
x_train = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,4,3,4,5]]
y_train = [[[1],[2],[2],[1],[1],[1],[2],[3]],[[1],[2],[1],[2],[3]]]
What should I do to build this network?
What should I do if I want to control the window size of each label?( like #1029 comment by joetigger)
Thank you
