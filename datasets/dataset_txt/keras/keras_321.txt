This issue is identical to the #9642.
The documentation doesn't include dilation_rate for depthwise convolutions because it was not included as one of the keyword arguments. Instead dilation_rate is passed to _Conv() through **kwargs. Need to add dilation_rate explicitly to the keyword arguments.
The fix should be pretty straightforward, like #9844.
