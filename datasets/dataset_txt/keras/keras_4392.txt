Given the impressive results of DeepMind's WaveNet using dilated convolutions, it would make sense to also make it available in Keras. However, although there is layer for 2D convolutions (AtrousConvolution2D), there isn't one for 1D. Theoretically you could implement this with the 2D class by having "image" dimensions of Nx1, but it would look confusing and doesn't make sense given that there are 1D layers available as well.
Would it make sense to include this as one of Keras' available convolutional layers?
Alternatively, would it make better sense to just drop the AtrousConvolution layers altogether and implement this as an additional parameter on the base convolution layers? Dilations are already a parameter in the conv2d backend function anyway.
