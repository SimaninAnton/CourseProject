I am using Keras with tensorflow for creating LSTM models. The model is a single layer with 16 cells.
model.trainable_weights
[<tf.Variable 'lstm_1/kernel:0' shape=(6, 64) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'lstm_1/recurrent_kernel:0' shape=(16, 64) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'lstm_1/bias:0' shape=(64,) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'dense_1/kernel:0' shape=(16, 6) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'dense_1/bias:0' shape=(6,) dtype=float32_ref>]
gives this output. From here, I am unable to determine what are the input weights, cell weights, forget and output gate weights. How can we determine that
And
model.layers[0].states generates ouput:
[<tf.Variable 'lstm_1/Variable:0' shape=(40, 16) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'lstm_1/Variable_1:0' shape=(40, 16) dtype=float32_ref>]
here 40 is the batch size. What are these two states. Is it the cell state? Then how two?
