Hello everyone!
Could anyone tell me, please, whether a built-in leave-one-out validation exists in Keras? I mean, let's assume I have only a training data set consisting of 100 records and want to build the model 100 times based on 99 records and validating it on the remaining one. Would like to avoid implementing this on my own with loops, if possible. :)
Of course, during this process I'd like to accumulate the error of predictions (basically, my target variable is continuous, so speeking here about a regression task) from model to model.
Thank you very much 4 your responses in advance!
Almost forgot: Happy New Year! :)
