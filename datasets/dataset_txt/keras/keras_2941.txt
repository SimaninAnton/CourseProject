This is rather a general question. Just for the sake of simplicity and not re-inventing the wheel, is there a good way of refer another layer in a layer?
Say I have more than one tensor to compute in call function, and I want to deploy BatchNormalization to both of them, this means I need a in-built batch normalization in there.
I sort of come out one ugly solution where I simply replicated the entire BatchNormalization layer and made some tricks so it appears to be working.
