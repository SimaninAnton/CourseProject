Hello,
I am trying to train AI on different ResNet models. But, at each time, I have the following issue :
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'image_data_format'.
I am loading the ResNet models with the following code :
from keras_applications.resnet import ResNet50
from keras_applications.resnet import ResNet101
from keras_applications.resnet import ResNet152
For example, the code line I am using to build the model is :
model = ResNet50(input_shape= (IMG_SIZE_H, IMG_SIZE_W, NB_CHANNEL), include_top=True, weights=None, input_tensor=None, pooling=None, classes= NB_CLASSES)
My input shape is X_train shape: (415480, 50, 50, 1) with the parameter 'channels_last' applied by K.set_image_data_format('channels_last').
I am using the last version of Keras.
Could you help me please.
Thank you in advance
