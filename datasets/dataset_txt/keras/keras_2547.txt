Hello,
So I have been using theano till recently for my backend. During the merge operations when I would use concat the dimensions on one axis would double. Eg is my two tensors were 50x50 and 50x50 the resultant merged tensor would be 50x100,
However now that I am using tensorflow, on combining two tensors 50x50 and 50x50 using concat the output tensor is 50x50.
Is that normal? Or is there a bug in my code somewhere while using tensorflow.
Thank you!
