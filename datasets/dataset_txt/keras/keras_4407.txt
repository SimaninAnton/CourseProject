Hi,
Sorry if this is a simple question as I am new to Keras. I have seen a couple of examples where people were using the function Layer in keras.layers.core. But, I could not find a documentation about it. Can someone explain me what is Layer used for? And is it different from keras.layers.core.Dense?
