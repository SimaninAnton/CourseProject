CNN receives images as input and give us corresponding output vectors/labels at last layer. Error is usually computed using directly these output vectors/labels, but now I need to extract information from original input image in the last layer using the output vector and then compute error. How can I take the original input image and the output vector together in the last layer each iteration? Simple schema is "drawn" bellow.
Image_i ==> Conv./Activ. Layer ==> Conv./Activ. Layer ==> Dense/Activ. Layer ==> output_vector_i
........\===========================================================> image_i
