While building the keras documentation locally as described in /docs, I have encountered following error:
'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x96 in position 8197: invalid start byte
Turned out that in file ./sources/layers/recurrent.md there is a strange sing "-" on the line 187 (the "Encoder-Decoder" part):
[On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-4012).
After changing this "-", the install finished successfully.
My system: Win10, Python 3.5.0 (64 bit)
