I ran into this issue when using batch normalization in a sub-model applied to a time distributed layer:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'input_3' with dtype float
[[Node: input_3 = Placeholderdtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]]
Attached is a minimal example demonstrating the problem (the first comment on the gist has the error logs):
