Hey everyone. I'm thinking about making a visualization tool that is native to Keras and will work with both backends. Right now the plan is to wrap a Bokeh server. Some principles I'm thinking of:
Customization: Give users access to everything they would have access to in Bokeh
Simplicity: In terms of integrating with Keras, I would say add two extra arguments to the model.fit method: something like "visualization" (boolean) and "visualization_config" (dict) (better names?) If visualization is on, default visualization settings would be used unless they provided a visualization_config.
Flexibility: I'd like to make the server able to deploy on localhost or connect to a remote server. There are numerous use cases for a remote server.
Anyone else have something to add to the discussion? Pros? Cons?
