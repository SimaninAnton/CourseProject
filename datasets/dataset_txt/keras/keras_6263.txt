Hi,
I'm trying to understand how the embedding layer in keras works. I assume that this performs word encodings, but I'm interested in how it is done. I have read the code, but it seems to use some gather function from theano which I cannot seem to find. Would someone be able to give me a better definition of what's going on? Thanks a bunch!
