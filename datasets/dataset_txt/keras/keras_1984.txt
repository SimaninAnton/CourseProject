Hi,
So I just setup keras with the new CNTK backend. It seems to work much better in all my uses so far, but...
The deep dream example doesn't work for me.
It's running on GPU with tensorflow backend perfectly fine, but when I try to use CNTK, it spits out this:
Using CNTK backend
Selected GPU[0] GeForce GTX 1070 as the process wide default device.
Model loaded.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "deep_dream.py", line 89, in
scaling = K.prod(K.cast(K.shape(x), 'float32'))
File "C:\Users\Jesse\Anaconda3\envs\tensorflow_gpu\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\cntk_backend.py", line 570, in prod
axis = _normalize_axis(axis, x)
File "C:\Users\Jesse\Anaconda3\envs\tensorflow_gpu\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\cntk_backend.py", line 650, in _normalize_axis
shape = int_shape(x)
File "C:\Users\Jesse\Anaconda3\envs\tensorflow_gpu\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\cntk_backend.py", line 286, in int_shape
shape = x.shape
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'
Keep in mind that my CNTK install has been tested and works fine, as does my Tensorflow-gpu install, in all other instances I've tried so far.
Thoughts?
I am new, so I may be doing something wrong.
