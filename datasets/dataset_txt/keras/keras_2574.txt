The trainable properties is not clear currently.
There are two properties related to trainable:
trainable_weight which is a accumulation of the trainable weights in each layer so it depends on the current trainable property of each layer
_collected_trainable_weights which is the property which is used in fact during the update. It is decided during compilation
So in fact Keras supports sharing layers with different trainable property in different models. But somehow this two concept is quite confused.
Also I noticed that in the model summary trainable_weight is used which is not correct.
