Hi all,
I wish to train a stacked auto-encoder, but the input vectors** are binary, ie [0,0,1,1,0,1..1], and they are quite sparse......**
so picking the loss function as mse doesnt work so well, I wish to know
will it makes sense changing the last layer of decoder into a **softmax activation **
which loss function should I use.
Thanks
