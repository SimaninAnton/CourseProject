The efficacy of many machine learning problems depend on a metric which can only be evaluated on the entire validation set. A popular example of such a metric is ROC AUC. This metric is nonlinear and thus cannot be computed batch-wise.
A possible concept of operations is to have a callback invoked at the end of validation with passed parameters y_true and y_pred so that such metrics could be evaluated. The downside of such a function is that y_true and y_pred could be rather large in memory (e.g. y_true is an image). However, for many problems such as categorical classification, y_true and y_pred will be N < 1e6.
