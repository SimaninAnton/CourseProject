Hello
I have implemented a variational autoencoder with CNN layers in the encoder and decoder. The code is shown below. My training data (train_X) consists of 40'000 images with size 64 x 80 x 1 and my validation data (valid_X) consists of 4500 images of size 64 x 80 x 1.
I would like to adapt my network in the following two ways:
Instead of using 2D convolutions (Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose) I would like to use 3D convolutions to take time into account (as the third dimension). For that I would like to use slices of 10 images, i.e. I will have images of size 64 x 80 x 1 x 10. Can I just use Conv3D and Conv3DTranspose or are other changes necessary?
I would like to try out convolutional LSTMs (ConvLSTM2D) in the encoder and decoder instead of plain 2D convolutions. Again, the input size of the images would be 64 x 80 x 1 x 10 (i.e. time series of 10 images). How can I adapt my network to work with ConvLSTM2D?
