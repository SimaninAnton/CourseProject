Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
dtype error will occure when add a Conv2D layer, with floatx='float64' in keras.json
Code causes error:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D
model=Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(9,9), padding='valid',input_shape=(33,33,1),activation='relu'))
