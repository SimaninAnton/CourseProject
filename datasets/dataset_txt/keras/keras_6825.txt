Has anyone tried running Keras at a larger scale, such as on a cluster or in an HPC environment? I have access to such an environment and would be interested to understand whether Keras can be used effectively in such an environment? Perhaps it would require using intermediate outputs stored on disk such as with joblib to break up the processing?
