I have a tensor, A, with a shape (sample, time, dim) and a tensor, B, with a shape (dim,). I would like to compute the dot product along the last dimension of A and broadcasted such that the output tensor, C, is of the shape (sample, time).
(sample,time,dim) + (dim,) -> (sample,time)
The tensor B is a 1-d tensor of trainable weights, if this somehow changes the approach to this problem.
Is there a canonical way to broadcast the dot product?
