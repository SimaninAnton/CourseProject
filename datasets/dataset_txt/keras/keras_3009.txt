I have Keras installed with both Tensorflow and Theanon. I found that, when using Tensorflow as backend, the GPU mode can be launched; while using Theano as backend, the GPU mode is not launched. What are the possible reasons for this? Which kind of configuration should I modified/examined for this kind of problem? Thanks.
