I am not very clear about the timesteps in the input of RNN and LSTM. In my understanding, if we set timesteps as K, Keras will look back for K steps (So, the RNN or LSTM will be unrolled for K times) and make the prediction. Is it correct?
Also, How does LSTM in Keras unroll itself? Which parameter decides the length of TruncatedBPTT? Thanks
