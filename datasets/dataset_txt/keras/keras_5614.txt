The Optimizer's class get_config method returns a dictionary with single key "name". However, Optimizer can also receive "clipnorm" and "clipvalue" keyword arguments. It would be nice to also add them to the dictionary returned by get_config if they were set.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I'd be happy to implement this feature.
