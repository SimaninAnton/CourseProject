I have a situation where I want to pass 1-hot vectors as input and then embed it into lower dimension.
For example, I have single feature input vector like this:
a =
[0,
1,
0,
2,
3,
3,
]
As one can see, there are three classes and 6 samples, hence it's one-hot encoding will be:
b =
[1 0 0 0,
0 1 0 0,
1 0 0 0,
0 0 1 0,
0 0 0 1,
0 0 0 1
]
I want to pass b as input to the model and then embed it using an embedding layer.
Current embedding seems to only support sequence of categorical values as input and not the one-hot vectors.
In fact, I am able to successfully pass a and get an embedding with something like below:
a =  Input(shape=(1,), dtype='int32', name = 'input1')
em = Embedding(output_dim=3,input_dim=4,input_length=1) (a)
But I cannot see how can I modify this to pass b as input instead of a.
Please let me know if there is any way to work around this.
Thanks
