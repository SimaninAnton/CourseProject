Hi,
Forgive me if this issue has already been dealt with or there exists a discussion somewhere else. I was wondering if Keras has the functionality like Caffe to save the full training state along with the model parameters i.e. momentum vector + model params while saving the model/solverstate. I am asking it because re-training from a certain point in training iterations does require the momentum vector otherwise, in general, deep models go wacky.
Thanks
