I am running a deep net model on Keras code. The training model was running perfectly fne on image size 76_76, but it not working on image dimension 128_128.
I got the below error :
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/theano/tensor/opt.py", line 4262, in get_num_denum
pairs = [self.get_num_denum(input2) for input2 in parent.inputs]
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
if isinstance(c, graph.Constant) and (len(c.clients) <= 1):
RuntimeError: ('maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object', 'Please, report this to theano-dev mailing list. As a temporary work around, you can raise Python stack limit with: import sys; sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)')
I am using a GPU machine (NVIDIA GF110GL [Tesla M2075]) with fairly good configuration. I don't want to proceed with temporary work-around because in that case, the code is getting stuck before training. Kindly suggest some better way to handle this issue.
