As always, I prefer stackoverflow for such issues (see my question) but here we go:
I want to take an input image img (which also has negative values) and feed it into two activation layers. However, I want to make a simple transformation e.g. multiply the whole image with -1.0:
left = Activation('relu')(img)
right = Activation('relu')(tf.mul(img, -1.0))
If I do it this way I am getting:
TypeError: Output tensors to a Model must be Keras tensors. Found: Tensor("add_1:0", shape=(?, 5, 1, 3), dtype=float32)
and I am not sure how I can fix that. Is there a Keras side mul() method that I can use for such a thing? Or can I wrap the result of tf.mul(img, -1.0) somehow such that I can pass it on to Activation?
Please note: The negative values may be important. Thus transforming the image s.t. the minimum is simply 0.0 is not a solution here.
I am getting the same error for
left = Activation('relu')(conv)
right = Activation('relu')(-conv)
