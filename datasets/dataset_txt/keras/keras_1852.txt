Hello,
I am trying to save a sequential model, but the console is returning "module 'h5py' has no attribute 'File'"
from keras.models import load_model, Sequential

model = Sequential()
model.save('my_model.h5')  # creates a HDF5 file 'my_model.h5'
del model  # deletes the existing model
model = load_model('my_model.h5')
I've checked that keras is up to date. Is anyone else facing this issue? thanks for your time
