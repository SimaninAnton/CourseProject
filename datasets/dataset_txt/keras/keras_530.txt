Dear all
I have used large vocabulary for encode and decode layer. In this model, I used fit_generator function to handle input of encode layer by smaller batches.
The problem is number of neuron for dense layer, since the number of output words is more than 500000. Can I use DNS layer output based on the power of two? For example, with 10 neurons produce 1024 number. Is correct my idea? Does anyone have any other suggestions?
