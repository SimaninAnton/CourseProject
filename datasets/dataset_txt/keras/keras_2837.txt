BUG report ^.^
I have re-define the top_k_categorical_accuracy to
def top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred): return metrics.top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, 1)
And as the model training finished, I saved it to my local disk by mode.save(mypath), but I have got this exception while I load model to other process:
unboundlocalerror: local variable 'class_name' referenced before assignment
It was from:
File "<PYTHONPATH>/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/generic_utils.py", line 157, in deserialize_keras_object
Absolutely, it a variable which not been assign before using it. In the exception code block, the unit-test may not cover it or the code's static check issue?
Thanks for read
