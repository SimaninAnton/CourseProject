A major use-case for the scikit-learn API is automating hyperparameter opt. With the current API we need to either:
Search through nb_epochs, duplicating most of the computation (essentially every nb_epoch except the largest is redundant).
Implement getting the best epoch ourselves, possibly using EarlyStopping or the like.
Would it be possible to just have KerasClassifier.fit() return the best epoch?
