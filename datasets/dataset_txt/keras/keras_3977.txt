I am trying to get the shape information of the arguments passed to the objective functions in Keras, but I always get missing input errors.
For example, the following code:
def custom_mse(y_true,y_pred):
    print K.eval(y_true.shape)
    return K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1) 
returns the following error when executing model.compile:
theano.gof.fg.MissingInputError: ("An input of the graph, used to compute Shape(dense_2_target), was not provided and not given a value.Use the Theano flag exception_verbosity='high',for more information on this error.", dense_2_target)
The same function runs fine without the K.eval line. What is wrong with my code? Is there no way to access information/attributes related to the objective function arguments?
