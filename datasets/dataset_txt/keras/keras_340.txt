Thank you for your awesome library.
I am having trouble saving the weight of the model.
I think there is a problem when the filename is long.
Error message
model.save_weights(model_name, overwrite=True)
*** OSError: Unable to create file (unable to open file: name = 'D:/Python_output/Speech_Emotion_Recognition_CNN_Capsule_Image_Decoder_RNN\datasets/IEMOCAP\SER-Capsule-Model-Toy-Improv-5cross-Valid-800-300-Low\model_data\00_model_lr_0.0005_routing_2_filter_size_3_11_filter_channel_8_16_primary_13_4_32_output_32_dense_256_512_linear.h5', errno = 2, error message = 'No such file or directory', flags = 13, o_flags = 302)
If the file name is shortened as follows, it will be saved successfully.
model.save_weights('D:/Python_output/Speech_Emotion_Recognition_CNN_Capsule_Image_Decoder_RNN\datasets/IEMOCAP\SER-Capsule-Model-Toy-Improv-5cross-Valid-800-300-Low\model_data\hello.h5')
Why does this problem occur? I want to solve it.
Thank you so much
