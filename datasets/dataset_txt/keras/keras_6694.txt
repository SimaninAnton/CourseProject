This isn't a bug, but seems a little technical for the user group.
I have an h5py dataset with shape (300,000, 60, 50). My 8GB ram laptop will not consider this an acceptable transaction.
However, loading the h5py dataset straight into the model (i.e. without creating a numpy array from it) throws an error.
Am I doing something wrong, or is the h5py format not supported as an input tensor in either Theano or Keras?
