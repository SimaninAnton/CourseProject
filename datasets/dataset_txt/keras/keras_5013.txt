Hey guys,
I'd like to design a RNN/LSTM network to predict in real time, i.e. once received an input at a time t, the network will give an output y_t. And the input from t=0 to t=n is a sequence.
I have read all tutorials/examples in Keras related to RNN/LSTM, but still can not find a way to solve the problem.
Let me explain the problems with two figures:
The input at training period is illustrated in the following figure (the first one), and you can also check the second figure for input fed into the model at prediction period.
Please correct me if something is wrong in the figures.

As illustrated in the figures, an example fed into the network is a sequence at the training period, but when I use the trained network to predict in real time, the input fed into the network is a data point of a sequence (i.e. features at time t of a sequence) rather than a whole sequence:
so how should I structure the input to make the model works at both training and prediction sessions? How would my input be at the training period?
Since the length of a sequence is varied, should I use marks/tokens like "START", "END" to label the start/end position of a sequence? If so, is there any examples/tutorials in Keras demonstrated it? If not, how should I process the varied sequence in Keras?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks.
