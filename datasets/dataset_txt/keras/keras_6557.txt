Hey, I am currently working on a LSTM Music Composer.
Looking at the required Input Shape of LSTM the Documentation states as follows: Input shape: 3D tensor with shape: (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim).
I was wondering what nb_samples, timesteps, and input_dim actually mean exactly. I know it must be obvious, but I couldn't figure out what nb_samples is exactly referring to.
So I am going to feed my LSTM RNN with a piano roll like representation of a Midi File. So it's a matrix with ones and zeros, 1 meaning note_on, 0 meaning note_off. So what I have as piano roll is a matrix with each row representing one note (= input_dim?) and the columns representing one Midi tick (timing in midi files) (= timesteps?). This tells the Net which Note is on at what point in time. But I can't figure what the third dimension should be in my case.
Thanks for your help!
