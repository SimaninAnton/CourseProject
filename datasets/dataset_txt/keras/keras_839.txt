[x ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras.
[x ] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version.
[ x] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).

Hi, running the script I get the error :
ValueError: Error when checking target: expected lambda_2 to have 1 dimensions, but got array with shape (1, 1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "D:\PycharmProjects\ensmbleNN\NNmodel.py", line 21, in
model.fit(x,y)
File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\keras\engine\training.py", line 950, in fit

'with shape ' + str(data_shape))
ValueError: Error when checking target: expected lambda_2 to have 1 dimensions, but got array with shape (1, 1)
Please help, searched but did not find a solution.
Thank you
