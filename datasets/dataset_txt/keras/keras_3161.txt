As far as I understand, the mnist_siamese_graph.py example converts the image arrays of size 784 into feature vectors of size 128. How can I get these vectors for all my train examples? I have been trying the guidelines provided here with layer_name='sequential_1' but I get the following error:
AttributeError: Layer sequential_1 has multiple inbound nodes, hence the notion of "layer output" is ill-defined. Use get_output_at(node_index) instead.
Here's the code snippet:
layer_name = 'sequential_1'
intermediate_layer_model = Model(input=model.input, output=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model.predict(X_train)
`
Any ideas? Thanks!
