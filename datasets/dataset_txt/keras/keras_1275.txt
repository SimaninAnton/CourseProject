@fchollet, I recently wrote an factorized version for all the ResNet variants with pre-trained weights including ResNet, ResNetv2, ResNeXt, and WideResNet (total 11 models). If they are added here Keras, will it be hard to manage and cause more problems? or will it be useful? What do you think about adding the 11 ResNet models?
