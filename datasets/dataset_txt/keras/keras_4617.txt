Let's assume I am in a python shell and I start training a model:
model.fit(X,Y, batch_size = 8)
Works like a charm, but now I want to try a larger batch size:
model.fit(X,Y, batch_size = 16)
MemoryError: Error allocating 52428800 bytes of device memory (CNMEM_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY).
Alright, that was too much, let's go back to the batch size that worked before
model.fit(X,Y, batch_size = 8)
MemoryError: Error allocating 26214400 bytes of device memory (CNMEM_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY).
woops, suddenly I can't train my model anymore. I've encountered this problem in different keras/theano versions. Running the most recent versions of both now and I can still observe this behaviour.
