Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Code to reproduce the bug
The code creates a Bidirectional SimpleRNN layer upon an Embedding layer with masking. (Using LSTM also gives the same bug.)
The hidden states of the SimpleRNN backward pass are not the same when the paddings (input 0) are placed in different positions. The forward pass seems to be fine.
