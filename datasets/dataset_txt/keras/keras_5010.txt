I want to use Spearmint for Bayesian Optimization in keras.
Keep in mind, I think I am using a fairly older version of keras - last clone around January.
Any ideas how I can integrate Spearmint into keras? Can someone please give me a concrete example of this?
On a similar thing, instead of using Spearmint, I tried hyperparameter optimization with "hyperas". It did seem to have much easier examples of how to use hyperparas in keras. However, I run into the following error, which I think is because I am using the older keras version?
model.add(Dropout({{uniform(0, 1)}}))
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/hyperopt/pyll_utils.py", line 48, in hp_uniform
raise TypeError('require string label')
