I have been learning keras. I would like to know how to connects models in the following scenario
"""
                      M1
                    /      \
                 M2     M3
                   \        /
                      M4
"""
M1, M2, and M3 are different models. I want to connect them in such a way that output from M1 is input to both M2 and M3 models and the overall model is trainable. Input is through M1.
