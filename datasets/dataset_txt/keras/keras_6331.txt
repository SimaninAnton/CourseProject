I tried to run:
a = K.random_normal((100, 200))
and I got the error:
/home/eders/python/Theano/theano/sandbox/rng_mrg.pyc in get_substream_rstates(self, n_streams, dtype, inc_rstate)
   1167 
   1168         """
-> 1169         assert isinstance(dtype, str)
   1170         assert n_streams < 2**72
   1171         assert n_streams > 0

AssertionError:
I tried to print K.common._FLOATX to see what was going on and it is u'float32'. That little u upfront is making theano crash. I believe that when reading the type from json it was not converted to the right type of string. Anybody else had that problem? I'll check the code to see if I can fix it.
