I am working with the medical tumor images, where the maximum size of input images are 40x40, and minimum sizes are around 20x20. I made a small CNN network, where 100x100 image size is giving me best result.
I fed the images and they were automatically interpolated to 100x100.So, what is the interpolation approach keras is using in the background? is it bi-cubic interpolation or linear interpolation or any other interpolation?
