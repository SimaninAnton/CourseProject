Hi!
I fine tuned resnet50 on keras 2.1.6 and it was running well. I used the avg_pool layer.
Runing the same code in my remote host with keras 2.2.0, no avg_pool layer.
here is the code
base_model = ResNet50(weights=weights_path, include_top=False, input_tensor=Input(shape=(224, 224, 3)))
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten(name='flatten')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
x = Dense(class_count, activation='softmax', name='fc8', kernel_initializer=RandomNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.001))(x)
net = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x)
net.summary()
Thanks for any help
