Hi, everyone. I find a core dump error when I want to use keras model to do prediction on test data. I have successfully trained a keras model whose input is a sentence and output is a scalar score. Then I define a prediction method as below:
model = load_model(model_path)
pred = K.function([model.input], [model.output])
scores = pred([input_data])
The scores can be successfully computed, but after all the scripts are done Python throws core dump error. Although it does not affect the result, I use shell script to judge whether the process is successful and it will exit since an error is thrown.
Has anyone come across a similar problem? I think it might be a destruction bug.
