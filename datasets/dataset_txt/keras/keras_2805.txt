I am experiencing a much longer wait time between epochs in Keras2 training on my cpu with tensorflow backend. I used generators for both train and valid by flow_from_directory and the code style is still in Keras1 so there is no mistake in specifying number of steps when fit_generator. I used both model checkpoint and csvlogger as callbacks. Any idea?
