Let's take the /keras/examples/cifar10_cnn.py as an example. In the first fully connected layer (after flatten() operation), the code is model.add(Dense(64*8*8, 512)). My question is that why it is 64*8*8 instead of 64*2*2. As far as I am understanding, the input size is 3*32*32 (the original image size), after two MaxPooling operation and one MaxPooling will reduce the input size by a quarter right? Thus, the input size should be 32/4/4 = 2 which gives 64*2*2. Please correct me! Thank you. (@fchollet )
