Hi, dear all,
I have two inputs. One is with length of 50, the other one is with the length of 50. I will concatenate them along the time axis. The output length should be same as the input 1 (50). When I use keras and its extension Seq2seq, I define the input length is the summation (50+50) and output is 50.
However, when I use masking layer, it has the error:
ValueError: GpuElemwise. Input dimension mis-match. Input 1 (indices start at 0) has shape[1] == 100, but the output's size on that axis is 50.
If I remove the masking layer, everything is OK. Could anyone tell if the masking will see the output and detect the length of the output? Should I make the input and output exactly same long?
Thank you.
