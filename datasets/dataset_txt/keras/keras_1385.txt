keras.utils.multi-gpu-model(model,5) will not work well with ModelCheckpoint callback. It throws a "cannot serialize IO object error." I guess I understand why this might is happening since multiple copies of the same model span my gpus but I am not sure how to fix it.
Any workarounds? It works awesome otherwise.
EDIT: Closing this issue. Saving weights works just fine.
