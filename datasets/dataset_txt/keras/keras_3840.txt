If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:

Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
First of all, thanks for your great package.
In the file https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/tests/keras/layers/test_core.py
you did not utilize merged model in the structure of your new model (after line 56 and 78 of the file). Moreover, I cannot understand how you create lambda and callable function version of merge parameters. (lines 54-56 and lines 76-78)
I think we need more detailed gist of merge as it was very important!
Thanks again.
