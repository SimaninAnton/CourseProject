I get the warning that Merge is about to be deprecated soon. How would I go about doing the following merge in the new keras?
cat_model = Sequential()
cat_model.add(Merge(cat_models))
If I do the following as suggested by the warning I get the error: TypeError: ('Not a Keras tensor:', <keras.models.Sequential object at 0x118c63a58>)
from keras.layers.merge import add
cat_model = add(cat_models)
