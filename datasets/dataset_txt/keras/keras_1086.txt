I have an issue with the installation of Keras with conda package manager. There are several channels where keras is hosted, the most popular one being conda-forge. When using cond-forge, a script is added and launched when activating a virtual environment where the variable KERAS_BACKEND is set to theano by default, overwriting any configuration in the keras.json file.
The second issue come when installing keras with the default channel conda install keras. Here again, an environment variable KERAS_BACKEND is set to theano by default, but I did not found where it is set. The only workaround I found was to tweak the keras.backend.__init__.py file and commenting the environment variable import.
My question is then, do you work with conda to package keras or is it their own initiative ?
