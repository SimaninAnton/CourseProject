I installed keras using the steps mentioned by @purificant in this thread #11628
Which is like following:
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.7 keras-test
pyenv local keras-test
pip install keras tensorflow
echo 'from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard, ModelCheckpoint' > test.py

$ python test.py 
Using TensorFlow backend.
However now I can't deactivate the virtual environment. This issue was also posted here pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#289
Any help will be highly appreciated.
