It would be useful if we could get a square diagonal matrix from a vector of values similar to the diag command from tensorflow. Currently to do this I utilize broadcasting; I create an identity matrix and multiply(*) with the vector. However that depends on the backend function "eye" which is implemented via numpy and I run into other problems when I do that. The main one is that I can't pass the batch size as an argument to "eye" because it is variable("None").
(Disclaimer: I've only used the Tensorflow backend so I'm not sure how the Theano version would play out)
