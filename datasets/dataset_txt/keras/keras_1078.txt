The "Dense" layer has parameters "kernel_initializer", "kernel_regularizer" and "kernel_constraint" which in my opinion are quite confusing names. I have not seen the weights in a dense layer being referred to as "kernel". The docs say "Initializer for the kernel weights matrix". I assume these parameters are named for consistency with the convolutional kernels and changing them might be tricky (though I'm not sure if consistency with the convolutional layers is really a good criterion here).
But I think the documentation could be a bit more clear. If the docs just said "weight matrix" instead of "kernel weight matrix" I feel that would be easier to understand.
