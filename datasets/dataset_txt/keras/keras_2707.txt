I just read the example code in https://keras.io/layers/wrappers/#timedistributed
But I really don't understand why the output shape is (32, 10, 8) instead of (32, 10, 32), especially
the last comment says "# now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 32)"
Could someone explain it?
Thank you very much in advance!
