It seems to me that OrderedEnqueuer can utilise multiple threads whilst GeneratorEnqueuer cannot. For instance, when I use a generator that is of type Sequence, workers=n where n > 1, more than 1 core is utilised. However, when the generator is not of type Sequence, only 1 core is used regardless of the number of workers. Is this valid observation? If so, how come OrderedEnqueuer isn't bound by GIL?
