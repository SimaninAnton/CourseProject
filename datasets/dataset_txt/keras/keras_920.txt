As of 354bd35, EarlyStopping callback allows only to specify a baseline. That value is used to stop training when monitored quantity is worse than the baseline. To my understanding, what's missing is the ability to specify a value to reach for the monitored quantity before considering to stop training. Say you want to stop training if stable but you want to reach at least an accuracy of 95%. Right now you can't.
