Hey guys, hi have a neural network design in mind that needs the output of the embedding layer to be fed to two layers.
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding)
Now I want the output of the embedding to be fed to Layer 2 and Layer 3
model.add(Layer2) , model.add(Layer3)
I would also need to add more layers to these layers (Layers 2 and Layer 3) independently and combine them later on.
Thanks in advance
