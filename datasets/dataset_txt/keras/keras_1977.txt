Hi,
I have a pretty simple gist reproducing the problem: https://gist.github.com/izikgo/2579b8c26231d5c9a5a2c7d313860d33
In short, I get VERY different results between test and validation in a CNN with BN layers, even when I cancel scale and center, on the exact same data. The data is only a single batch of size 128 from the MNIST dataset.
Anyone knows if this is an acceptable behavior? I know that BN acts differently in train and inference, but the difference looks too big to me.
Thanks,
Izik
