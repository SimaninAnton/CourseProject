I've been trying all the MNIST examples from the Keras documentation as well as the cifar10 and they just don't work if I use the GPU.
The Accuracy is always below 0.1 or NaN.
If I do it on the CPU it works correctly and if I do it in the GPU with float64 it also works correctly although slowly.
I've tried to restart the laptop |(like another user suggests) and also cleaning and purging theano-cache, but the problem remains.
My system is a Mac OS X 10.10. With a GTX 750M.
Theano without Keras works properly in GPU float32 with other libraries/examples.
