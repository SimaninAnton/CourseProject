Many people come to Keras with input size misconceptions, as demonstrated by the questions on StackOverflow and the question-issues listed in this repository. The paradigm of (all_batches, sequence_length, input_dimensions) seems simple enough, but various settings in your network can throw you off. For example, confusion can be cause by trying to stack RNNs or making a Dense layer TimeDistributed Greater transparency about expected (what parameter set what shape expectation) and received input would be appreciated.
I would like to take a shot at implementing this. Have previous attempts at this been done before? Am I missing a previous discussion about this? If not, I will put more effort into precisely defining test-cases and expected behaviour.
