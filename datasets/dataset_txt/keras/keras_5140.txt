Hi,
I've implemented a model where I use dropout, however when I use Y_pred = model.predict(X_test, batch_size=test_batch_size), I receive an error using the theano backend.
I know that the error is related to the learning phase (i.e. train/test phase). I don't receive this error when using the TensorFlow backend, but for some reason, this backend is painfully slow on 1D Convolutions by a factor of x10, which is why I would prefer to use the theano backend.
I know that from the FAQ's, there is a way to switch the learning phase, but I can't figure out how to implement this on Y_pred = model.predict(X_test, batch_size=test_batch_size).
Could someone please show how this can be implemented? In future updates, it would be nice if there were a switch in model.predict() function for train/test phase such as phase='test'
Thank you,
Eren
