I've laid out an API suggestion for application of attention mechanisms in a recurrent setting.
Full design review doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psFXnmMlSTg5JapgZKz26ag-zBu3ERrxkKoEzNpzl4w/edit?usp=sharing
There is a proof-of-concept implementation of the API in my (play-ground) add-on library extkeras as well as an example of its use in model training.
There is still a lot of work needed, but if you think it's a good general direction I'm happy to take lead in completing the implementation.
Happy for all feedback at any level!
