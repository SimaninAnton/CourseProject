We need to update examples, like:
here nb_epoch should be used.
Similarly at:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/antirectifier.py#L102
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py#L100
and few other places.
Also this should be keras.utils.np_utils.to_categorical
I can send a PR for this.
