I have a tf.keras model which contains a Batchnorm Layer.
This is what I want to do:
Keras model => Checkpoint files => frozen_graph.pb => Load frozen graph (ERROR)
I get the following error message:
Input 0 of node inference/conv1_1_3x3_s2_bn/cond/ReadVariableOp/Switch was passed float from inference/conv1_1_3x3_s2_bn/gamma:0 incompatible with expected resource.
Here is a jupyter notebook which reproduces the error:
