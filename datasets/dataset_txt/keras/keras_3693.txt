Hi, I find posts like this for image using cnn:
https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-cam
https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html
Any idea on doing this for a LSTM network (a keras implementation of this document classifier(they call it QA but it is not)):
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03609v1.pdf]
If anyone knows any resources or has any idea, please let me know. I cannot find any open source code from people publishing pictures of highlighted text.
Currently, the only thing I can think of is either replacing LSTM with CNN or stacking the LSTM with a CNN and adapt the image code.
Many thanks in advance for any feedback
