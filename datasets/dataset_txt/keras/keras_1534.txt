The Keras v2.0.9 is out and it packs lots of cool features. Go team! :)
One particular challenge that we face every time there is a new release is the fact that breaking changes are not documented thoroughly. As a result we are forced to scan through all the commit messages to make sure they will not break our code. For instance in this release we spotted a couple of breaking changes which are not included in the release notes:
The num_class variables are renamed to num_classes
The random_seed variables are renamed to seed
The Image.Iterator inherits directly from Sequence, which means any class that extended it is now considered a Sequence. An additional update on the fit_generator() leads to the use of OrderedEnqueuer instead of the GeneratorEnqueuer if the underlying generator is a sequence which can break your code.
The fact that Python does not have proper encapsulation complicates the matters, as it relies on conventions to mark private members. In addition there is currently no way to mark the classes that should be considered public vs developer_api.
I think it would be great within the next releases, to mark all the "private" class methods/vars with "_" if they are meant for internal use, create an annotation to distinguish between public and "private" classes and ensure that whenever we change public parts of the code to include them on the release notes.
Any thoughts? :)
