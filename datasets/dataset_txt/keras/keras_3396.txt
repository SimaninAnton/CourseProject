Hi I'm trying to implement a subclass of Model while after copying source from github, I'm keeping getting this issue:
TypeError: _standardize_user_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'check_batch_axis'
After taking me quite a long time to find errors, I checked my local source codes and find the my local version doesn't support 'check_batch_axis':
def _standardize_user_data(self, x, y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, check_batch_dim=True, batch_size=None):
And this is the github code:
def _standardize_user_data(self, x, y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, check_batch_axis=True, batch_size=None):
So could someone tell me how to keep my Keras updated? I'm using ubuntu 16.
