The per-epoch validation (e.g.: using validation_split=0.25) is broken for AutoEncoder with output_reconstruction=False. This is because in the AutoEncoder class:
    def get_output(self, train=False):
        if not train and not self.output_reconstruction:
            return self.encoder.get_output(train)

        return self.decoder.get_output(train)
This source code is currently located at: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L1174
For validation purposes, Keras uses y_test = output.get_output(False). Since both train and self.output_reconstruction are False at this point, the validation output will be encoded values rather than reconstructed values, leading to a dimension mismatch. Since output_reconstruction=False, this leads to validation being broken for the majority of AutoEncoder users. I hoped to submit a fix for this, but I wasn't quite sure of a way to fix within the context of Keras. I might have time to fix this if given a direction, if not, I will just leave this bug report here.
