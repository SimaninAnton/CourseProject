Hello,
I am trying to implement a Lambda layer to reverse the following operation
out = np.c_[data[::2], data[1::2]]
where data is a 1D array
Using numpy, I would do it as
a = out[:]
a[::2] = out[0:len(out)/2]
a[1::2] = out[len(out)/2:]
I tried
t0 = K.eval(input_data)
t1 = t0[:]
t1[::2] = t0[0:5163]
t1[1::2] = t0[5163:]
return K.variable(t1)
But this returned the error - "You must feed a value for placeholder tensor"
What's the right way to do it?
Thanks
