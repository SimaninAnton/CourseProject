CS229 is the Stanford machine learning class, taught by Andrew Ng. This year a number of student projects were implemented using Keras. I thought it would be interesting for the Keras community to check them out:
Sign Language Recognition using Temporal Classification
Energy Consumption Prediction for Optimum Storage Utilization
Contextual Code Completion Using Machine Learning
Deep Learning Stock Volatilities with Google Domestic Trends
Object classification for autonomous vehicle
navigation of Stanford campus
There may be more projects that I'm missing, either because they weren't indexed by Google or because they didn't cite Keras (100% of students use one or several open-source packages to implement their projects, but few of them actually cite their tools, probably only around 10% do). For comparison, I could find 1 (one) project using Torch, 4 (four) using TensorFlow and 3 (three) using Caffe.
