I am training an LSTM model for multiple time-series regression. But, my losses are always either very high or Nan. I have tried several optimizers such as rmsprop, adam and sgd. Here's the script:
sgd = SGD(lr=0.0008, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
# Build the Keras Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(MAX_TIMESTEPS, MAX_FEATURES)))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_absolute_error',
              optimizer=sgd)

print 'Training the LSTM model'

batch_size = 32
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=20, validation_split=0.2)
mae = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test, batch_size=batch_size)
X_train is of the shape (N_SAMPLES_TRAIN, MAX_TIMESTEPS, MAX_FEATURES)
Y_train is of the shape (N_SAMPLES)
I should add that the Y values I am trying to predict are very high. Any idea where I might be going wroing?
