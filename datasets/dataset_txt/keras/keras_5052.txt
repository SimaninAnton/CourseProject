Hi,
Can someone point me to the exact part of the code where gradients are being computed in the code?
I am aware that callbacks can be used to view the gradients. However, I want to modify the update equations by dividing the trainable_weights into different classes.
Can someone help me with the exact part of code where gradients are calculated?
I tried putting a breakpoint in backend/theano_backend's gradient function. However, that does not seem to work.
I am guessing since it is a symbolic function, it must be somewhere else.
