Embeddings obtained from training a discriminative NN towards a specific task can be extremely useful on related tasks (e.g. Transfer learning). We can extract a lot of potentially useful embeddings by looking at the weights of a layer of the model. By looking at the documentation http://keras.io/models/ it doesn't seem like Keras supports the abstraction of extracting weight values from individual layers. Seems like it would be relatively easy to implement.
