This is the implementation of my model.
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from keras.layers import Embedding
from keras.layers import LSTM

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max_features, output_dim=256))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
This model can be successfully trained on CPUs, although it's slow. But if I install tensorflow-gpu to train the model on GPUs, Segmentation fault (core dumped) occurs while executing the line model.add(LSTM(128)).
python 3.6.4 is installed. I have tried keras 2.0.8 and keras 2.1.2, and both of them cause Segmentation fault (core dumped).
I wonder why it occurs and if it's possible to fix it.
Thanks!
