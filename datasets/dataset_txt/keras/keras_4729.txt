Hello I would like to take the characteristics of my last layer of a network already trained on other issues seen that one way was this:
weights = model.layers[9].get_weights()[0]
I performed a test with 420 samples in training and 210 on the test. But the weights are only 570 vectors with 500 features representing the output layer 9. I would like to know how the weights? For my idea is to get the features extracted by CNN and conduct an experiment with SVM and compare the results. Thank you in advance
