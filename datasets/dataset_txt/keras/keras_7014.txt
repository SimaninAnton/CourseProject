Hi all,
I tried to run the cifar cnn example and I have some troubles getting my first results.
I have a decent hardware config (gtx 980) and my .theanorc config seems to be ok:
[global]
device=gpu0
floatX=float32
allow_gc=False
[nvcc]
fastmath=True
I see that my GPU is used by theano (Using gpu device 0: GeForce GTX 980) and a bump in memory used using nvidia-smi.
First question : do I have a problem?
Second question: what could I do to speed up the learning?
Thanks!
