The documentation for RNN tells me that:
Masking: This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number of timesteps To introduce masks to your data, use an Embedding layer with the mask_zero parameter set to true.
However, my data is already "embedded", so to speak. That is, I have variable length 3-dimensional sequences that are zero padded to be the maximum length of the sequence in the dataset. Two examples:
X_1 = array([[ 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 46. , 1. , -1.12], [ 637. , 1. , -1.35], [ 754. , 1. , -1.09]]
and
X_2 = array([[ 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 0 , 0], [ 444. , 1. , -1.35], [ 555. , 2. , -1.09]]
So the first layer in the network is an LSTM - no embedding is required. How do I tell the LSTM that the zeros are masks to be ignored?
Thanks.
