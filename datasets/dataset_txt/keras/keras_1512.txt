Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I've noticed when updating to Keras 2.0.9 that the class probabilities for predictions on the "creative_commons_elephant.jpg" image used in tutorials change significantly (i.e. African_elephant goes from 0.909 to 0.789).
Here is my script:
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')

from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

img_path = 'creative_commons_elephant.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = preprocess_input(x)

preds = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])
Under Keras 2.0.8 this gives:
('Predicted:', [(u'n02504458', u'African_elephant', 0.90942073), (u'n01871265', u'tusker', 0.086183183), (u'n02504013', u'Indian_elephant', 0.0043545808)])
However under Keras 2.0.9 it gives:
('Predicted:', [(u'n02504458', u'African_elephant', 0.78988522), (u'n01871265', u'tusker', 0.1987267), (u'n02504013', u'Indian_elephant', 0.011142471)])
