Hi,
I am new to keras and trying to learn.
I want to create and train neural network with 5 node input layer, 16 node hidden layer and 5 node output layer. Input and output are same. After training want to discard output layer and then hidden layer should output. (AutoEncoder problem ??)
          * * * * *                   <- Input layer

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *       <- hidden layer

          * * * * *                   <- Output layer
Couldn't find any example related to it where output layer has more than 1 node output ( went though otto and imdb examples)
Can I get some example or go ahead ?
