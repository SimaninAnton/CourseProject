Hello,
I have used offline generation to make a large number of training examples (~millions) and I would like to evaluate the fit with the validation set more frequently than just at the very end of the epoch. Is there a good way to do this within keras's current methods? I could not see an option that would let me set a the number of batches at which the validation accuracy could be tested.
Thank you
