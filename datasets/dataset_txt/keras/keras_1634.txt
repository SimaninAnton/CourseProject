Hi all,
I'm trying to train two networks A and B. Ideally, B is optimized according to its own loss plus the loss of A (for every iteration).
For some reasons, I cannot merge the two networks.
I tried using an API model and thus the loss of this model is the sum of loss A and loss B (you can see the model structure using the url at bottom).
To check if the model really work as I expect, I set the weight of loss of A and B to be 0 and 1 respectively. In such case, training network A should only depends on the loss of network B.
However, if I do so, network A cannot be trained at all.
Any idea?
