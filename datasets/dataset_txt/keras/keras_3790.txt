Hi,
I want to use a custom merge layers, where the inputs are two 1D vectors (outputs from 2 1D [CONV-POOL] models) and I want to generate a scalar output which computes (X1.T * M * X2.T), where M is the similarity matrix (parameter of dim d*d, X1 and X2 are d dim vectors).
Current merge layers only supports functions and I cannot figure out a way to add parameter to the model.
Thanks,
