Hi,
I am implementing a deconvolution in my project. I had used tf.nn.conv2d_transpose, but using Keras layers proved to be more efficient. I replaced tf.nn.conv2d_transpose with Keras layer Conv2dTranspose.
From the documentation they seem to do the same, however I am getting different results. Are the underlying operations the same? Has anybody already tried using both? Is there anything that has to be done different with Keras Conv2dTranspose?
Thanks.
