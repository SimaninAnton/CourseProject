While Convolution1D and other types of 1D layers support specifying the data format of the input data, *Pooling1D layers such as MaxPooling1D do not. This has been brought up as a GitHub issue #10570 and StackOverflow questions (example). I propose a fix that addresses this problem:

I have coded everything already (all changes written in Google Docs; not that big of a change) and tests for the modified layers pass. I would appreciate any comment/feedback regarding the proposal.
