I'm experiencing hard locks when trying to predict labels in parallel using joblib. I tried using multiprocessing directly instead of joblib and the same thing happens. The function that runs in parallel and that calls keras model (trained using tensorflow's backend) just gets locked, no prediction is made and the processed gets hung forever. This happens both on Mac and Linux.
The example in the gist I'm referencing below can't be run without the trained model, but it illustrates the kind of problem I'm talking about. Following the example should be enough to reproduce this issue.
