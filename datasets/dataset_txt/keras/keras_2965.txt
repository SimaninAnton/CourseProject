I think evaluation data have to be independent from training and validation data.
How do you use test data set after Cross-validation
What is the difference between test set and validation set?
But in the some examples, validation data is used as evaluation data.
keras/examples/imdb_lstm.py
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=15,
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
score, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test,
                            batch_size=batch_size)
I think we have to use validation_split to make evaluation data be independent.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=15, validation_split=0.2)
score, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test,
                            batch_size=batch_size)
If this fix is reasonable, I'll make pull request.
