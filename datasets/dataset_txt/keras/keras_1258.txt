"It is diffcult or impossible to do obsure(very unique) things in Keras", this is what an expert in out department has suggested me. He advised me to switch to TF. We are working on a Deep learning Project, which might lead us to propose our own CNN architecture and very different way of back-propagation, where loss function will be calculated at different layers simultaneously. We will be using CNNs inspired architecture for reconstruction and denoising of images. I am well familiar with CNN for classification in Keras, therefore I would obviously try to stay with Keras. Also learning curve of TF is little higher compare to KERAS. SO my question is what do u think of that guys statement "It is diffcult or impossible to do obsure(very unique) things in Keras"? Has anybody experienced it?
