#Hi, I found in the current keras, All input arrays (x) should have the same number of samples.
For many multi-input and multi-output models, it is more desirable if we can define different number of samples (aka. batch-size) for each inputs.
This is really important for the case one input X1 is much 'cheaper' than another input X2.
Say now I have two inputs X1, X2 and two outputs Y1, Y2.
Y1 = f(X1) and Y2 = g(X1,X2).
The mapping X1->Y1 is much faster ('cheaper') to train than the mapping X1,X2->Y2.
So I may desire a large batch size of X1 and a small batch size of X2.
Or is it possible to hack the current code so as to make input with different batch-size possible?
Looking forward to anyone who can give me some suggestions. Thanks!
