Hello folks,
My aim to ask this question is that, there is no unified answer for getting producible results with Keras-Tensorflow on GPU. So, If you'd like to answer, that'd be better to all of us.
I tried the following:
Import numpy. Seed it. Then import all other libraries
https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-obtain-reproducible-results-using-keras-during-development
What is the correct way of doing this?
Thanks in advance
