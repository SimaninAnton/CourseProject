Hello guy, i am studying Face Recognition.
And i red this blog post: https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/
I try to make it, and it works. But i still have a few questions in mind:
When i encode my image with the pretrained weight from that blog post, i have array with 2622-dimension length. Is this because the last conv layer is 2622?
What kind of feature of the face that keras taken for prediction a face? Is it length of eyebrows? eyes? mouth? Nose? Jaw? Because when I put a face image, it produces an array with 2622-dimension length with no further details about what feature that has been extracted to make an array with 2622-dimension.
Thanks.
