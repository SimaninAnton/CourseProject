Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I am using Google Colab to train a CNN and then save the entire model to a .h5 file. The code is available here: CNN-Colab
The model gets saved but when I later try to load it back, I get the following error:
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'dict'
The entire Output log is here: CNN - Colab - Error
