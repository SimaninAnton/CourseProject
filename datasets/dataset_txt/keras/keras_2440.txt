Hi, I am trying to combine keras (theano backend) with Pymc3, I found that Keras does not support such weight initialization as Lasagne does. Is it possible to add support for symbolic initialization in keras?
#6546 - It is the same issue as mine. I also get the missing input error.
Here is a link to a github gist of the code:
