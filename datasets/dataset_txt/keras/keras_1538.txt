Hello there, I recently started using the YellowFin optimizer in my models (keras implementation here), which is implemented through the TFOptimizer class. This kind of an optimizer has a few downsides, but one I was not expecting was the fact that it does not apply constraints!
Looking through optimizers.py, it becomes clear that every other optimizer has an explicit section in which constraints are applied (Example: SGD), however TFOptimizer does not.
Is this intentional? Is there some fundamental reason behind why a TFOptimizer cannot have the constraints applied to it in the same way as other optimizers? It seems to me we can still iterate over the parameters, check for the constraint attribute, and if it exists, apply it.
