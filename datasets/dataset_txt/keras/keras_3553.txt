Hi.
I have a suggestion on BatchNormalization's axis parameter. The parameter has default value -1. For image task, it makes sense only if image dim ordering is tf.
This can cause trouble for novice users. Every other layer like Dense, Activation, Convolution2D, etc. works magically just after setting 'th' in keras.json. However, BatchNormalization does not. It needs explicit setting of axis. See, as an example, this question on a MOOC course which is about the axis default value.
My proposal is as follows: If not set explicitly, have axis parameter rely on dim_ordering in keras.json just in the same way we set dim_ordering for Convolution2D. As an example, we can change the default axis value to None and then look up json file's dim ordering if it's not set explicitly.
Thanks
