I need to save a neural network model with names of input features and names of outputs. So I need to save a config, weights and two lists:
input_features_labels (list of str, ex.: ["length_cm", "diameter_cm", "weight_g_normalized"])
output_labels (list of str, ex.: ["age_prediction", "gender_prediction"])
I found very useful method keras.models.save_model(model, filepath) but it seems I can not put there my own arguments (two lists with labels) and save all information into one file.
Maybe is it possible to specify input and output labels within Sequential Model, so I could restore model from file with also restoring exact list of names of input features and outputs? I found that sometimes keras uses concept weight_names but I haven't figured out how to set it for input and output layers so it would be restorable.
Any recommendations for solving this problem?
