The backend package uses a print call in its __init__.py file to inform about which backend is going to be used (the "Using X backend." messages).
This is bad design, keras is a library and libraries should never ever call a print function.
To reproduce just type:
import keras
A variant of this issue is #1406, where the nature of the problem has been misdiagnosed as directing that print function output to stdout, and the issue has been "fixed" in 83aaada by directing the output to stderr.
The state now, with that print output directed to stderr, is the worst behaviour ever: stderr is used by the Python logging module, and thereofore the "Using X backend." messages get mixed with the log messages of the application(s) using keras.
This is a major issue for a library: in complex applications it is common practice to aggregate logs on a central server or on online services, and having a line printed like this on stderr, without the same format as the other log messages (i.e. timestamp [severity] - module - message), is messing everything up.
I propose to either start using the Python logging module instead of the print function (which is the right approach, and for which I will shortly submit a pull request), or at least to move back to printing that line to stdout (not nice, but acceptable).
