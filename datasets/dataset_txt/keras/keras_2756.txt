This is a new feature request.
In Caffe, SigmoidCrossEntropyLossLayer can specify a label to be ignored.
This feature is required for the implementation of Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, which says "The training ignores pixels that are masked out (as ambiguous
or difficult) in the ground truth." in section 4.
How to mask binary crossentropy loss? - Google Group mentions this feature. In this thread,
def binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.binary_crossentropy(tf.multiply(y_pred, tf.cast(tf.not_equal(y_true, -1), tf.float32)),
                                        tf.multiply(y_true, tf.cast(tf.not_equal(y_true, -1), tf.float32))), axis=-1)
was the answer, but this implementation only supports TensorFlow.
Do you have any ideas about the implementation of ignore label in cross entropy functions?
Do you think this feature should be supported in Keras?
