Hi,
I would like to use the gaussian noise layer as first layer in a CNN: https://keras.io/layers/noise/
But I need this layer to modify the pixels within the range [-N,N], and in my case it would be a very small one.
I've seen that the parameter sigma is the standard deviation of the gaussian function. But is it the classical centered gaussian function: f(x) = 1/(sigma * sqrt(2 * PI)) * exp(-x_x/(2 * sigma_sigma))?
If yes, then I can invert the function to compute the sigma I need.
Is there a way to visualize/display the modification done by this layer?
Regards,
