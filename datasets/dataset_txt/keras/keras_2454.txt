I have a network built using the Model API and I'm using LeakyReLU activation functions for my layers. When it comes to the moment of saving the structure, I get this:
AttributeError: 'LeakyReLU' object has no attribute '__name__'
Example of a layer of mine:
x = Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation=LeakyRelu(alpha=1e-1), padding='same', activity_regularizer=SparseReg(beta=5e-1,p=1e-2), name='lay3')(x)
Is creating a custom non-linearity the only way to using the LeakyReLU with a Model API? I read from #3816 and #2272 that you can't use an activation layer as activation function inside another layer, say a Conv2d but those refer to a model built using Sequential API.
