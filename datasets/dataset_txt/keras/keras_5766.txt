Here is a proposal for a new API to replace Graph: https://gist.github.com/fchollet/314085fffa200de9c3da
Why?
Graph was verbose, inelegant, and at times impractical. This is a more beautiful way to build networks.
What about backward compatibility?
This is planned to be 100% compatible: anything that used to work will still work after these changes.
It looks super similar to Torch's nngraph...
Indeed it does. Amazingly enough though, it was developed independently after watching an advanced user reacting negatively to the Keras Graph API --I realized they were right (I never liked Graph tbh), and started to search for ways to make Keras functional. It turns out there is only one API (modulo a few details) that you can converge to in order to make layers functional while keeping 100% backward compatibility, and it is this one.
Please post any feedback or comments on the Gist page.
