My code works fine with Keras 2.0.6 and Tensorflow-gpu 1.3.0. When I reinstall my computer and my code throw exceptions from the model.load_weights() call with Keras 2.2.4 and Tensorflow-gpu 1.12.2. The error message is:
RuntimeError: The Session graph is empty. Add operations to the graph before calling run().
I google this error and find that there was some similar questions before. It seems relate to the Keras and Tensorflow version.
What is the better solution?
Thanks!
