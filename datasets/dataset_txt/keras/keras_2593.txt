I’ve upgraded to the new verison of Keras and I’m noticing a huge a drop in the performance: from 200 seconds per epoch on the old Keras to 40,000 seconds per epoch on the new Keras.
Attached are two shots showing training on the old Keras and on the new. The models have same architecture are confirmed to both be utilizing the same GPU during training. They are both coded with the functional API. The problem does not change when using different tensorflow backends (0.12 and 1.0).
After doing these side-by-side tests, I’m thinking this may be a bug with Keras.
Training Output of Keras 1.1.0 (270 sec/epoch):
Training Output of Keras 2.0.3 (38000 sec/epoch):
