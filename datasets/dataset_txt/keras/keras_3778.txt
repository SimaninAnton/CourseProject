As the title states, when I run the mnist_acgan example the discriminator loss quickly goes to zero and the generator loss increases over time. The generated images at the end of each epoch are black. I'm digging into this myself, but GANs aren't my area so I expect progress to be slow. Any suggestions on where to look? Is anyone able to run this example without any problems?
