I have a pretrained model for sentiment analysis that was trained on texts with maximum length m_1 and now I want to put the model in production for texts with maximum length m_2. How do I easily do that?
I've tried changing m_1 to m_2 in yaml model definition file before loading weights, but that seems to be a too hacky approach as my model now outputs only NaNs.
