I ran into an error while using model.save_weights()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cnn2.py", line 160, in <module>
    model.save_weights('model_weight.hdf5')
  File "/home/cy/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/keras/models.py", line 379, in save_weights
    g = f.create_group('layer_{}'.format(k))
ValueError: zero length field name in format
Could anyone help ?
Besides, the HDF5 libraries dependance is not automatically checked while installing.
Thanks
