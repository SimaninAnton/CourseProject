I implemented a class to be able to use slices of an HDF5 dataset as data matrices/vectors in keras. Even though the class emulates the ndarray API (at least for len and __getitem__ stuff), you can't call np.asarray on it. Since I am not sure on how this could be fixed, I preferred to post this as an issue to ask for advice. Maybe we could change it such that it only calls np.asarray if it makes sense (i.e., its input is a list, list of tuples, tuple, tuple of tuples, tuple of lists or ndarray?
The class in question is in the following gist: https://gist.github.com/jfsantos/14ae9631716a2aa328c4.
