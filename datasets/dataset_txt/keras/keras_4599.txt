I am running into an issue when putting my own data into the lstm example on the keras website. The only changes I mean to make are to fit the dataset I am working with into this example.
I created a gist here: https://gist.github.com/thecolorblue/5b672e706db17e744c935a4995747c1c
But to summarize I get this error when calling fit:
Exception: Error when checking model target: expected activation_3 to have shape (None, 1) but got array with shape (10, 11)
Here is the model:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(10, 32, input_length=11))
model.add(LSTM(32, activation='sigmoid', inner_activation='hard_sigmoid'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
