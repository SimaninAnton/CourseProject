Hello,
In the Keras older versions, you could not pass images smaller than 197x197 px when using the resnet50 network. However, in the new version (i.e. 2.2.4) it is possible to do that. I am wondering what is happening? Maybe Keras performs some sort of resizing or zero padding internally?
Cheers,
