The problem is that I have an output a from a LSTM layer with the shape of (batch,step,hidden), and an output b from another layer, which is called the weights(or attention), with the shape of (batch,step), and I have no idea how to do an operation which computes the weighted sum given the two outputs.
like this:

a0, a1, a2 = a.shape
b0, b1 = b.shape
for i in range(a0):
for j in range(a1):
for k in range(a2):
c[i][k]+=a[i][j][k]*b[i][j]

Can this be done in keras?
