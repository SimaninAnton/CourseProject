Hi. Have a question. I was reading an article at http://www.wildml.com/2016/08/rnns-in-tensorflow-a-practical-guide-and-undocumented-features/ and came to know about tf.sequenceexample and how it is able to prepare data for both non-sequential variable and sequential variable. Is there a similar thing in Keras (tensorflow)? How does one normally prepare data for non sequential variable before processing into LSTM? Would appreciate if there's an example as well. Thanks.
