Just did fresh upgrades of Keras and TensorFlow today, and there seems to be a change to the TensorBoard API that isn't reflected in the Keras callback implementation. When I train a model with the TensorBoard callback:
tb = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=nb_batches, nb_epoch=nb_epochs,
    verbose=1, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), callbacks=[tb])
I get a warning:
WARNING:tensorflow:Passing a GraphDef to the SummaryWriter is deprecated. Pass a Graph object instead, such as sess.graph.
