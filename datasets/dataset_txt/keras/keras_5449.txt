Hi,
I am using a LSTM network for sentiment classification. I ran it for 100 epochs and then plotted the training and validation accuracy. The training accuracy curve shows a rise but there is not much change in the validation accuracy.
I have done 10 cv by taking 10 different validation sets and running the model from the scratch.
Is something going wrong in my model?
