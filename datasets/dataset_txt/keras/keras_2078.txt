The following attempts to use the models from keras.applications all cause errors either during weight loading or inference on Theano because keras attempts to download weights for Tensorflow:
from keras import aplications
import numpy as np
applications.InceptionV3().predict(np.random.rand(1, 3, 299, 299))
applications.VGG16().predict(np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224))
applications.VGG19().predict(np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224))
applications.ResNet50().predict(np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224))
This can only be circumvented by downloading the theano weight files and loading them manually. For reference, this is my config file
{
    "image_dim_ordering": "th", 
    "epsilon": 1e-07, 
    "floatx": "float32", 
    "backend": "theano",
    "image_data_format": "channels_first"
}
