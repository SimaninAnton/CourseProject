Is it possible to compile a subgraph at a time using keras? For example, in multitask setup, where we minimize the loss of multiple tasks. Diagram taken from the issue #1441
Can we pass training example from lang1 only and update the parameters relevant for the lang 1 and at another time for the lang2 and so on?
