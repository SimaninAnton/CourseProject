My dataset have the following shape
x_train = (8758, 13, 40,48)...input
y_train = (8758,18)..target
In more detail 8758 is the samples, 13 is features and each feature has values in 20,28 as image data.
The challenge is to convert that input into [samples, timesteps, features]
I try to flat the last two parts to become (8758,13, 1920) so that the input shape to lstm could be (1,13,1920) and output (1,18)
I am looking for advice how to break input dataset into right shape to get good generalization and good results
thanks
