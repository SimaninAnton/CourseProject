I'm currently working on a project to predict hashtags.Below, is the idea I am trying to implement.
We have a million tweets each with one hashtag at the end of the tweet.We feed each tweet without the hashtag to an lstm network (using the embedding layer of keras or word2vec embeddings) and minimize the cosine similarity of the word vector of the actual hashtag and the vector of the predicted sequence of hashtag( using cosine proximity as objective). I'm new to RNNs and LSTMs so it would be great to have some help. Thanks
