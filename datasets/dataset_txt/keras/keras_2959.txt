After switching to keras 2.0.0 and progressively migrating our code base (containing various custom layers and losses) it seemed that there were a bug in the way models are now created from a config. More specifically, the custom_objects arguments passed to model_from_config is lost in the back and forth between the deserialize_keras_object defined in generics_utils and the from_config method in models resulting in an error ValueError: Unknown layer: ....
The only solution that I've found is to introduce two simple modifications in the Model.from_config method:
Add a custom_objects={} argument
Pass this argument to each layer_module.deserialize call in the layer loop.
Did I miss something or is it indeed a problem with this new version? If it is should I submit a pull request?
