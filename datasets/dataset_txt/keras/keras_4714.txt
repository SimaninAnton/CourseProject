The loss function of my main model depends on outputs from a secondary network. So I need the symbolic outputs from certain layers of the secondary model when compiling my primary model.
The following code can give me the output for an intermediate layer if I have a numeric input:
get_3_layer_output = K.function([model.layers[0].input, K.learning_phase()],[model.layers[3].output]) result = get_3_layer_output([X_train, 1])[0])
Is there any way I can get the output for an intermediate layer with X_train being a symbolic variable instead of a numeric array?
