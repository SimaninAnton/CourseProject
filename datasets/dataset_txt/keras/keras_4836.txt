"InvalidArgumentError: GraphDef argument to Extend includes node 'MatMul_12', which was created by a previous call to Create or Extend in this session."
When training multiple models in same Ipython notebook (same Kernel), after first model successfully executes and I try to run second model at a new cell, I keep encountering this error. Tried working code from Keras Examples.
The code works fine if I run it at different Ipython notebooks but turns out same error if I run it on same notebook.
Any further information on this would be helpful. Thanks
