During construction of layers such as Convolution2D and Dense. The argument init can only be set by name (e.g. 'normal', 'uniform'). Is there a good way to pass parameter such as 'scale', 'loc' into initialization? Or we should manually initialize weights and pass by argument weights for each layer?
