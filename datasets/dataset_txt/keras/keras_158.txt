When I use convolution layer's get_weights() method to get the weights,first,I set channel_last,and I get the weights,let's say 3x3x3x8,8 means the convolution layer's output filter number.when I set channel_first,I use the method get_weight(),I still get weights has shape 3x3x3x8,I think it maybe wrong,isn't it should be 8x3x3x3?
