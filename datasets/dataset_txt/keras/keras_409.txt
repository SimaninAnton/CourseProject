I would like to have a procedure to deprecate something or fix bugs that cannot be fixed because it would cause a major breaking change (like the infamous off by one error in keras.preprocessing.text).
Right now, we have no resource to achieve this and once we agree to a procedure, it should be added to the wiki and to the CONTRIBUTING.md.
We have several different cases (with my proposition) :
Deprecate an argument
DeprecateWarning till the next minor.
Passed this date, remove
Deprecate a function
DeprecateWarning for 2 minors.
A bug that is fixable, but we did not fix it (off by one)
Make a V2 of the function with the bug
Add a warning in the faulty function that the user needs to switch to the new version.
If I forgot a case, please add a comment and I'll add it.
I don't think there are many resources to do this the right way. I'm open to suggestions.
