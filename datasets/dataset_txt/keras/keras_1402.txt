This is my first issue. I hope this is the right place for it.
In the keras mnist cnn example : https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py
the validation and testing uses the same set x_test
This might give of the wrong idea to some of the new comers that test sets can be used for validation.
If this is a valid problem, I will make a PR in which I split the train set into train and validate.
model.fit(x_train, y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=epochs,
          verbose=1,
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
