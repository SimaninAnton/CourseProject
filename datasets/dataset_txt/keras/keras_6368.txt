Here I want to use LSTM to do IMDB sentiment classification task, now ,I don't use the embedding layer to generate my word2vector.
I construct the vector by myself.
now , with the problem:
I use LSTM in the first layer ,so i need to comfirm the input_shape.
According to the doc, it tell me the input_shape is (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim).
Now, here I show a expamle.
the longest length of review sentence is 25 ( 19 + 2*3(pad) )
every word2vector dim is 300
how can I make the input_shape?
 I make LSTM(128, input_shape=(25,128)) , 
 it export 'Wrong number of dimensions: expected 2, got 3 with shape (50, 25, 300)
 here 50 is the batch_size = 50, the input data struct is [40000,25,300 ]

 then I make LSTM(128, input_shape=(1, 25*128) , 
 data also become [40000,25*300]
 it export 'Wrong number of dimensions: expected 3, got 2 with shape (50, 25*300)
Thanks advance
Here is my simple model struct ï¼š
data.shape is [40000,25,300]
model.Sequential()
model.add( LSTM(128, input_shape=(25, 300)))
Another struct
##model.add( LSTM(output_dim = 128,input_dim = 300, return_sequences=False) )
###model.add(TimeDistributedDense(label_class))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
modle.add(Fallten())
model.add(Dense(output_dim = label_class,a ctivation = 'sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss = 'binary_crossentropy', class_mode = 'binary', optimizer='adam')
