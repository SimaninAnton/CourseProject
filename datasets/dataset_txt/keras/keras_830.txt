Dear all,
I have a question about the function flow_from_directory.
I am working with medical images. These images are coming in nifti format (ending .nii). I would like to rotate/scale these images. So, I would like to use the datagenerator.
Is that possible to use the data generator with these images? I could only find examples that worked with .jpg and .png images...
Thanks a lot for your answer,
regards
