Hi, I am trying to implement a word by word attention model and one of steps i need implement is a custom RNN node. A SimpleRNN node implements the following equations,
s_t = Tanh(U x_t + W s_{t-1})
o_t = Softmax(V s_t)
where s_t is the state variable for the RNN and o_t is the output
I want to implement a custom RNN node which does the following,
s_t = x_t + Tanh(W s_{t-1})
o_t = s_t
Can this be done using Keras? Please suggest any possible methods.
I am building on the code provided here #2067. I think this is a related issue #2017
