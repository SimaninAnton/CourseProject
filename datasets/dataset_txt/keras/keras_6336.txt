Hello,
I'm wondering if it's possible to implement a network that takes in an image (RGB images with pixelwise labels) and outputs a probability map of the same size using Keras, I've built the convolutional layers follows by a series of deconvolutional layers and unpooling layers, the output of the final deconvolutional layer will be the same size of the input image, then if I do
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd')
will it be able to produce a probability map of the image and do the learning?
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
