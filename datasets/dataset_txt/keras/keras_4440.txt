Hi,
I am trying to run the code of imdb_bidirectional_lstm(https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py) on theano backend. But each time I try to run it, I got an error of Floating point exception (core dumped) after first epoch. Can you please suggest what am I doing wrong ??
