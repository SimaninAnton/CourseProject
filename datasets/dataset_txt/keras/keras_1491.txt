keras should check to ensure the output vector size is appropriate for the cost function. For example, you can pass binary_crossentropy as a cost function with outputs that are of shape [batchsize, 28,28,10]. Keras is happy to compute with this setup though I'm not sure what exactly is going on. Probably keras should tell me to stop being dumb and move to categorical_crossentorpy.
