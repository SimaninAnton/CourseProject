Hi, I try to load weights into the BatchNormalization layer, but got an Exception: You called set_weights(weights) on layer "batchnormalization_1" with a weight list of length 2, but the layer was expecting 4 weights.
Why do we have 4 weights here? I did not find out the reason in the documentation ?
Thanks
