I am willing to clarify my confusion regarding these methods evaluate, fit',test_on_batchandtrain_on_batch`.
One confusion is that: in the fit, there is option that you can set portion of the training data as the testing data. Is that the same, if I just choose same percentage of my data and put them into evaluate? And the only difference is, as how I understand: in fit, test set are chosen randomly, whereas in evaluate, the test set are just the data you give.
There are also methods like test_on_batch and train_on_batch. The difference between them and fit and evaluate is that: in test_on_batch and train_on_batch, you only test or train on one batch, but in fit and evaluate, you do this on plenty of batches.
Thanks.
