Looking at keras.utils.Sequence as a possibility to feed a large dataset into a model I came across this line. I might misjudge the context, but it looks to me as if Sequence will pre-fetch the entire dataset (as batches) and then yield single batches from memory.
This makes me wonder, what is the intended use case of Sequence? I think there are more convenient ways to feed a dataset into Keras if it is in memory anyway. I wonder if this is a bug or intended behavior, but I can't tell from the information I have. Please advise.
I can always overwrite __iter__ and create something that actually loads batches from disk, but since this is not recommended anywhere or talked about, I'm not sure if this is the intended approach.
