Hi. I feel confused about the structure of rnn.My model is as follows:
tsteps = 50
dropout=0.5
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(150, input_shape=(tsteps, 3)))
model.add(Dropout(dropout))
model.add(Dense(2))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
My understanding of this model is:
The input data size is 3d (x1,x2,x3), and the model take every tsteps 3d vector as a whole.
There are two layers in this model.
The LSTM layer has 150 neurons, so the output dimension is 150.
The dense layer has 3 nerons, so the output dimension is 3.
Do I understand it correctly?Thank you in advance!
