Currently, the metadata for models (specifically the model, not layers/other components) is not persistent in the H5 save of a model. A trivial example of this is the name of the model, which can be changed via model.name but does not persist.
Coupled with the second issue, of non-unique model attributes (again, such as the autogenerated name), organization and tracking of models falls, essentially, on the file name of the saved model.
I'd like to see the ability to save some model metadata (such as the iteration tracker #4611, the name, etc.), as well as the use of the UUID module to create a UUID for each newly created model that is permanent for the life of the model.
