Dear All,
Just curious, are there any workable fully convolutional network implementation using Keras? One of the essential operation in FCN is deconvolutional operation, which seems to be able to be handled using tf.nn.conv2d_transpose in Tensorflow. In Keras, what is the corresponding layer for this? Thanks a lot.
