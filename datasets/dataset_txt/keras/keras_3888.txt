Is there an image generator functionality for object detection tasks. Imagine we are detecting a single type of object and I have images with labels showing the bounding boxes for the objects per image. Does Keras have a generic function for those type of setups? If not is it a useful enhancement?
By the way, I am aware that I can crop the images for positive and negative classes, save them separately in folders and treat this problem as an image classification problem. But I am deliberately staying away from that option.
I would appreciate any comments. Best.
