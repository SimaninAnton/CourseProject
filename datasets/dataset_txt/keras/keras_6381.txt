Hello,
When I try to run the imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py example, the model fails to build, and it throws the following error:
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/layers/recurrent.py", line 385, in __init__
    super(LSTM, self).__init__(**kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/layers/core.py", line 23, in __init__
    assert kwarg in {'input_shape'}, "Keyword argument not understood: " + kwarg
AssertionError: Keyword argument not understood: go_backward
I'm using the latest Keras from pip, as well as the latest Theano from github, as was suggested many times. The error obviously occurs even when I try to create a backwards LSTM layer in my own models.
Any clue why this might be?
