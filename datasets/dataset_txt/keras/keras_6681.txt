I've tried to pickle keras.callbacks.History object after training, but it failed with infinite recursive loop of objects. A quick look showed that the loop is in the Container object of the Sequential model, references inside the History object.
My question is: do you want the object to be pickle-able? if so, I can reproduce and provide logs. Otherwise this issue can be closed as far as I'm concerned (I just dump History.history dict to JSON which is all I need).
