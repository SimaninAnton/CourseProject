running Keras MLP for a regression task. Most of the time it runs well, however it happens that when I try with different seeds, sometimes the NN does not converge (it predicts all 0s). I would have expected the result to change with different seeds as it does most of the times that I run it, but to the point of not converging? Could you advise?
I am using the following basic network:
topology: 1 hidden layer; neurons: in=2xfeatures, hidden=1xfeatures, out=1
dropout: 0.001 at input
activation: = all relu activated
loss: mean_squared_logarithmic_error
optimization: Adam with default parameters
On the following data:
17k points with 34 features
