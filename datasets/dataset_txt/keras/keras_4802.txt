I'm following this tutorial. The code version I currently have can be found here.
When I try to run the code, I get the following:
Using Theano backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “hypercolumn.py”, line 85, in
get_feature = theano.function([model.layers[0].input], model.layers[3].output(train=False), allow_input_downcast=False)
TypeError: ‘TensorVariable’ object is not callable
How can I solve this issue?
Thanks.
