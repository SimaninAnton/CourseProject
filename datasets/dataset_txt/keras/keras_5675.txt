I have a script that worked just fine in a previous version of keras. Running the script on distribution 0.3.2, I get all sort of error messages. Is there any 'from-to' type of document to go through and be in an easier position to update older keras scripts?
PS: some sample lines of the script are:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dropout(self.dropx[0]))
model.add(Dense(nb_features, self.nb_neuronx[0], init='glorot_uniform'))
model.add(PReLU((self.nb_neuronx[0],)))
and one of the errors I get:
Exception: Layer is not connected. Did you forget to set "input_shape"?
