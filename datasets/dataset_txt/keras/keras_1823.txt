Hi,
I want to write a custom loss function involving two different outputs from one network. I'm not sure how to do it because I cannot access each prediction separately. So in Keras, what is the structure of y_pred and y_true when you have multiple outputs and targets?
Any idea is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
