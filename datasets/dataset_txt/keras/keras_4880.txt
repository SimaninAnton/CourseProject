Update: Question answered on Stackoverflow. I did not know that the weights are saved at the Layers and not at the model.
Hi!
I have posted my question on stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38053073/how-can-i-change-a-network-after-initialising-in-functional-api) but maybe I will have here more luck.
I would like to change the fully connected layers of alexNet/googlenet with pretrained weights - the problem is, I cant just .pop and .append it, because although i add a new layer (with 8 classes) the network still works like it has 1000 classes.
But if I start the network with a Dense(8) layer, I cant load the pre-trained weights.
I've found a workaround for alexnet, but i struggle with the googlenet
