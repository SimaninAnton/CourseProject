When I customize the loss function, I want to get the specific value of the y_true dimension.
I tried y_true.shape, y_true.get_shape(), y_true.get_shape().as_list(), and K.shape(y_true), but Will report an error because of data format and other issues.
Does anyone have relevant experience? Who can help me? thank you very much!
