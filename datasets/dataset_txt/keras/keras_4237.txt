Following the discussion on slack, I am trying to compile a list of questions from the last 3 days for the purpose of finding trends and updating FAQ. The current idea is to compile a summary page for issues during a period, say weekly, and picking candidates to add to FAQ.
You are welcome to share your thoughts, specially on
whether this is useful
how to go about it by using community efforts - commitment from specific people might not be a long term solution.
I have spent almost 2 hours compiling the questions from last 3 days - somehow longer than I expected.
collection of questions fr om both issue pages and gitter, slack groups
formats of this sharing
For this experiment, I have put questions in the following categories.
_bug_: bug reporting
_documentation_: chance for revision of documentation
_configuration_: installation, configuration, integration with other tools
_performance_: need suggestions for performance improvments
_customization_: lego-building new layers/models by Keras
_enhancement_: feature requests, modifications for Keras itself
See the compilation below.
