Before the new update, if all the output layers are named and in graph model, calling predict(X) will return a dictionary. The new API seems can only return a list of prediction. Will the predict be able to output dictionary in the future? There are some inconsistence because the fit() function can take in "y" as a dict while the predict() cannot. Thanks!
