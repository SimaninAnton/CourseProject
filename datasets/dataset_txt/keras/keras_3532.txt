Hi everyone !
I try to train a GAN on cifar10 to generate pretty images. But it seems unable to learn anything.
I tested the discriminator, and he seems to be the problem, because he learns nothing. And I don't see at all from where the problem could come. The loss never decrease or increase (For both the discriminator and generator)
Here is my code : https://github.com/kushia/cifar_gan/blob/master/cifar10_gan.py
I'm really stuck, and it don't seems normal at all to me..
It seems the discriminator is like "Frozen", even when I set the trainable parameter to true..
Thanks you!
