My first few hours with Keras were needlessly a lot more painful than needed, because I didn't realize most of the examples at http://keras.io/examples/ and elsewhere were geared at categorical, not binary classification (which is what I personally assumed by default) - and when I realized, I didn't realize how important that was. My models weren't learning anything...
So, right at the top of http://keras.io/examples/, I'd propose to have two MLP variants, one for categorical classification and another for binary classification - sigmoid inst. of softmax activation for final layer and passing class_mode='binary' to .compile() (the former is tricky to realize for machine learning newbies and the latter is almost undiscoverable).
(For Google users benefit, I also documented my experience at http://log.or.cz/?p=386 .)
