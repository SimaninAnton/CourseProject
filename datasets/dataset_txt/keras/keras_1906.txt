Hello,
I have a question about the training procedures.
I have GPU with low memory so I can't increase my batch sizes(up to 4 images), therefore I want to train a model in a way that the networks update the weights after some batch iterations not in every batch iteration. Is there a way in keras to do this?
Or, Does anyone know a solution to increase batch size with low memory?
Thanks
