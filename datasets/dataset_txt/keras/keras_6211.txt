There is no show_accuracy for the Graph model (Graph().fit(...)). Should there be? It is in the base class (Model().fit(...)) has one and Sequential has one too.
Is accuracy not valid for the Graph() structure?
I am using the objective categorical_crossentropy. [0, 1, 0]. It says show_accuracy not supported.
