At the moment, it seems only binary version of hinge loss is implemented as objective function (equivalent to binary_hinge_loss in lasagne). Shouldn't the name of this objective better reflect the fact that is the binary version, i.o.w. be named binary_hinge instead of just hinge?
Also, wouldn't it be good to mention in the docs that the binary hinge loss function should be used with labels being {-1,+1} instead of {0,1}?
Finally, does anyone have an idea how I can implement the categorical version of hinge loss (equivalent to multiclass_hinge_loss in lasagne)?
