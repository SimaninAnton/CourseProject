The code doc says:
 `avg` means that global average pooling will be applied to the output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
Starting at ln232, the code is:
    x = AveragePooling2D((7, 7), name='avg_pool')(x)

    if include_top:
        x = Flatten()(x)
        x = Dense(classes, activation='softmax', name='fc1000')(x)
    else:
        if pooling == 'avg':
            x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
        elif pooling == 'max':
            x = GlobalMaxPooling2D()(x)
AveragePooling2D is applied to the output of the last convolutional layer and then GlobalAveragePooling2D is applied. Is that correct?
I ask because I get the same extracted vector for 'None', 'avg' and 'max'.
