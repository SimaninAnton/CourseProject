Hey, I don't know if it is possible to specify the GPU number when I want to play something with NN (training or prediction). And I may use different GPUs for different parts of my code.
I ask this question because I want to use Keras to train a network with triplet loss. And I want one GPUs to do the BP. At the same time, I want to use another GPU to do forward and help me to choose the "hardest" positive or negative pair. If I could use multiple GPUs, I think the training procedure would significantly speed up.
I do know in tensorflow, it is possible to do so using "with device", but I use theano now and I wonder if it is possible to simulate this behavior just using the Keras wrapper?
