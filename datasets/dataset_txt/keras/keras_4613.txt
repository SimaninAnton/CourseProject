Hi! I am very new in Theano and Keras, apology for my ignorance.
When stateful==False, the state is [None, None]. but the step function uses the state, ie h_tm1 and c_tm1.
Keras' LSTM certainly works when stateful=False, using the code from Philippe Remy's blog with settings USE_SEQUENCES = False and USE_STATELESS_MODEL = True: the model quickly achieves 1.00 accuracy. That means the state cannot be [None, None], otherwise the model wouldn't be able to learn. Would it?
I do not understand. Could someone explain this?
By the way I am trying to implement the encoder-decoder structure by Cho and Sutskever, and I am at the phase of understanding "keras/layers/recurrent.py".
Many thanks in advance!
