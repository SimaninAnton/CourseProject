Hello,
I'm trying to implement SegNet ( http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/ ) as a part of a project I'm working on and have stumbled onto this issue.
I'm using the VGG 16 architecture as in the original paper and still enroute to implement index based sampling. But before that, I can not get Keras to Upsample the data from 22 to 45 as seen in the image below.
It downsamples from 45 to 22 but (as expected) upsamples from 22 to 44. I've tried searching for custom upsampling layers - and I'm about to write my own for it, but thought its worth an ask here.
(I checked the code in Caffe - Caffe's Upsampling layer either lets you specify the upsampling factor or the desired width and height - didn't find those parameters in the UpSampling layer here.)
Any help appreciated!
