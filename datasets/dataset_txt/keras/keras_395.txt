I would like to request a very simple layer: multiply inputs by a constant and / or add a constant bias. This can be used to include input normalization into the network. In this way the network can be made more self-contained and distributed with less instructions on how to prepare the inputs.
Furthermore if the network is converted to TensorRT for inference, the multiplication and bias most likely get merged into other convolutional layers making it most efficient.
