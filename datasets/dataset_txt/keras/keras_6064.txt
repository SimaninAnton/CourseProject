I just read the Keras Documentation, in which I meet one sentence "Building a network of LSTMs, a deep CNN, a Neural Turing Machine, a word2vec embedder or any other model is just as fast".
Had someone implement a Neural Turing Machine to process texts using Keras? Could you let me study the codes and method? Thanks a lot.
