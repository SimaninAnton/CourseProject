I used pretty much this code here https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py to train MNIST dataset and got very strange effects in other applications. I have a GeForce 690, which has two GPU each 2GB RAM, so it should be enough for the rather little convolutional network.
On the right, where the strange things happen, is normally an Java application called JetBrains PHPStorm.
Several things I could imagine:
GPU RAM full, which wasn't the case.
GPU RAM access collision, which shouldn't happen?
GPU is dying?
Another interesting facts: Does only happen with the convolution layer. Stops when the training is done. Artifacts increases when I start another conv net at the same time.
Anyone else ever noticed such behaviour?
