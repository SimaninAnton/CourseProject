Hello all
I am using LSTM (follow an example at https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py) to classify the text with 6 classes.
My code can be found at:

However, the results when I printed the values is always 1 (my classes ran from 0 to 5), and of course, it does not work.
How should I fix the issue?
Thanks a lot,
