Seems that some styles don't work well with the script for some reason. I utilized the "Starry Night" by Van Gogh as the style image, with the mask provided at https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/online-neural-doodle , along with the target mask as shown below.
For some reason, the blue swirls (red colored region) are completely ignored. The following image is after 80 iterations.
Changing the color of the masks, or slightly altering the mask itself has no noticeable effect on the final result. The following image is after 10 iterations.
Neural Doodle with different mask color
As can be seen in the 80 iterations image, the buildings and the dark brown tower, as well as the swirls in the sky are drawn correctly, but the blue swatches (masked in red) are just drawn in a gray color. This gray color does not change in any of the 80 iterations.
