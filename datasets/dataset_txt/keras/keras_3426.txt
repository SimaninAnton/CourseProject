Hi, I am trying to build up a network with two parallel sub-networks in Keras.
Each sub-networks will take its own input, and on top of that the hidden value from the top layers of these two networks will be concatenated.
I plan to use Merge to do the concatenation. However, I am a little bit confused about the input part. How can I do that?
I have already build the model with sequential model object, like E1 = Sequential(); E2 = Sequential(), Can I use Model() to contain them, and use the Input function?
Thank you.
