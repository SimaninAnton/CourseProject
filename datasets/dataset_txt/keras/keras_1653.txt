keras 2.0.8 gets installed (> python setup.py install) but while importing it in python for a local user, keras does not get imported.
import keras
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
ImportError: No module named keras
But when I import keras from superuser, it works fine. With every in installation, .keras directory is generated in root only. Please suggest the solution?
