Here is my project:
I have plenty of files describing a process
each line of the file describes the process parameters status at 1second spaced from previous
I would like to categorize those files into two families, let's say OK and KO
I wrote some code to collect the interesting data from files so that comes with 2000 timesteps with 13 params over 300 runs (files).
I so wrote some keras code to categorize the runs (files):
model.add(LSTM(650, input_shape=(2000, 13), return_sequences=True)) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(650))) model.add(Dense(1)) model.add(Activation("softmax"))
When calling model.fit, I get the following error:
ValueError: Error when checking target: expected activation_1 to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (200, 1)
I have no idea how I can go from TimeDistributed to Activation"Softmax"...
