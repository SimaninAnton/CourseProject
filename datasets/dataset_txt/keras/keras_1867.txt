Hi,
I'm not pointing a problem, I'm just wondering how I can manage to do what I want. I explain myself :
For an image X, the Y that I want to predict is a couple of numpy array [Y1, Y2]. Y1 is (38, 60, 18) shaped and Y2 is (38, 60, 72) shaped. As I am working with a big dataset, I would like to use the train_on_batch function. However, this function should take a numpy array of X values (which is not a problem) and a numpy array of Y values. Because Y1 and Y2 are not of the same shape, I can't stack them into a single array, and using a list raise an exception because train_on_batch calls the Y shape. Does anyone has an idea about how I can trick that ?
Thanks for reading
