Hi,
I am using fixed point numbers within my network. My concern is when there are multiplication operations in the network on theano variables, the result is float32 ( even if the numbers supplied are in fixed point). Is there any intrinsic way to get the result in fixed point format, or even int.
If not, what can be alternative approaches?
