Hi,
I recently encountered an issue with serialization/deserialization of models.
When someone create new type of model (e.g. we have GenSequential for loading data on the fly from generator) problem occurs when one tries to load it from file.
In models.model_from_config there is a list of possible models, which doesn't count on newly created model types. Even if one modify this one, problem persist in keras.models.container_from_config where the same list comes to play again.
I have a feeling, that initialization of model should be part of Model itself - only thing to do from outside is to choose right model and pass json to it. Model itself should be able to initialize itself from it.
flow:
load json
pass it to the load_from_config()
check if such a name exists in a namespace
call class method of such model class and let that object initialize itself
thats it
I can write such mod, but I would like to hear a bit from community.
What do you think? Did I miss something? Does it make sense?
Regards
Jan
