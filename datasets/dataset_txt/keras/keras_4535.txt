Hello!
I am trying to define custom objective function for my network and I ran into several questions, would be very grateful if you can help me to solve them!
As I see in the source of objectives (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/objectives.py#L48) the error will be taken as mean value along last axis. I have network that have as input 3D volume and as the output again 3D volume - I am making a prediction for each voxel. So the dimensionality of the arrays in the objective is (5,1,215,815,215) (I have only 5 training volumes). And I really do not understand whether it is even valid to take the error as mean on the last dimension.
Are there any native methods for using weighted objective? I have highly unbalanced distribution of classes inside the volume and I need to add weights to get correct classification after training.
Thanks a lot!
