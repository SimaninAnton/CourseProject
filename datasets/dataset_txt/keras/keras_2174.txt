I'd like to add an utility into np_utils.py to randomly sort data and labels. Because we have to do so before using model.fit with validation_split that is taking data and labels as validation data without shuffle.
Here's my question,
My PR can be made for Keras master branch or should be for keras-contrib?.
What kind of tests shoud I make for this?
