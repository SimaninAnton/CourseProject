I updated keras from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0 using pip. Then the model training became dramatically slow.
0.2.0: each epoch costs 284s.
0.3.0: each epoch costs 6149s.
Updating keras directly from github makes it much better (635s per epoch), but still 2 times slower than 0.2.0.
My GPU is GTX 780 and My model is CNN+GRU.
