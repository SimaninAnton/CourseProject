I'm trying to implement this paper: Semantically Conditioned LSTM-based Natural Language Generation for Spoken Dialogue Systems, in which they add a gate to LSTM and change the way in which cell state is computed.
So I want to change the internal structure of LSTM layer. Anyone knows how to do that?
