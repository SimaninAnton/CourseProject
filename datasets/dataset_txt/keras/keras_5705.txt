hist = model.fit(train,train_label, batch_size=32, nb_epoch=10, verbose=1, show_accuracy=True, validation_data=(test, test_label))
print (max(hist.history['val_acc']))
In my opinion, the codes as above shown, have leveraged the labels of test samples because of early-stop according to the accuracy of validation_data. Am I wrong? max(hist.history['val_acc']) cannot be selected as my experimental result?
Should I modify the codes like this:
hist = model.fit(train,train_label, batch_size=32, nb_epoch=10, verbose=1, show_accuracy=True, validation_split=0.1)
score, acc = model.evaluate(test, test_label, batch_size=32, show_accuracy=True)
print (acc)
However, as far as I am concerned, the finall "acc" is not the best experimental result, because after 10 epochs, the model may be not the best, the best model may be among the 10 epochs.
Please give me some suggestions, many thanks!
