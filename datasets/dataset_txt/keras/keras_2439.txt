I have a loaded model before, i save in file h5, and json. So i want to load it in multi thread, each thread i loaded model to use predicted separate,
Then keras get error:
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 267, in init
    fetch, allow_tensor=True, allow_operation=True))
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2405, in as_graph_element
    return self._as_graph_element_locked(obj, allow_tensor, allow_operation)
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2489, in _as_graph_element_locked
    raise ValueError("Operation %s is not an element of this graph." % obj)
So Can I just load same model through all thread ?
