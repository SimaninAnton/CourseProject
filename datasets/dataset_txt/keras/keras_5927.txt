For a Sequential model, I can do
model.fit(..., show_accuracy=True)
which will show the accuracy on the train set (and also validation set, if given). I tend to visualize these over the epochs.
For a Graph model, this option is missing. Why? Can it be easily added? After all they are both derived from the Model class...
