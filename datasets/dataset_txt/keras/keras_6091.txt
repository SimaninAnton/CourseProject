When training NN by calling the fit_generator, exceptions/errors in the generator function are omitted since they are executing in a different thread.
There are two possible solutions:
Instead of running the generator in Thread object, run it on a subclass which properly prints exception backtraces and errors.
Change the example on documentation to make it explicit that possible errors will be omitted and add a try: block on the example generator code
