Hello!
I've tried for some whiles to figure out how to set different learning rate for some specific layers. E.g., when I'm using a CNN (say, ResNet), I would like to set the LR of BN layers (or more specially, the parameter BETA of BN layers) to (0.1 * global LR). But it turns out that I cannot simply achieve this without modifying lots of the database.
So, could anyone tell me how to set layer-wise LR multiplier, or some other ways to do the same work?
Thanks in advance!
