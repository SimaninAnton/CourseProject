I've taken a look at Keras' batch normalization code and it looks like it's normalising along the wrong axis
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/normalization.py#L64
This means that the axis parameter specifies the dimension to leave alone rather than the dimensions to compute the mean and std over
