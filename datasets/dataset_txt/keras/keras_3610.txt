Hi all,
I am trying to implement flexible regularization scheduler. Instantiate layer like this:
x = Convolution2D(... W_regularizer=l2(10)...)
and later change regularization:
model.layers[1].W_regularizer = l2(0)
I can verify the layer's settings changed:
model.layers[1].W_regularizer.l2
Out[9]: array(0.0, dtype=float32)
but this has no effect during following training whether I compile model anew or not. Where is a caveat?
