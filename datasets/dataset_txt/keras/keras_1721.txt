Thank you!
[Done ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:

Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I have a saved a model using model.save(). I'm trying to reload the model and add a few layers and tune some hyper-parameters, however, it throws the AttributeError.
Model is loaded using load_model().
I guess I'm missing understanding how to add layers to saved layers. If someone can guide me here, it will be great. I'm a novice to deep learning and using keras, so probably my request would be silly.
Snippet:
prev_model = load_model('final_model.h5') # loading the previously saved model.

prev_model.add(Dense(256,activation='relu'))
prev_model.add(Dropout(0.5))
prev_model.add(Dense(1,activation='sigmoid'))

model = Model(inputs=prev_model.input, outputs=prev_model(prev_model.output))
And the error it throws:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "image_classifier_3.py", line 39, in <module>
    prev_model.add(Dense(256,activation='relu'))
AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'add'
I know adding layers works on new Sequential() model, but how do we add to existing saved models?
Can you help @joelthchao @fchollet ?
