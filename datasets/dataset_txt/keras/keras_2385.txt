Hi!
I would like to add parallel_cells argument in LSTM (and maybe in other recurrent layers too). As said in the paper Going Wider: Recurrent Neural Network With Parallel Cells this can give us better results with a little effort. Do you think that adding such argument is a good idea? If yes then I will implement it in the next few days.
Best regards
