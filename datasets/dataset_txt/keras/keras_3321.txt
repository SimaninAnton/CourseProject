Hi,
Has anyone implemented in keras RNN hidden state transferring from deeper layers to shallower ones?
E.g., if H_{3, (t-1)} if the hidden state of the 3rd RNN layer and at time step t-1, transfer this state to layer 1 and time step t NOT as input (i.e. readout) but as hidden state (e.g. add it to the H_{1, (t-1)}).
Blocks framework has something similar in the examples, so it is doable from the Theano part.
