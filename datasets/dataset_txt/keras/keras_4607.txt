Is it possible to perform adaptive activations in Keras? See: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/showciting?cid=1882454
My understanding is that a set of neurons can serve as the weight-constants for a polynomial activation function.
I.e. Y = N1_x^2_+N2_x_+N3, where N is a neuron
The activation function changes as training progresses to better serve its task
