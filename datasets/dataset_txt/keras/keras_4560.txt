Dear all, I have been struggling to build an LSTM model with multiple(2) hidden layers of size: 512 with a fixed time step: 10 (subject to change). However, I only succeeded in building a single LSTM layer network whose performance was far poorer than my expectations. My model as of right now is as follows:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(512, input_shape(10,13))
model.add(Dense(1201))
As shown in the code, I am feeding 3D inputs of dim: (batch_size, time_step, input_dim) = (batch_size, 10, 13). Howe should I add another layer in this network? Keras documentation states that
model.add(LSTM(512))
should do as the model auto-detects the input shape to a hidden layer, but this gives the following error:
Exception: Input 0 is incompatible with layer lstm_2: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2
To clarify, I want each sequence of 10 inputs to output one label, instead of a sequence of 10 labels. Any guide to build this model would be much appreciated.
Thank you all very much for your help in advance!
