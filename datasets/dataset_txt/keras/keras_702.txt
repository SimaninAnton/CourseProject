Two types of RNN can be used:
Type1: The output is being used as state
h(t) = g(W1.x(t) + W2.h(t-1) + b1)
Type2: There is a state in addition to the output
a(t) = g(W1.x(t) + W2.a(t-1) + b1)
h(t) = g(W3.a(t) + b2)
I know both of them can be used, but I want to be sure which one is imlemented in keras. So, which of the above mathematical structure is implemented by SimpleRNN in keras? I tried looking at the documentation, but its unclear.
