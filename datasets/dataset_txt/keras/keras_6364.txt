Should it be part of official model API, and so part of documentation? If so, it might be worth clarifying when exactly the training stops, etc. Also, whether it's ok to set it in any of the callback methods (on_epoch_end, on_batch_end, etc.) or if there's a reason why it should only be done in certain methods.
