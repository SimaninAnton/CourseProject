I am working with @RobGrimm on a Hierarchical Softmax to speed up training with a large nb of classes. Would this be a welcome PR? It's only two-level right now, but that already gives a dramatic speed-up. The plain softmax is an Activation, but the Hierarchical version seems more of a core layer: what do you reckon?
