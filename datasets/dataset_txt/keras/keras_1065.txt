Seems like tests are timing out on Travis CI with tensorflow backend build on python2.7 and python3 for the last 4 days.
I saw that the last commit that was successfully built was 3b440235e237ef59ec5763c413e7f4292dab5d79 by @fchollet which appears to include changes in keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py.
Maybe it's time to change --durations=10 to --durations=20 in pytest.ini ?
