I've started experimenting a little bit with experiment visualization.
Here's a demo capable of monitoring a Keras experiment on a live-updating webpage: https://github.com/fchollet/hualos
What are your thoughts on what exactly we should be building? What do we need?
Here are some initial ideas:
typical workflow would require:
configure what you want to monitor and how via a callback constructor
be able to assign IDs to experiments and to monitor multiple experiments at the same time
monitoring capabilities would include:
loss and validation loss monitoring
accuracy and validation accuracy monitoring on a different scale
confusion matrix monitoring for classification tasks
layers weights monitoring
activations monitoring
