The TensorBoard callback never closes the log file. I've had a 12 hour run interupted by a max file descriptor error.
I suppose this:
    for name, value in logs.items():
        if name in ['batch', 'size']:
            continue
        summary = tf.Summary()
        summary_value = summary.value.add()
        summary_value.simple_value = value.item()
        summary_value.tag = name
        self.writer.add_summary(summary, epoch)
    self.writer.flush()
needs to be followed with:
self.writer.close()
based on the TF docs:
tf.train.SummaryWriter.close()
Flushes the event file to disk and close the file.
Call this method when you do not need the summary writer anymore.
@tboquet what do you think - I see it's your callback.
BTW it has been a total blessing to have such a convenient callback available. Thank you!
