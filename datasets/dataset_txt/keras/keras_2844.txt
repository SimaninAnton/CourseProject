Hi,everybody.I use keras in my project which is to predict the punctuation for chinese.
Firstly,i get some classed chinese corpus.
Secondly,i use a Python segment tool to cut the corpus.
Thirdly,i use a modified one hot encode function to replace chinese words with int number.
Then i use these date to train my lstm neural networks.
But finally when i try to check the result ,i find the evaluate() gave more high accuracy than predict_classes().
Can anyone help?
