Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
def normalize(arr):
    arr = arr.astype('float32')
    if arr.max() > 1.0:
        arr /= 255.0
    return arr

model = load_model('archeradam.h5')
directory = 'images/train/W'
aDir = os.listdir(directory)
for images in aDir:
    img = cv2.imread("{}/{}".format(directory, images), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    img = normalize(img)
    img = np.reshape(img, [1 ,231, 172, 1])
   print(model.predict_classes(img))
So for example, I'm using the model I loaded that I used to train on my train and validation folder.
Now, just to double check things, I'm running predict_classes and the output should all be the same, correct? Because the CNN should know that these are all from the class W because that's what I used to train it on
Except, when I run the script above the output I get it...

So I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong here?
