I have large number of models (of different structure) that were built using the same input shape (but not the same InputLayer object).
Is it possible to merge their input into one of the same dimension?
I know I can do
m = Model(inputs=[m.input for m in models], output=....
But this approach requires duplication the x variable in fit method. I would like to avoid this as the number of models is very large.
Thanks
