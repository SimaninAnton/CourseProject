I've been trying to improve containers lately, and I've run into a bunch of cases where the classes that need to override methods inherited from Layer are Graph, Sequential, and AutoEncoder. This actually make sense, since AutoEncoder also "contains" its encoder and decoder layers, and needs to pass changes down to them. Would there be any support for moving AutoEncoder into containers.py (with a suitable redirect/deprecation warning so as not to break existing code)?
