For various reasons, I want to suppress the per-epoch output that Model._fit() prints directly, but I still want a progress bar. I thought this would suffice:
model.fit(..., verbose=0, callbacks=[ keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger() ])
Unfortunately, _fit() initializes all of the callbacks with verbose, and ProgbarLogger produces no output at all if verbose is 0.
It seems to me that the latter is a bit odd, since the whole point of ProgbarLogger is to produce output. Does it make sense to remove the checks for verbose in ProgbarLogger?
Thanks.
