I'm attempting to create the Differentiable Neural Dictionary from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01988 in Keras
I'm creating a custom layer to act as the DND, however I need to pass data to this layer every run, specifically the key and Q-value. Unfortunately I've run into errors with this, is there any way to pass these values to my custom layer through some kind of function call?
It seems as though once the layer is created and compiled I can't modify or append any information to its data structures and using stateful isn't very helpful unfortunately since I need to pass data in from outside of the layer.
Any and all help is appreciated
