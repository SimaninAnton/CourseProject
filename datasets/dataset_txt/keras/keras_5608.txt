This issue is that Theano has broadcasting for matrix multiplication and Tensorflow does not.
So while T.dot and tf.matmul are the same when the inputs are 2D, Theano happily takes 3D inputs while Tensorflow does not.
This is the issue breaking maxout in tensorflow: #2149
This seems best resolved by forcing K.dot to only take 2D input and then using K.batch_dot for things like maxout. What do you all think?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
