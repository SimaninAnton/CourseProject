It is said in the document that keras will automatically run on GPU with tensorflow backend.
However, I found Keras depends on the installation order of tensorflow modules. It seems that keras always use the module installed last. For example,
pip install tensorflow-gpu tensorflow
Keras will use CPU under this circumenstance.
