I am running theano.__version__ = 0.9.0.dev-c697eeab84e5b8a74908da654b66ec9eca4f1291 and keras.__version__ = 2.0.2 on conda environment with Python 3.6.1. OS in Windows Server 2012 R2 with Graphics Card Nvidia Quadro K6000. Cuda 7.5 installed with Nvidia Driver 354.56.
model.evaluate() is not covering all data points. I have total 768 data points, but model.evaluate() is evaluating only 32 data points and give the accuracy of 75.52%. I also tried batch sizes of 100, 50, 20, 10 & 1, but it does not cover all the data points but the accuracy remains unchanged.
You can check my Jupyter Notebook file if the implementation here
I tried to discuss this on StackExchange, and I was suggested by experience people that it could be a bug in keras or the progress bar might have broken. I don't know how to check if the progress bar is broken, so I am posting the issue here.
