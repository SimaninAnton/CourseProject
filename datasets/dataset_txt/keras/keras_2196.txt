Hi,
I wanted to retrain the fully connected layers of VGG 16 for big gray level images.
So I've:
created a new VGG with a single color channel and loaded the weights from of the original VGG.
add trainable=False to all the convolution layers
reduced the number of neurons in the dense layers in order to match my problem
increase drastically the max pooling dimensions and strides because I work with inputs 1800x1800 (no choice). But the dimensions drop very quickly to match the original VGG dimensions.
But when I start the training, I face a CNMEM_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY error.
I've tried to delete all the dense layers to keep only the output layers with two neurons, but stil the same problem.
Any idea how to fix it?
