Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hello everyone, I have been using this script Python script
The problem is that I am unable to produce similar result everytime.
Sometimes, I can produce a similar result (loss of 0.3~ within 500 epochs) but sometimes I still get a loss of 3.x after 1500epochs. I am not sure if this is a bug or this is because the algorithm just stuck at a minimum local.
