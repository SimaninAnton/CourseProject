@fchollet I came across something to make life better. There are a handful of tools out there to automatically close issues if they have been abandoned. Here is one example but there are plenty of options.
https://github.com/twbs/no-carrier
A configuration like this might be reasonable:
Send a warning at 2, 4 and 6 weeks.
Close after no activity for 8 weeks (other than the warnings), making sure to mark the resolution as something like "automatic closure" so it doesn't get confused with things that are manually closed. It would be easy to browse the automatic closures if you wanted to.
If something gets closed by accident, someone could always reopen it
Make some exceptions for any issues you want to pin and keep active.
There are currently 1,945 issues (not including this one) and rising. Does this sound like something reasonable to implement?
Cheers
