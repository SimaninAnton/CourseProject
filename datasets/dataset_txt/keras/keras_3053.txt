In the paper of fully convolutional neural network,
the authors mention both patch wise training and fully convolutional training.
I did not find the exact description of patch wise training.
My understanding is this:
Given an M*M image, extract sub-images with N*N, where (N<M). The selected sub-images are overlapped with eath other.
For each batch, it can include all the sub-images for a given image or multiple images.
Is my understanding correct? Then what are the difference between patch-wise and fully convolutional training?
In Keras, how can we ensure the sub-images belonging to the same image to included in a single batch?
