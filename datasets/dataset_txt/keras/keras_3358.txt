Hi,
I've created my own ImageDataGenerator.
It reads images from two directories (one per class), and if the batch size is N, then each batch will contain N/2 images of each class.
And if there are M images per class, so the sample per epoch must be samples_per_epoch=2*M/N.
I did a little test:
5000 images per class
batch of size 32
3 epochs
=> samples_per_epoch = 312.
But I get this warning:
UserWarning: Epoch comprised more than samples_per_epoch samples, which might affect learning results. Set samples_per_epoch correctly to avoid this warning.
Why?
Moreover,
But when I do the training, fit_generator displays:
Epoch 2/3
320/312 [==============================] - 0s - loss: 0.7812
Why do I get 320/312?
Thanks for your help.
