So i have read issue #40 and i understand that theano's matrix's have to have the same dimensions.
I have Keras padding my sequences and that works. My data is just list of texts documents, its usually between 100 to 50k characters per document. I end up padding some documents with 49900 zeros (if text document is 100 characters long). I have a classification problem btw.
I switched to a Convolutional neural network because using a regular neural network with a few dense layers got way to slow when i increased the input sizes above 10k, also i thought the cnn would be able to notice that some documents have a ton of zeros, ignore that data and focus on the actual non-zero characters. Is my theory wrong?
Then the max pool would reduce the # of zeros even more.
I guess this is a sort of a feature request, i'm not sure how Keras deals with padding when its doing it thing but would it be possible for Keras to recognize the zeros and skip them?
Should i maybe using a different kind of neural network?
Thanks for any help
