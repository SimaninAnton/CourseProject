Hi All,
I try to add a new merge mode. Therefore, I modified Merge class.
At the beginning, I installed keras with "sudo python setup.py install" command.
So after I modified the source code. I run "sudo python setup.py install" again. However, I seems it doesn't work. And throw below exception.
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.11-intel/egg/keras/layers/containers.py", line 33, in add
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.11-intel/egg/keras/layers/core.py", line 34, in set_previous
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
I am not sure it is a installation problem or modify Merge class problem.
Thanks
