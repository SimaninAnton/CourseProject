Does anyone have an idea of how a NaN can rise in the prediction array, that is in the return value of predict() method? I check the data with which I'm feeding my net, but everything seems to be fine.
If it can be helpful I'm training a recurrent net with some (2 to 4) GRU layers and a TimeDistributedDense layer at the end to perform a multi-class classification task.
