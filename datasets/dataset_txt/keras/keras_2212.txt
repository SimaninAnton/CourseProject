Hi,
I have a model that classifies RGB images and it works well.
Now, I would like to use the same model on gray level images without re-training the new model. I could duplicate the gray level image in order to give it three identical channels, but it would use a excessive memory.
So I would like to load the RGB model and get only the weights of a single channel (green for example) that I would affect to my gray level model.
Any idea how I can access the weights of a given channel?
Regards,
