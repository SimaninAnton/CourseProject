i am using keras 1.2 and running the following simple code on the cpu with tensorflow backend (0.12).
K.clear_session() does not clear the memory completely and there is a serious memory leak.
any ideas how to solve it ?
import keras.models
import keras.backend as K
for i in range(300):
try:
model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.hdf5')
K.clear_session()
except Exception as e:
print(e)
break
