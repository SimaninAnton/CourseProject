If I try to use a list of weights it gives a error:
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'
If I try to use a 1D array, it gives the error:
ValueError: Found a sample_weight array with shape (17,) for an input with shape (180, 17). sample_weight cannot be broadcast.
model.evaluate(X, Y, batch_size=50, sample_weight=weights)
