In model.py, standardize_X converts X into a list for some reason I was not able to find in the code. Since all that should be needed is to get slices from X, why is that necessary? If one implements an alternative data structure that has the same API as numpy.ndarray, nothing should break. slice_X, for example, supports both list and non-list arguments, as long as they support slicing. standardize_X currently breaks the HDF5Dataset interface (and some of my personal code as well).
