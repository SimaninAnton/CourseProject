I have a relatively large multi-layer regression model that I want to train end-to-end. My training is a two-step procedure in which I first minimize the euclidean loss and then I minimize my loss. Effectively, this means the following pseudo-code:
model.compile(optimizer='Adam', loss='mse')
model.fit()
model.compile(optimizer='Adam', loss=my_metric)
model.fit()
I am able to run the first two statements without any problems. But I get an out of memory error when my code reaches the second model.compile statement. What should I do differently to avoid this problem ?
