I was training a neural network, somehow, during my training, the loss and val_loss values remains the same.
Epoch 1/5 52/51 [==============================] - 1423s - loss: 1.0097 - val_loss: 1.0082 Epoch 2/5 52/51 [==============================] - 1417s - loss: 1.0097 - val_loss: 1.0082 Epoch 3/5 52/51 [==============================] - 1417s - loss: 1.0097 - val_loss: 1.0082
Here is my mode compile and fit_generator code, is there anything I missed?
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
train_steps = len(train)/NUM_BATCH
valid_steps = len(valid)/NUM_BATCH
metrics = model.fit_generator(train_gen, steps_per_epoch=train_steps,
validation_data=valid_gen,validation_steps=valid_steps, epochs=EPOCHS, verbose=1)
