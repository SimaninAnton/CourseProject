Hi
I'm working from a Kaggle Notebook and I want to change the metric to monitor during ReduceLRonPlateau by another one (F1 score).
It seems the function is identifying properly the 'val_f1_metric' to monitor (look how the metric is reduced from inf to val_f1_metric after the first epoch) But, in the next epochs, the improvement of the metric is not identified:
I have the intuition taht, after the first epoch, the evaluation is being done on 'val_loss' instead of on 'val_f1_metric'.
The change of monitor is written like this:
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_f1_metric', factor=0.5, patience=1, min_lr=0.0001, verbose=2)
Please let me know if there is something written wrong.
Thanks for the help
