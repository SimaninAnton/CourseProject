Never mind: I see there was a recent pull request that resolved this issue.
I am using Keras version 1.0.5 with Python3. Using the variational autoencoder example found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/examples/variational_autoencoder.py
I obtain the error:
Exception: Thecompute_maskmethod of layer "lambda_1" should return one mask tensor per output tensor of the layer. Found: [None, None]
I am sure there is an easy fix for this error, but it would be good to out out-of-the-box functioning examples. I've ensured that this behavior is the same across both the Theano and Tensorflow backends.
