My filter is described as follows:
The current filter is a window, sliding from the start to the end.
I need to separate the filter into two, and they slide together.
Here, I have three similar filters, with different steps for each of them.
I looked into the source code of keras Conv2d, it basically uses theano.tensor.nnet.conv2d.
In class ConvOp, it defines the filter shape as a turple of (the number of samples, the number of filters, filter_row, filter_col).
Will it causes error if I add an index (to describe the steps between the two parts of filter) in this shape?
Also, I think I need to revise the C-code which is used to do convolution computation.
Anyone has any good ideas?
Thank you so much!!
