Hi. I am trying to make a few changes to the Recurrent class so that if the input_length is provided, the RNN will be unrolled. Pseudo code:
X = input
X = K.permute_dimensions(X, (1, 0, 2))
input_length  = self.input_shape[1]
outputs = []
states = bla bla bla
for i in range(input_length):
    x = X[i]
    y, states = self.step(x, states)
    outputs.append(y)
if self.return_sequences:
     #TODO
else:
     return outputs[-1]
If return_sequences = True, how do I convert the outputs, which is a list of 2D tensors, to a 3D tensor? Should be using the Kears backend functions.. no theano code. Thanks.
