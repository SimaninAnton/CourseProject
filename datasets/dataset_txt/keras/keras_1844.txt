Bit new to RNNs so bear with me...
I want to create an RNN layer (LSTM maybe?) in between two dense layers, but I'm having issues with the correct ndims.
ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer lstm_1: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2
This issue #915 suggested to use embedding or TimeDistributedDense layers, but embedding layers can only be used as the first layer (https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) and I cannot find any documentation on TimeDistributed Dense. So I'm not sure how this would work...Suggestions?
