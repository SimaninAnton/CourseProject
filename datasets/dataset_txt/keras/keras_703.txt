Other datasets under the package keras.datasets has a load_data function which has a ·path· parameter. The fashion mnist dataset is the only special case . This is inconsistent.
So I think the better way is to give freedom to users to config where to put the downloaded data .
this is the reuter datasets use case:
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = reuters.load_data("/data/reuters.npz",num_words=max_words,test_split=0.2)
fashion mnist is different from other dataset, it's very ugly.
And I cannot think up why don't give freedom to users.
this is the fashion mnist code:
def load_data():
    """Loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

    # Returns
        Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.
    """
    dirname = os.path.join('datasets', 'fashion-mnist')
    base = 'http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/'
    files = ['train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz', 'train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
             't10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz', 't10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz']
