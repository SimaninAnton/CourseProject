I built a very simple model to learn keras, while I am in trouble now. The loss returned by keras is small (about 2), which is different form what I expected.
I implemented this modle with pure theano, and the loos is about 4000.
I wonder if the keras preprocess the data in certain way by default, such as normalization. Thank your very much.
    model = Sequential()

    model.add(Dense(n_in, n_hidden, init='lecun_uniform'))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(dropout))

    model.add(Dense(n_hidden, n_out, init='lecun_uniform'))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))

    sgd = SGD(lr=0.1, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=sgd)
