After using LSTM, I thought each of the time steps in a RNN input has identical length.
For example, I have an input vector I with length n.
Thus,
I[0:3] belong to time step 1;
I[3:6] belong to time step 2;
etc.
However, what if I want each time step has different length?
Like
I[0:4] belong to time step 1;
I[4:6] belong to time step 2;
I[6:15] belong to time step 3;
etc.
Should I write a new RNN layer to implement such function?
