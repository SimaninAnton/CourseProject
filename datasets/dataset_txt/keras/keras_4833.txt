Hello,
I am using a graph model with one input and multiple outputs and I want to access epoch number inside a custom loss function :
def alphabinary(alpha):
def binary_cross(y_true, y_pred):
return alpha * K.mean(K.binary_crossentropy(y_pred, y_true), axis=-1)
return binary_cross
My objective is to make the "alpha" parameter into alpha(epoch).
I was able to do it outside the loss by recompiling but my code is kinda ugly so I am looking for a better way.
(PS: My graph model is doing target replication : Deeply-Supervised Nets )
Thank you very much for your help and have a nice day !
