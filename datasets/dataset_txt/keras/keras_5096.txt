Just want to put this here for others who may be googling
I ran into significant trouble trying to add a Dense layer after an LSTM. Turns out I was selecting my dimensions from a numpy array instead of a list. Once I converted my numNeurons numpy array to a list I was able to add the model correctly. Had to do the same for my dropouts array as well.
