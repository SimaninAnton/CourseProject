Some comments after viewing the code in keras/keras/preprocessing/image.py:
There is an option to set fit(augment=True), which does not seem to do anything. It works a lot on creating a copy of the whole dataset X where every image is transformed, and then ignores that X.
flow() applies all the transformations through random_transform(), on an image with dimensions (Depth, Height, Width). On the other hand, fit(augment=True) applies the same transformations on an image with dimensions (Height, Width, Depth), by applying the helper function array_to_img() first. As a result the transformations in the fit(augment=True) case don't really do what they are supposed to do.
So it seems that the fit(augment=True) case is no longer working properly, and should probably be removed (or fixed).
