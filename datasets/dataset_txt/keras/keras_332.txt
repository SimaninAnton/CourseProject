Running a model with 9 inputs and 9 outputs on Keras Functional API.
The model fits just fine, but I'm getting this error when I'm running
model.predict
This is my fit function:
history = model.fit(x=[train1,train2,train3,train4,train5,train6,train7,train8,train9], 
          y=[y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6,y7,y8,y9], callbacks=callbacks,
          batch_size=40, epochs=50, verbose=1, validation_split=0.1, shuffle=False)
It runs perfectly, and I can even plot the history.
Then I'm running:
model.predict(train1[1],train1[2],train1[3],train1[4],train1[5],train1[6],train1[7],train1[8],train1[9])
And getting the error:
TypeError: predict() takes from 2 to 5 positional arguments but 10 were given
I checked that the shape of each input is similar to what the model can accept (each train1[x] has the same shape)
I tried running
model.predict([train1[1],train1[2],train1[3],train1[4],train1[5],train1[6],train1[7],train1[8],train1[9]])
And got the following error:
ValueError: Error when checking input: expected input_1 to have shape (9216,) but got array with shape (1,)
I also tried running:
model.predict(train1[1:9])
And got
ValueError: Error when checking model input: the list of Numpy arrays that you are passing to your model is not the size the model expected. Expected to see 9 array(s), but instead got the following list of 8 arrays: [array([[255.]... â€“
I also tried running
model.predict(train1[1:10])
And got
ValueError: Error when checking input: expected input_1 to have shape (9216,) but got array with shape (1,)
