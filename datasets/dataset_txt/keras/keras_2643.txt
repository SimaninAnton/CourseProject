Hi,
I'm using stateful RNN model with custom callback which resets state between batches on training. I want to use the same callback when predicting with this model. (Each batch in my dataset is a separate sequence.) Can I do this using callbacks, or my only option is to run a loop with predict_batch and reset_state on each iteration?
Thanks :)
