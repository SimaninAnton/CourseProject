In my keras installation, I can see the backend configuration as
cat $HOME/.keras/keras.json
{"floatx": "float32", "epsilon": 1e-07, "backend": "theano","image_dim_ordering": "th"}
In this vgg16.py, author uses
data_format=K.image_data_format() Are they the same thing? Can I just replace image_data_format with image_data_ordering?
