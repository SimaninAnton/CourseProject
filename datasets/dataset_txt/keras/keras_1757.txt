Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
from keras import backend as K
tensor = K.one_hot(indices=3, num_classes=5)
The shape of this tensor is (1, 5). However Keras requires the shape to be (None, 1, 5) during the LSTM training process and throws this error
ValueError: Error when checking input: expected lstm_1_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (1, 5)
I traced down to the training.py, and I found the expected shape is (None, 1, 5).
I tried to use K.zeros(shape=(None, 1, 5)) to define the tensor, but I can't update the value at a specific index from 0 to 1.
Is there any way to make the one-hot array the correct shape? Thanks!
