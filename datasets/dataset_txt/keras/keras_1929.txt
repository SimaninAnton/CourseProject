Hi, dear all,
I am implementing a custom LSTM layer based on the original version. I don't use stateful LSTM. I see in the "step" function, there is the variable "states" which seems to store some internal information, like the previous c and h. Is this the one for every step or only for the stateful LSTM use(e.g. memorize the last step in previous sequence)?
Also, there is a self.states variable in the class. Could anyone tell me if this is for state of every step or only for stateful LSTM?
Thank you very much!
