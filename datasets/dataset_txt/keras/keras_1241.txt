Hi,
I just upgrade my Keras to latest version and getting a error related to keras/engine/training on the code that used to work fine beforehand (my previous version was 2.1.0). I am not sure if it's some kind of deprectation or etc.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "template_model_1.py", line 118, in <module>
    acc, ll = test_MC_dropout(test_model, X_test, Y_test)
  File "/data/home/shekoofeh/Project/Dropout-BB/BBalpha-TeUS/BBalpha_dropout.py", line 72, in test_MC_dropout
    pred = model.predict(X, verbose=1)  # N x K x D
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1842, in predict
    verbose=verbose, steps=steps)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1292, in _predict_loop
    stateful_metrics=self.stateful_metric_names)
AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'stateful_metric_names'
It's happening on a brach of Dropout + BB-alpha for detecting adversarial examples. Unfortunately, I coudn't share my own version due to disclusure of the project. Thanks for being understanding.
I found Add Stateful (Global) Metrics #9200, but I couldn't track down changes. Any idea how to solve the issue?
Thanks,
Shek
