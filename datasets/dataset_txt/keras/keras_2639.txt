Hello,
I am trying to merge two layers using the functional API. Now my output shape from one layer is not the same as the output shape from the other layer. How may I go about downsampling or compressing the one with the higher image dimension?
eg -
downsample=(Merge(layerone,layersix],mode='concat')
layerthree=Convolution2D(128, 3, 3,activation='relu')(downsample)
