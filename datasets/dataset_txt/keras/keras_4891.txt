I would like to know if users and developers of Keras would be interested in having a graphical gallery of examples for Keras, like the ones of matplotlib, scikit-learn or scikit-image (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html and http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/).
Thanks to the new sphinx-gallery package, it is now quite easy to build a gallery for a project that already has scripts for examples, as Keras does.
If there is sufficient interest, I could give a hand with the gallery.
