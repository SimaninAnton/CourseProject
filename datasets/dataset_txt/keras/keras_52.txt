Hi Keras Team,
At https://keras.io/applications/ , there are some model weights (Xception, ResNet) released under the MIT License. Although these models were trained on Imagenet, which can only be used for research and non-commercial usage. Does it mean we can use these model weights in commercial applications? does it conflict with Imagenet data's non-commercial license? since the model weight is a derivative of the imagenet data. Hope this is the right place to ask.
Best Regards,
