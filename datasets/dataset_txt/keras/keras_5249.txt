I have tried to experiment with AveragePooling and it reverts back to CPU and my whole graph training becomes insanely slower.
I searched for similar issues and found this old issue on Theano: Theano/Theano#2792
They seem to suggest that one should use MaxPooling with some weird argument or use the cudnn sandbox from theano. How is the keras averagepooling with Theano backend implemented?
Could somebody confirm that the use of averagepooling reverts back to CPU execution with Theano backend?
