Hi,
I am trying to change loss weight during training. When i check source code, loss weight is set during compiling. When i call fit, compile process is over. Is there any easy way to accomplish this target easily. I saw some issues related with learning rate but changing code "as in learning rate example" can affect other parts.
As i have limited experience on theano and keras, I need your help. Thanks (keras version 1.1.1)
