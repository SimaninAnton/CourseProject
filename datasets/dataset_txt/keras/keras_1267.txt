Hi,
I have two questions regarding the following: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_siamese.py
In the function euclidean_distance why do you use K.epislon? Because you are doing a square of a difference. The result will always be positive.
In the paper that you cite, the labels are 0 when the two images are similar and 1 when they are dissimilar. The values of the loss function are not the same when you change that (in your case y=1 denotes similar images).
Thank you so much! Any help would be appreciated.
