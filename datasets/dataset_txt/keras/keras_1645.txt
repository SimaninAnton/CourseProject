Hi, I am using lstm layer with return sequences = True, say:
x = LSTM(32, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim))(inp)
And I would expect the output shape to be : (None(batch size), timesteps, 32(units)),
In my case it is (?, 8, 32)
but what I got is :Tensor("lstm_1/transpose_1:0", shape=(?, ?, 32), dtype=float32)
I wonder why it returns another None dimension? It dose not influence the model compiling but when trying to implement some more complicated models it cause troubles.
Or is there anything I misunderstood?
Thanks very much for your help!
