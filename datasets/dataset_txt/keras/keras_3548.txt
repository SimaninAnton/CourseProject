In keras/keras/layers/convolutional.py line 399 (and probably other places) add_weight does not get self.trainable as input.
In keras/keras/engine/topology.py line 400 (add_weight) trainable thus defaults to True, which results in weights 'disappearing' for non-trainable layers (add weight calls self._trainable_weights.append(weight), after which self._trainable_weights looks at self.trainable, sees that's false, and returns [])
