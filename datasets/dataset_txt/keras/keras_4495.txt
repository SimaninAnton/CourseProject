I have an implementation of minibatch discrimination as described in this paper in the form of a Keras layer. It helps prevent GANs from collapsing to a single output, as outlined in the paper. Once I get around to adding documentation and tests, I can get a PR ready and outline the API, if this is something you're interested in adding. Let me know if this is too specialized of a layer.
