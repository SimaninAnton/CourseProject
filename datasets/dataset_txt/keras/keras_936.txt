Hello, I'am new to NLP, thanks for your introduction to seq2seq.
I can't figure out why decoder_target_data should ahead of decoder_input_data by one timestep, in the code(line 116 - 112), a char in target_text will set decoder_input_data'value twice when t > 0.
In my opinion, line 118 should be removed.
Looking forward for your reply.
Thanks!
