I am trying to translate a Theano code into Keras code
The problem is the line 22 of the code:
    freqs = K.equal(val2[:,None], val2[None,:]).sum(0).astype("float32")
that return me
ValueError: ('You cannot drop a non-broadcastable dimension.', ((False, False), (0, 'x')))
The code logic works perfect in Theano. I can't figure out where is the problem.
