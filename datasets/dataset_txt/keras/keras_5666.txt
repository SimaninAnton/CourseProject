I initially thought this was a theano issue but I am not sure now. Problem is the following wickedly tricky theano message.
TypeError: ('An update must have the same type as the original shared variable (shared_var=    <TensorType(float32, matrix)>, shared_var.type=TensorType(float32, matrix),     update_val=Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, update_val.type=TensorType(float64, matrix)).', 'If the   difference is related to the broadcast pattern, you can call the tensor.unbroadcast(var, axis_to_unbroadcast[, ...]) function to remove broadcastable dimensions.')
Following line triggers the issue:
model.compile(optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True),loss='mse')
before going into theano, problem comes up in models.py
file "C:\Users\xxxx\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\keras\models.py", line 515, in compile
self._train = K.function(train_ins, [train_loss], updates=updates)
Any hints?
