I am training MLP using GPU mode. The loss value keeps increasing and accuracy is extremely low (~9%). However, when I switch to CPU mode, everything is fine (loss decreases and accuracy increases ~95%).
There shouldn't be problem with Theano, as training using theano MLP codes in GPU mode is working fine. I'm using CUDA 7.0 and Theano 0.7.0.
Anyone has the same issue?
