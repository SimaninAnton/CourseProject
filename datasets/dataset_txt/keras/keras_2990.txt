I run the Keras with Tensorflow GPU backend.
I run two programs in two Jupyter notebooks. I tried to run two programs one after another without shutting down any notebooks, the PC stop running, thus I have to restart PC.
If I shutdown 1st notebook and run the other one, it won't have the same problem.
I tried the following code to release memory, but the problem is still there unless I shutdown the notebook.
from keras import backend as K K.clear_session()
So two questions:
Is that due to unstable status of Windows?
How to clean the memory of both Keras and Tensorflow? It seems both parameters and models take a lot of memories.
