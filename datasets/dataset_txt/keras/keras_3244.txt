In this link, devinplatt gives the following way to include dropout in training,
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dropout(0.5, input_shape=(20,)))
model.add(Dense(64, init='uniform'))
In this post, author mentioned that “Finally, if the training has finished, you’d use the complete network for testing (or in other words, you set the dropout probability to 0).”
In terms of keras implementation, does that mean, we have to modify the line model.add(Dropout(0.5, input_shape=(20,))) after we loading the training weight.
