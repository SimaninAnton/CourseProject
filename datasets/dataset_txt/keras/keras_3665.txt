Hi guys. I am trying to augment my image data. However, my labels are also images. So i need to do the same augmentation operations on both image and label. I would like to save both as image but somehow, when I use datagen.flow, it does not save the label, only the image. I also insert the code I am using:
https://github.com/adkoadko/ostruvky/blob/master/Keras_augmentation
Is there a way to save also the label? Or have I missed something?
Thank you
