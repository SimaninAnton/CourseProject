Hello!
I am currently train a network in Keras, but when i look in nvidia-smi the Volatile Gpu Utils is around 50%. No matter how hard i try, i cannot pass that limit. On the other hand, using Tensorflow on the same model, with the same parameters and everything, i reach 100%. The problem is that in Tensorflow the training is faster with around 50%, so i don't think that those numbers are "errors" provided by nvidia-smi. What could be the problem?
