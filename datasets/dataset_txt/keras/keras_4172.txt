Hi,
i am new to keras and have a question it would be great if someone could help or at least give me some suggestions if my idea is stupid :) I am using keras with Tensorflow.
I would like to build a supervised learning network. I have a .csv-file with data, in each row i have three input floats and one output float. The idea is to get the output float out of the three input floats. I have no classification for the output floats, they are in a range from about -50.00 to 50.00.
The network should react on the inputs so that that the results comme closer to the output. Thank you in forward for every idea.
