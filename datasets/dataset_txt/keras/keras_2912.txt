Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
The imageDataGenerator calls e.g., NumpyArrayIterator, which calls the array_to_img that has set the 'scale' default to true. I wonder if this can be changed to a parameter for imageDataGenerator, the reason being a lot of images, e.g., medical images, should not be scaled to [0, 255] as the natural jpeg images.
