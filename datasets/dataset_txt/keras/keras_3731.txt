Hi!
I`m using the example in https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html to generate more images for each one in my dataset, but I am getting the following error:
IndexError Traceback (most recent call last)
< ipython-input-14-2d81fc849a89 > in < module >()
18 i = 0
19 for batch in datagen.flow(x, batch_size=1,
---> 20 save_to_dir='images/train/1', save_prefix='cat', save_format='jpeg'):
21 i += 1
22 if i > 20:
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/preprocessing/image.pyc in next(self)
579 if self.y is None:
580 return batch_x
--> 581 batch_y = self.y[index_array]
582 return batch_x, batch_y
583
IndexError: too many indices for array
The code is the same, with different paths. :(
