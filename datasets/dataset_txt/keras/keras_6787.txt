I'm running the cifar_cnn example. I'm not using data_augmentation (changed the flag to False) and also I'm only training for 10 epochs.
After 10 epochs, I'm computing the loss on the train using the evaluate function of the method. The loss printed by the fit function at the end of the 10th epoch is much higher than the error on train when using evaluate.
Can someone please help me to understand what's wrong?
Thank you!
