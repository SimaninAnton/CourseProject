I know that if we use the by_name=True option in model.load_weights, it load the weights for the layers with matching name as the saved model. Obviously, my current architecture and saved architecture is not quite the same but share similar layers.
The issue I am running into, is that I can't figure out which layers have their weights reloaded, and I also can't figure out an easy manner to "check" that the loaded weights are correct. This is important because if I accidentally made a typo in my new architecture, an internal check that tells me which layers have reloaded weights, would be a very helpful sanity check.
I know how to print out all of the weights:
for layer in model.layers:
    weights = layer.get_weights()
But that prints out everything. I also tried summing the entire list of weights, but that doesn't always work (depends on the layer type).
