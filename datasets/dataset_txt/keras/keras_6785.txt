Hello All,
I met the same error which is shown "ValueError: new_order[2] is 2, but the input only has 2 axes." when I want to add a LSTM in my model. In addition, I also added "return_sequences=True" in my code, but the error still comes..
Here is my code:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution2D(100, 1, 2, 5, border_mode='valid'))
model.add(Activation('tanh'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(49600,peptidemaxLen, init='normal'))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.add(LSTM(peptidemaxLen, peptidemaxLen, return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
Before adding LSTM layer, the code can be run successfully. However, the error comes after adding the LSTM layer.
Could any of you can help me solve this problem? I am very appreciated for your great help!
