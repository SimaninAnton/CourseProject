I try to plot mode using this code
plot_model('model_architecture.jpg', model)
But I'm getting this error
    dot = model_to_dot(model, show_shapes, show_layer_names, rankdir)
  File "/home/semanticslab20/anaconda3/envs/ctc/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keras/utils/vis_utils.py", line 64, in model_to_dot
    layers = model.layers
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'layers'
If I use model.summary(), It perfectly print model summary but plot model is not working. What could be possible cause.
Thanks
