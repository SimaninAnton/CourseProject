How exactly is Dropout handled in Keras? I can see in the code that inputs are multiplied with matrices that set some inputs equal to zero which makes a lot of sense. Dropout also requires scaling down the final weights of the trained model depending on what dropout fraction was used. Where exactly does this happen?
