Hello,
Is there a way of setting some filters of a layer to zero and freezing them or just throwing away some filters for filter pruning purpose? The most intuitive way of doing it is to build a new model and then load the weights every time the filters are pruned. I was wondering if there is an easier way of doing it in Keras.
