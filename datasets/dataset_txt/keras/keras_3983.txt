By looking through the code i understood keras has one memor cell default in its architecture and it has an option for giving the number of blocks but the cell is fixed. But i would like to increase it in to four cells. It means each block should contain 4 blocks.
now if i use LSTM (4) - it contains 4 blocks and 4 cells
But i would need
LSTM(4) - 4 blocks and each block should contain 4 cells
