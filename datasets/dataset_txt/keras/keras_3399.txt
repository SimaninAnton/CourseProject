I've a video and a set of classes attached to it, there are multiple labels for each video. And I want to train a model to predict multiclass labels given a video.
What would be the way to train a multiclass label model for video using LSTM ?
Could anyone please suggest a method to tackle this problem ?
Thanks in advance.
