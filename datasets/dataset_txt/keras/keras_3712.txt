@farizrahman4u @fchollet I saw the issue once before, but there was no explanation there (#1478). you only mentioned that it would be better to utilize your own model in example folder...
when you create keras model (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py), and increase the batch_size from 32 to 128, the acc when running the example is decreasing or fixed after a while regradless of the number of convolution layers you used...
could you please explain what's the issue here?
