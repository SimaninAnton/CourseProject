I am working on multi label image classification problem. The dataset is given on this link. I am using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with fully connected neural network (NN) at the end. I am using the keras package for the same. My question is how can I proceed to complete this task. Is there any specific method for this?
Right now I have implemented the CNN with NN and I am using sigmoid as activation function at the end and loss as binary crossentropy. And after testing on test set I am getting probabilities for different labels and by using different thresholds for each label I am converting them into zeros and ones and checking Matthews Correlation Coeficient (MCC) for each label separately.
Is my approach right or wrong?
