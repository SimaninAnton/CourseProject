I have a very large audio dataset with 300hr of data.
There is a 'Data' folder with multiple sub-folders, and a text file specifying train-test-validation protocol.
I need help with data_generator function so that I can read a batch of wave files process them and pass them to keras .fit() function for model training.
I am new to python, so any help will be appreciated.
Thanks
