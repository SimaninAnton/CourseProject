Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Ubuntu 16.04 TF 1.1.0 pip installed Linux GPU 64 bit version using the embedded Keras api and the Keras shipping in TF 1.1.0
Models work fine when not using the validation split parameters of the fit method, Ie evaluate separately..
Using model.fit(x4,y,epochs=100, batch_size=200000,validation_data=(xe4,ye),verbose=1,callbacks=[TBcall,history])
Or model.fit(x4,y,epochs=100, batch_size=200000,validation_split=.33,verbose=1,callbacks=[TBcall,history])
Both result in a traceback: Key element being:
1050 except KeyError:
1051 pass
