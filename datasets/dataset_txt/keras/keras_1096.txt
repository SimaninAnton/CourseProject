Hi
I write a loop to train a reinforcement learning model, it is like the followings:
for e in range(episodes):
model.fit(X1, np_Y, epochs=1)
because the action memory need to be generated every loop, so the "fit" function must be called once every time.
I want to print the loss curve with Tensorboard show the whole process, so I call a keras.callbacks.TensorBoard. And put it in fitting, like:model.fit(X1, np_Y, epochs=1, callbacks=[TensorBoard])
But it generate a new log file every times I call "fit". So it can't draw a curve in Tensorboard when I use tensorboard --logdir=/log_dir.
Please help me how to draw a loss curve show the whole process of all the times of the model fitting?
Thank you!
