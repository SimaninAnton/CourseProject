Hello all!
I am trying to train a CNN (VGG-Face if wondering) and afterwards put a LSTM layer to do an analysis overtime. My doubt is how do I organize my input dataset. I have for example 10 videos and in each video we have 50 frames each frame is 224x224 with 3 channels RGB so I suppose the input of my network should be (10,50,224,224,3) where 50 is the time-step for the LSTM. Now my question is load every frame to a numpy array where I have (500,224,224,3) (10x50 = 500). How do I reshape this vector to be the desired one? I have tried a simple reshape but it seems it is not working. Am I doing something wrong?
How can I associate each frame(1 to 50) belonging to a specific video (1 to 10) and how can the LSTM understand that?
