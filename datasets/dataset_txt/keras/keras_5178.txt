Does anyone have any ideas as to why the validation accuracy curve would be this noisy?
For completeness, I'll mention that the "validation set" is systematically different than the training set (this is a transfer learning situation). I can provide more details as needed about the specific application and model, but was interested if there was some kind of generic explanation for the noisy accuracy curve.
