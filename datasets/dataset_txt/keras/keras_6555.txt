Hello,
I'm trying to get the loss & accuracy & weights automatically outputed to 2 files after each epoch, but I'm having some troubles.
for weights
I tried the checkpoints example described here:
http://keras.io/callbacks/#example-model-checkpoints
But I got the following issue:
Can save best model only with val_loss available, skipping.
warnings.warn("Can save best model only with %s available, skipping." % (self.monitor), RuntimeWarning)
To get the loss & accuracy, I created a new Callback with an on_batch_end(self, batch, logs={}) method.
But that function was only returning blank dict for logs.
Right now, I was thinking to change the generic_utils.progbar.update to output the data from here, but if you can think of a cleaner way that would be cool.
Thank you very much
