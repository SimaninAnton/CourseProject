I'm converting student-teacher model in below url to keras one.
https://github.com/chengshengchan/model_compression/blob/master/teacher-student.py
How can I give input to two model(student, teacher) and get one output from only student in keras? I'll set teacher's all tensors with trainable=false, and loss function as difference between student and teacher's output like below :
tf_loss = tf.nn.l2_loss(teacher - student)/batch_size
As I know, it is possible to give input to only one model when defining model.fit. But in this cases, I should it to both of teacher and student model.
Thank in advance!
