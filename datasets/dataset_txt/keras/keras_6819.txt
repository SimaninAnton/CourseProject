I have a 2D array consisting of time (nsecs), latitude, longitude and velocity as features which should be the input to simpleRNN. Its shape is (33336,4) as (nb_samples, input_dim). But there's a 3D array (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim) needed. Of course, I could simply use numpy.expand_dims() but then I would have something like (33336,1,4). But my time features are representing those timesteps. So now I'm confused how to actually create a decent 3D array with latitude, longitude and velocity and the time feature as required timesteps. I tried out different things like first creating a 3D array and then adding the data where its needed. But then I get some memory errors because of its size. Have you guys any ideas how I could create a reasonable input?
