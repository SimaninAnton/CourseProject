I am going through "Building Autoencoders in Keras" provided by @fchollet . When I want to reproduce the code of Convolutional autoencoder, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0rc0'
It looks like callbacks.py is failing to parse the version of tensorflow?
My version of Keras and TensorFlow is 1.0.3 and 0.8.0rc0, respectively.
