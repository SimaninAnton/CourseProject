I search a result from stackoverflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33474424/keras-load-weights-of-a-neural-network-error-when-predicting
it says you must compile before predict,but in my current keras version,I remove the compile code block,and then also get a good predict result.
from my opinion,when we predict ,we just do forward-propogation rather than back-propogation,so we dont need know what the loss is and how the loss is comprised of.so for a better architecture design,we shouldnt need "compile".
so finally,i want to confirm whether we need "complie" before we "predict"??yes or no
