Hi there
When I ran the mnist_cnn.py, the system told the words below
Using Theano backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "mnist_cnn.py", line 33, in
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
ValueError: too many values to unpack
Anyone encounters the same problem or has any idea to solve it?
Thanks a lot.
