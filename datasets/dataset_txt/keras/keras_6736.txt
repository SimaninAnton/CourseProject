Hello All,
My code is supposed to be:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D)
Layer2Model = Graph
for i in range(20):
Layer2Model.add(Conv2D)
output=Layer2Model.layers.get_output
model.add(Flatten())
model.layer[1].set_previous(Layer2Model.FinalLayer) //layer[1] means Flatten
model.Dense()
Layer2Model.compile
model.compile
Can we do like this? I tried before, but it seems model didn't connect with Layer2Model..
