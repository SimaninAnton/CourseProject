As mentioned here and seen in the source-code, the new way of creating a convolution layer is by using the Conv*-name. Although there exists an alias Convolution*, the overall design question is, why would anyone want to swap a perfectly named object with a non-trivial abbreviation in a framework such as Keras? Especially when other abbreviations are being removed at the same time (e.g. b_regularizer -> bias_regularizer).
In my experience as a developer, introducing abbreviations is never a good choice, because it makes code harder to read and comprehend (clarity trumps brevity). Especially in core concepts of a framework! I am really interested in the reasons that led to this design decision and would strongly argue that for future releases, the implementation works the other way around again: Having classes called Convolution* and aliases Conv* for convenience reasons and recommending the use of Convolution*.
