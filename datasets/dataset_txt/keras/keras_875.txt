hi everyone, I'm new around, but I have an easy issue: On the code below, I defined verbose =0 but the widget still been displayed, as you can see on the msg showed in the image.
#CODE:
for i in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
print("Epoch {:d}/{:d}".format(i+1, NUM_EPOCHS))
model.fit(Xtrain, Ytrain, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=1, verbose=0,
validation_data=(Xtest, Ytest),
shuffle=False, callbacks=[TQDMNotebookCallback()])
model.reset_states()
It sounds that the frontend does not support the widget, but I thought that once the verbose =0 it would not have any attempt to display the widget!
