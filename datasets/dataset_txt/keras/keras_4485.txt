I got an exception while fitting the model using model.fit() similar to the one here , then I put my computer on hibernate, till now everything is normal. On the next day I tried to start my PC but the monitor didn't detect any GPU I tried to change graphic card slot but with no change, the GPU fans are spinning. I also tried to change the monitor with my Samsung LED TV, the TV was able to detect that there is a current coming from the HDMI cable but the TV stated that there is no signal. So, what is going on !! has this something to do with the exception thrown? I tried all possible solutions and I think the GPU is dead and it needs to be replaced.
I'm using nvidia 660 on windows 10
Theano and Keras are updated to the latest version
