As #1021 says, it would be good to only update the components of an Embedding layer that fire during a forward pass. In Theano, this can be implemented using the inc_subtensor method, but this would horrendously break Tensorflow compatibility.
Is there a similar function available on Tensorflow so I can try and make a solution that works across both backends? If I ever get it done, I can try and submit a pull request for my solution - the main promise is a massive speedup in models with big embeddings!

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
