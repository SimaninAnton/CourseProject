Hi,
I get the following value error in nadam optimizer
TypeError: Input 'y' of 'Pow' Op has type float64 that does not match type float32 of argument 'x'.
The error seems to come from K.pow on get_updates . I am using tensorflow backend and am using float64 as default datatype
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keras/optimizers.py in get_updates(self, params, constraints, loss)
531
532 # Due to the recommendations in [2], i.e. warming momentum schedule
--> 533 momentum_cache_t = self.beta_1 * (1. - 0.5 * (K.pow(0.96, t * self.schedule_decay)))
534 momentum_cache_t_1 = self.beta_1 * (1. - 0.5 * (K.pow(0.96, (t + 1) * self.schedule_decay)))
535 m_schedule_new = self.m_schedule * momentum_cache_t
This is my optimizer definition
optimizer = Nadam(lr=0.002, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-08, schedule_decay=0.004)
