Hi,
I'm currently using keras (2.1.5) with tensorflow(1.5.0) as backend.
I'm trying to use the functional api of keras to build a model and for one of the layers, I use the expand_dims function of the keras.backend. This function returns a tensor that has no attribute named '_keras_history' which causes error when creating the model object.
from keras.backend import expand_dims
from keras.layers import Input
a = Input(shape=[2,2])
b = expand_dims(a,-1)
print(b._keras_history)
Regards,
Shantanu
