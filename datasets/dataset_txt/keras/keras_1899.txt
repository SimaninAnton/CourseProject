Hi all, I was struggling with creating a new layer to add gaussian blur to the INPUT layer.
The shape of gaussian kernel size is (1,1,5,5) which is precalculated(referring to 'g_filter' in the code belew)and the input shape should be (none,3,32,32) since the input shape of my INPUT layer is (3,32,32)
Below is the main code if my def call(self, x, mask = None) function. What I want to do is to create a gaussian blured input which just like the cv2 function cv2.GaussianBlur(img,(5,5),1.0) does to the img.
` def call(self, x, mask = None):
    input_shape = K.shape(x)
    if self.dim_ordering == 'th':
        num_rows = input_shape[2]
        num_cols = input_shape[3]

    elif self.dim_ordering == 'tf':
        num_rows = input_shape[1]
        num_cols = input_shape[2]

    outputs = []
    g_filter = make_kernel(1.0)
    if self.dim_ordering =='th':
        for i in range(3):
            blur =  x[input_shape[0], i,:,:]
            blur = K.reshape(blur,(1,1,num_rows,num_cols))
            blur = K.conv2d(blur,kernel=g_filter, padding='same',data_format='channels_first')
            outputs.append(blur)

    outputs = K.reshape(outputs,(input_shape[0],self.num_channels,num_rows,num_cols))`
While I got the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

I am new to keras and theano. I'll be so grateful if anyone can help.
