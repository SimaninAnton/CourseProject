I have the most popular problem with LSTm I suppose: I can't understand why this part (it is very simple for debugging):
def build_model():
    model = Sequential()
    layers = [1, 50, 100, 1]

    model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(10,1)))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))

    start = time.time()
    model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer="rmsprop")
    print "Compilation Time : ", time.time() - start
    return model

x_train2 = np.reshape(x_train, (3900, 10,1))
y_target = np.ones(shape= (3900))
model2 = build_model()
model2.fit(x_train2, y_target, validation_split = 0.05)
works fine, but when I start evaluating the model, I get the following error:
y_test = np.ones(shape = len(x_test))
pred = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

Error when checking model input: expected dense_input_20 to have 2 dimensions, but got array with shape (121, 10, 1)
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
I don't understand this error at all, as the training examples had the same dimensions.
