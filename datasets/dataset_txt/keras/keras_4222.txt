Feature proposal
Adding a metric to track top-k classification accuracy.
Details
Seeing how metrics like top-5 error rates are increasing in popularity, I was thinking that a metric to track top-k classification performance might be useful. Useful when the argmax() prediction might not match, but subsequent predictions might.
Given that TensorFlow already has a similar metric tf.nn.in_top_k(), it should be possible to include this into keras as well.
I will try to write a simple implementation for this feature and send in a pull request.
