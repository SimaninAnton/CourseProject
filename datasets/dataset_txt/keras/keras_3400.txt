The merge layer with dot, on TensorFlow, outputs a result that's inconsistent with its output shape:
from keras.layers import Embedding, Reshape, Merge
from keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

left = Sequential()
left.add(Embedding(1, 2, input_length=1))
left.add(Reshape((2,)))
right = Sequential()
right.add(Embedding(2, 2, input_length=1))
right.add(Reshape((2,)))
model = Sequential()
model.add(Merge([left, right], mode='dot', dot_axes=1))

print model.output_shape
print model.predict([np.array([0,0]), np.array([0,1])])
Gives the following with Tensorflow:
Using TensorFlow backend.
(None, 1)
[[ 0.00144613 -0.00040156]
 [ 0.00144613 -0.00040156]]
when the expected result's shape is the following (output of the same script, but using the Theano backend):
Using Theano backend.
(None, 1)
[[ 0.00014675]
 [ 0.00027668]]
This leads to unexpected behaviors when trying to fit such layers with a batch_size > 1 on TensorFlow.
(Tested with Keras master, TF 0.12.1 and Theano 0.8.2)
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
