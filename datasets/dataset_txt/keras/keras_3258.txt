Hi All,
I'm fairly new to keras and I was looking to create a CNN that feeds into an LSTM for video classification. Essentially, I have a whole stream of images from a video. Each image is 512x512 pixels. Each sequence of videos is designated a single class, so I do not have a label for each individual image.
Here is what I have so far:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution2D(3, 3, 3, input_shape=(1, 512, 512), activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Convolution2D(3, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Convolution2D(6, 1, 1, activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Convolution2D(6, 1, 1, activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Convolution2D(12, 1, 1, activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Convolution2D(12, 1, 1, activation='relu', border_mode='same'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Reshape((1,49152)))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add((Dense(1)))
model.add(Activation("sigmoid"))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
Earlier I populate the variabel X_train with the images using a for loop that grabs all the images from each sequence, so they're stored in this variable:
X_train[i][0,:,:]=np.array(img)
I then store X_train and y_train as:
X_train=np.array(X_train)
y_train=np.array(y_train)
However, when I try to train the model using:
model.train_on_batch(X_train, y_train)
I get the following error:
ValueError: input arrays should have the same number of samples as target arrays. Found 195 input samples and 1 target samples.
What am I doing wrong?
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
