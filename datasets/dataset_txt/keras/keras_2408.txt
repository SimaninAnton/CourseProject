There are some problems that require working with multispectral images (images with 4+ channels, not only regular RGB) - e.g. satellite analysis.
Currently if one tries working with such images in Keras using ImageDataGenerator, they will face a problem inside NumpyArrayIterator that doesn't allow to use any number of channels except {1, 3, 4}: see https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L771.
I'd suggest one of two options:
make n_channels_allowed a parameter with default value {1, 3, 4} so it raises by default if n_channels is weird, but still allows to pass a new set for those who work with multispectral images;
replace the exception with warning
What do you think?
