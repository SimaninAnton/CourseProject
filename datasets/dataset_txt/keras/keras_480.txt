Training a GAN model using train_on_batch with multiple losses, can I use random loss_weights while compiling a model or is there some specific strategy to use these loss weights as mentioned Here. In my problem, mean_sqaured_error is a loss function for generated_image and original_image and binary_crossentropy is a classification loss function for 0 and 1 class.
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=['mean_squared_error', 'binary_crossentropy'], loss_weights=[100,1])
