Hi,everybody.
I have a convolution network, i want to use an autoencode above the convolution network out, in order to learn the condensed features.
the convolution part is below, how should i do next?
covolution part
convolutionpart=Sequential()
convolutionpart.add(Convolution1d(100,3,input_shape=(trian[1].shape,300)))
convolutionpart.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_length=4))
autoencoder here
