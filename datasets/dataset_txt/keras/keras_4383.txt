For some needs, I change {"backend": "theano"} to {"backend": "tensorflow"} in file '~/.keras/keras.json'. Now I want to use theano again.So I change {"backend": "tensorflow"} back to {"backend": "theano"}. But when I run my scripts, it shows error:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcufft.so locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcuda.so.1 locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcurand.so locally Couldn't import dot_parser, loading of dot files will not be possible. Traceback (most recent call last): File "main.py", line 31, in <module> theano.config.device = 'gpu' File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/theano/configparser.py", line 331, in __set__ "Can't change the value of this config parameter " Exception: Can't change the value of this config parameter after initialization!
What should I do to solve this problems?
