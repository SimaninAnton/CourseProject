I am using following code to get features from an image.

It seems to me that predict process inputs in batches(after looking at verbose logs), but Time taken to predict an output grows linearly with sample size.
Note:
The above code is inspired from https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models
Here is the link to the Github Gist containing both scripts
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
