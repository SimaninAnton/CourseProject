I found this paper yesterday about Binary Networks/Convolutions and XNOR-NET: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05279v1.pdf (XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks).
Anyone tried this to implement in Keras/Tensorflow?
The memory savings looks great. Probably it will be possible just to implement something like Convolution2DBinary layer.
