It is a query and not an issue but I didn't find a place to ask such questions as on stackoverflow, they just downvote saying the question is unclear.
By the way.. I had this query from many days and then looking at backend modules I found that some functions are named differently in different modules like concat in tensorflow and concatenate in cntk. Maybe this is the reason of providing such merged layers.
Also, I found that these layers and backend functions both provide same answers and hence gave a thought of asking it here.
By the way.. just curious to know if there are any processing overheads while using layers instead of backend funcitons? I need to use backend.batch_dot in my project and this can also be done with layers.dot. So, this is also a query for me.
Thank you...
