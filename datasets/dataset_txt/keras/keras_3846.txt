Due to the limitation of memory,I want to use some of samples to train the model firstly, and save the model and weights.Then I load the model and weights, and use the rest of samples to train the model again.I set model.trainable = True.I don't know if there is a difference between the above-mentioned way and using all the samples to train the model
