I am trying to design a CNN which has 12 convolutional2D layers as the input layer (for 12 images).
I then merge them using the 'Merge' function just as in the Keras documentation. The output_shape is 27.
Using a batch_size of 50, I get the error:
Error: Incompatible shapes: [600,27] vs [50, 27]
It is like each of the 12 layers are producing an output separately (12*50 = 600)
what am I doing wrong? please help. This is my first keras project.
thanks a million!
