Hello,
it would be great to be able to be able to train LSTM on the 2D vector in -> 2D vector out basis, like is e.g. OCRopus or in Pybrain.
I am not able to easily reproduce this with Keras right now, since LSTM wants 3D array. I couldn't figure out how to simply transfer matrix, where rows are vectors of integers in specific timestep to this 3D format.
Thank you
