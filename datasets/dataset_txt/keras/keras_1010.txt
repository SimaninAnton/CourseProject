[Y] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I run cifar10_resnet.py, I want to get flatten layer output size but the the result is unknown.
model.get_layer('flatten_1').output
<tf.Tensor 'flatten_1/Reshape:0' shape=(?, ?) dtype=float32>
however, the input is known
model.get_layer('flatten_1').input
<tf.Tensor 'average_pooling2d_1/AvgPool:0' shape=(?, 1, 1, 64) dtype=float32>
Is it bug?
