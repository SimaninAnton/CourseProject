Hi, guys:
recently, I'm reading source codes of keras to improve my usage about it. Actually, I want to combine tensorflow and keras to build a defined network. But when I build a network with keras function API, and want to do some extra operiation. when I want to get a model with:
model = Model(input=[x], output=[y])  ##y is a tensor of tf ops.
It result to error: ouput must be has _keras_shape...
So when the _keras_shape propertiy of tensor is assigned?
what 's the steps?
