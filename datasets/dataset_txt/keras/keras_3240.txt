I have a Keras model with 2 losses. For all even observations I want to make use of both losses, whereas for all odd observations I want to use only the 1st loss. The sample_weight parameter in model.fit() seems to only allow me to multiply the loss contribution across all losses with a single scalar for each observation. How do I make all the odd observations not make use of the 2nd loss?
