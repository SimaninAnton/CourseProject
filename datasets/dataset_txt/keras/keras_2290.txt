I have a time series dataframe like blow, and the number in it is meaning less, and I have some problems when applying LSTM.
I have saw some demos of LSTM, mostly use this pattern: [y_{t-2},y_{t-1},y_{t}] to predict [y_{t+1}], but just as the dataframe blow, I also have featureA, featureB, featureC,
so my quesiton is: how to use multi inputs or multi features to predict target for LSTM
time    featureA    featureB    featureC    target
1   2   5   6   1
2   4   1   7   3
3   6   2   1   5
4   2   4   0   7
5   7   6   1   5
6   9   3   2   8
7   1   2   3   5
8   2   9   5   10
9   1   10  7   6
10  3   2   2   11
