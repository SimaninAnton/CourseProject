Hi, I try to figure out why the keras version from 1.1.1 to 2.0 will decrease the performance of this code https://github.com/titu1994/Snapshot-Ensembles.
My first environment is keras 1.1.1. tensorflow 0.12
Seconde is keras 2.0 tensorflow 1.0
The performance is drop 2 %.
The more confused me is when I design the custom_crossentropy, just use the K.categorical_crossentrop. It is around 15, basicly it is around 5. Can anyone give me the explain for this situation?
