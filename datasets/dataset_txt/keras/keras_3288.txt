The authors of the Wavenet paper propose a variation of dilated 1d convolutions for temporal data dubbed causal dilated convolutions, which essentially implies that output[t] relies solely on input from the 'past': input[x:t] x < t.
Is there interest for a PR that adds a causal flag to AtrousConvolution1D which ensures this behavior? It would entail the following changes to AtrousConvolution1D: https://github.com/basveeling/wavenet/blob/master/wavenet_utils.py#L11
