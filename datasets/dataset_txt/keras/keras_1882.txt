The master branch of keras does not pass the trainable flag when creating Embedding weights:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/embeddings.py#L95
This makes all Embedding layers trainable (silently, without notifying the user) regardless of the parameters passed to the constructor.
