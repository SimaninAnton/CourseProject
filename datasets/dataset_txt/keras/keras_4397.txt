I am training a deep CNN (4 layers) on my data. I used "categorical_crossentropy" as the loss function.
During training, the training loss keeps decreasing and training accuracy keeps increasing until convergence. But the validation loss started increasing while the validation accuracy is still improving.
The curves of loss and accuracy are shown in the following figures:

It also seems that the validation loss will keep going up if I train the model for more epochs. Does anyone have idea what's going on here?
Thanks a lot!
