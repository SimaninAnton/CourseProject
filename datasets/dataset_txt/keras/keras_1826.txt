Documentation of an Embedding Layer is bit not clear...
Does embedding layer performs word2vec or something different?
If it performs word2vec, I would suggest to mention it in documentation)
And to add some relevant reference.
In opinion current reference dropout in RNN is not directly connected to word2vec.
