I converted a few caffe models to Keras using the MarcBS fork. However, upon attempting to load the models, I get this error:
>>> x = keras.models.load_model('vgg16_weights.h5') Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> File "/tigress/dchouren/thesis/git/keras-marcbs/keras/models.py", line 138, in load_model raise ValueError('No model found in config file.') ValueError: No model found in config file.
I then downloaded a pretrained VGG16 model from here: https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3
Attempts to load this model were met with the same error.
Using latest version of Keras (cloned and used python setup.py develop) with Python 3.5.2 and Theano backend. Have not changed anything in Keras develop except for adding some print lines. I am using the non-forked Keras when I attempted to load these models, although the forked version also fails with the same error.
Anyone see this before?
