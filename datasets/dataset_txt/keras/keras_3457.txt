Hello guys,
I am trying to use Siamese network to learn the similarity.
I tried mnist_siamese_graph.py on Github . After training, the accuracy on training set and on test set are very low and unstable as well.
Is the performance normal for Siamese network? Or do I misunderstand the low accuracy?
I am new in Siamese network, and sorry for asking basic questions. if anyone can explain it, I'll very appreciate it!
Thank you very much! :-)
