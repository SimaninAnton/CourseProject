ModelCheckpoint saves the model after every epoch. I think It might be convenient to allow saving the model every k epochs.
Proposed changes
Add parameter step in constructor with default value 1
If the total number of iteration is not a multiply of step, also save the model after training, i.e., in on_train_end.
