Hello,
I am working on re-implementing the Generative and Discriminative Voxel Modeling with CNNs. At the decoder level of the architecture, they are using fractionally strided convolutions - as shown here.
Using TF 0.10rc0 with latest keras, it is not possible to perform e.g. Convolution3D(32, 3, 3, 3, activation='relu', subsample=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))(x), with a generated error in tf
ZeroDivisionError: Intiger division or modulo by zero
Is there a workaround without explicitly performing upsampling in 3D?
