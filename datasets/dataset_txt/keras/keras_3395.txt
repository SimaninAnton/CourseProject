Hi,
I want to train a LSTM that learns given a frame of video, predict the next frame of the video. I extracted 20 frames from each video and each frame is passed through a CNN to get a 512 dimensional feature embedding for the frame i.e., each frame is now represented by a 512 dimensional feature vector and I have 20 frames for each video.
So my input has shape of X_train = (no_videos, 20, 512) and similarly my output has shape of Y_train = (no_videos,20,512) which are the shifted frames.
After training, I pass each video frame by frame for the network to predict the next frame and I want to extract the memory cell gate activations after the final frame is predicted for that video. This means I want the memory cell gate activations for each video after predicting the final frame (so that the information of the entire video is embedded).
Could someone please help how to do this ?
Thanks in advance.
