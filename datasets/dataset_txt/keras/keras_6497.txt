I'm new to keras. Recently, I ran an automatic test, keras\tests\auto\test_graph_model.py.
It fails only because of the function test_2o_1i_weights(self) inside this file. Specifically, it only can't pass the test test a non-sequential graph with 1 input and 2 outputs because of the Assertion (loss < 4.0). Since all tests could pass after I commented on the line assert (loss < 4.)
The result for test a non-sequential graph with 1 input and 2 outputs is shown below.
I appreciate any ideas about it. Some setting are as follows.
Keras version: 0.2.0
OS: Windows 8.1 (I have to dual-boot on this PC with the pre-installed Windows later. At least now, I can't use Linux on VM lack of GPU visualization.)
Theano version
