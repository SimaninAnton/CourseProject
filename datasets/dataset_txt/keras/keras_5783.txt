Hello, I was experimenting with Keras and noticed that I could not reproduce the same results even when I defined a np.seed(). Looking at the code it uses python random instead of numpy random. Shouldn't it be using numpy random?
If it should be using numpy random I have made that modification locally and can submit a pull request to correct this issue.
