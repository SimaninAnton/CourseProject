I have found the documentation for sample weights in multi-output models to be lacking. It does not tell you of the correct format to include sample weights in, for a multi-output model.
While some trial-and-error helped me figure it out, it would've saved me and my collaborators some anguish if the documentation was clear beforehand.
Please add better documentation about this.
