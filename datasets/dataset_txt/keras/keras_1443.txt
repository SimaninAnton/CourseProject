Due to the error introduced in #8056 , custom loss functions with mismatching shapes for y_true and y_pred resulted in an exception being thrown. This issue is fixed in #8514 . However this fix is not present in the latest Keras release, so I'm forced to use master or 2.0.9.
Eventhough it is in the README.md and a clear issue is open for this, I see roughly every day someone asking about this error on https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet . My request is if there can be a bump in Keras version so that we can tell people to update to the latest Keras.
