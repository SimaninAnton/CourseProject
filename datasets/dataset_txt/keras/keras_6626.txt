Hi,
I just installed keras from master on Github and seem to be encountering some errors with the example files. I'm running on CentOS 6.6 on a GPU node. A Theano test script worked without a hitch. However, when running mnist_mlp.py, for example, I am thrown the following error:
[enf@gpu-9-3 ~/keras/examples]$ python mnist_mlp.py 
Using gpu device 0: GeForce GTX TITAN Black (CNMeM is disabled)
60000 train samples
10000 test samples
ERROR (theano.gof.opt): SeqOptimizer apply inplace_elemwise_optimizer
ERROR (theano.gof.opt): Traceback:

    ret = self.apply(fgraph, *args, **kwargs)

  File "/home/enf/Theano/theano/scalar/basic.py", line 1998, in __init__
    raise TypeError(o_type)
TypeError: transfer_type{0}
The same error was thrown from the other example scripts as well.
Any idea what this means or how to fix it?
Thank you for your help!!
Cheers,
Evan
