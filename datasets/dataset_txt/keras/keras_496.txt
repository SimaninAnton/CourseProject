So my issue is when Im trying to make the first Conv2D layer of my CNN
I have scoured the docs, and the web for hours finding different answers and I've bruteforced every possible combination of input_shape. Basically, the parameter input_shape (for the Conv2D layer) is behaving weird. I set input_shape to (28, 28, 3) which is the rows, columns, and channels of my images.
I have also tried adding channels first. I have also tried setting data_format to "channels_last" etc.
I keep getting an error no matter what. Here is my most recent error
ValueError: Error when checking input: expected conv2d_1_input to have 4 dimensions, but got array with shape (60000, 28, 28)
Here is the code:
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', input_shape = (28,28,1)))
Please help thank you
