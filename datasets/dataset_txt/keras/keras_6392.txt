I would like to design a loss function base on the Ranking score, which is not directly derived from y_pred and y_true.
My idea is to input two feature, that's say 64 + 64 = 128 concatenate together as the input layer and output the 1 unit regression of these two feature.
I am using Muti-layer Perceptron structure.
Input: X and Xselect (64+64 unit)
Output: y (1 unit)
where Xselect is a feature selected from Xlibrary to compare with X. So I expect to get the output candidates by looping the X with the selections of X in library to make a rank. Then use those the rank list as the loss function by Mean Reciprocal Rank.
In short, I need to calculate multiple forward propagation to create the rank list, and to make my loss function. I wonder if it is possible to do that in Keras? Or I should define the function in then?
