Is there a straight-forward approach to create an arbitrary recurrent connection between layers?
Say I have a 3 layer RNN and I want the output of the last layer at (t-1) to be fed in as an additional input of the intermediate layer at time t. Is there a straight-forward way to do that?
Am I right that the easiest way is to create a custom layer that controls the logic of the three layers I talked about?
