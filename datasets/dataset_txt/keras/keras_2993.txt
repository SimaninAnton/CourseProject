I'm working with some images which are all contained in a single folder, with classes distinguished by a part of the file name.
Naturally, I could restructure the data to match flow_from_directory (a really convenient function) but I don't control the original source of the data so I'd rather use it in its original form.
And I think this might come up again, so I'm working on a method flow_from_list_of_files that works like flow_from_directory, except that it loads files from a list of (path, class) pairs instead of a fixed directory structure.
And I was wondering if this is something that might be welcome as a feature of Keras, and if I should submit a PR when it's finished.
(And if so, what would be the preferred argument: a list of file paths, a generator, or ... ?)
