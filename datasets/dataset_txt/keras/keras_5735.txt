output of NN is probability of correct decision
for example
actual labels: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
detected: 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
so number of correct decisions is 7
number of mistakes is 3
then probability of correct decision is 3/10 = 0.3, so code gives me this number 0.3, in lstm case is it is named accuracy
but if I know that for first test sample 1 was detects 0 with reliability 0.3 ,
then I may mark this sample as detected with low reliability
Related to this question is question how to get these decisions from NN
so I need these
detected data: 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
seems to be it is kind of
batch_outs = f(ins_batch)
from
functoin
def _test_loop(self, f, ins, batch_size=128, verbose=0):
from
file models.py
