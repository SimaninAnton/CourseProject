Similar to how I removed time_distributed_softmax, and just made it always apply softmax to the last axis (i.e. the nb_dimensions) axis, is there any reason that I don't make Dense have the same behavour, so you can pass it either a (nb_samples, nb_dims) or a (nb_samples, nb_timesteps, nb_dims) matrix? Seems like it reduces complexity with no downside.
