Hi,
I have following simple model.
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max_words, embedding_size, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(embedding_size, dropout_W=dropout, dropout_U=dropout, W_regularizer=l2(l2_value)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  optimizer='adam',
                  metrics=['accuracy']
Now I want to compute a saliency map of this model. In order to do this I want to get an Theano tensor which I could apply to automatic differentiation in Keras / Theano. But to be honest - I don't know how to do that. Does someone have any idea how to get that?
Best,
Marcin
