Hello, I am new to neural networks and I am trying to make a convolutional neural network.
I don't know which loss function do i need to use.
I take an image as an input, and output is a numpy array [1,1,0,0] or [1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,1] etc.
You can't use categorical crossentropy because you need one to be 1 and others to be 0, right? So, what I should use?
And, what activation i should apply as the last layer of the model?
