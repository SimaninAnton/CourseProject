I am trying to perform images segmentation.
In one directorty I have a list of files :
Image1.tif
Image2.tif
Image3.tif
And in an other directory the masks :
Mask1.tif
Mask2.tif
Mask3.tif
If I say to flow_from_directory with shuffle=False or Shuffle=True but seeds are the same, I expect the files to be yielded in the same order. They are not.
A simple self.filenames.sort() juste before shuffling should solve the problem.
