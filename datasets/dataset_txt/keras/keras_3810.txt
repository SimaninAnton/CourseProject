Hi, how can deal with the issue about input with varying dimensions, like images with different sizes, but not using resize or padding zeros? I meant to train network with cnn and rnn, like the following:
conv block 1
model.add(Convolution1D(64,5, input_shape=X_train.shape[1:]))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_length=3))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
conv block 2
model.add(Convolution1D(32,5))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_length=3))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
GRU block 1 & 2
model.add(GRU(16,return_sequences=True))
model.add(GRU(16,return_sequences=False))
Since both cnn and rnn can handle inputs with varying dimension, i thought i could feed inputs with varying dimension into this network, but not knowing how when we have to specify the input_shape for the first layer.
Can anyone help me?
Thanks!
