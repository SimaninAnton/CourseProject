I think the examples provided with IMDB sentiment analysis is cool, but it is specifically written for imdb dataset.
I think, the idea of this example is text classification, with a set of documents with label, then use this dataset to predict the label of new document.
It would be better if there is another utilities which will read the bunch of documents and analyze the frequency of these documents, so there will be X_train, X_test automatically, and x_train, x_test can be fetched manually.
So, it may looks like:
docs = doc.load_data (path_to_directory_contains_all_documents)
label = doc.load_label (path_to_file_contains_label_of_all_documents)
docs_train = ...
docs_test = ...
...
