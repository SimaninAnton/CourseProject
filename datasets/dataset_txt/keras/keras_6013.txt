Hello,
I'm trying to add weights to the classes during training, the output shape of the last layer (softmax) is (batch_size, length, nb_class) with one-hot-label of the same size, and categorical_crossentropy loss is used here.
I've tried to use class_weight in fit and send class weight as dictionary: {0:w1, 1:w2, ...}, but got the error: Exception: class_weight not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.
Could someone suggest a way of doing this in Keras? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
