Mentioned in the "mega-issue" #100, though it would be worth having a separate one.
The simplest model zoo is a github wiki page, another option it to have it as a page in the documentation and receive updates via push requests.
I think model zoo matters most for models that take "more 6 hours to train" (i.e. a large fraction of 24h).
