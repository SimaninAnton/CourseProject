I am trying to create an RNN for miRNA target prediction. And I have 2 encoder output that I need to concatenate before i feed it into the RNN.
I tried" final_weight = concatenate([miRNA_encodings, mRNA_encodings],axis=-1)"
But i am getting the error :
ValueError: Layer concatenate_1 was called with an input that isn't a symbolic tensor. Received type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>.
