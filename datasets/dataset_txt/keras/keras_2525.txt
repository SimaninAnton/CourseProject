From what I understand, Keras loads data onto a GPU one mini-batch at a time.
This is fine for situations where the data is very high dimensional, but I work in a domain where there are less than 1K features per a sample and I have up to 70M samples in an epoch. With a mini-batch size of 256, one mini-batch is roughly 1Mb.
Is there anyway to get keras to preload data on to the GPU? My home-made Theano implementation does this - I load data onto the card in huge chunks and walk through the chunks in small mini-batches.
