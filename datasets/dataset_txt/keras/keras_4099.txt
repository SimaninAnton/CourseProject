Hi all,
I am working on a model that does a binary classification and a regression jointly. The idea is that I only want to do the regression when the classification is positive.
So during training I have the classification and the regression output, but then for the regression I'd like to ignore those samples where the classification target is a zero.
I have considered sample_weighting but this applies to the entire output.
Another option would be to write a custom mse loss that ignores nan's and then put nan's as regression targets for 0-classification targets. But then I will also ignore nan's in the loss if they are there due to an error, so I'd like to avoid that.
Are there other ways I can achieve what I'm trying to do ?
Thank you!
