Despite that in the keras.jason file the backend is set to tensorflow, each time that I activate my tensorflow environment the backend is set to theano.
C:\Users\Uriel\Anaconda3\Scripts>activate tensorflow
(tensorflow) C:\Users\Uriel\Anaconda3\envs\tensorflow\etc\conda\activate.d>set "KERAS_BACKEND=theano"
writing set "KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow" does nothing.
Please, help me to set the backend to tensorflow.
