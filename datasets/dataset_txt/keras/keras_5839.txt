Hello,
Say I have weights from a trained network and now I want to change the architecture of the network by adding 2 more filters for the last convolutional layer. For the new network, I don't want to train it from scratch again, I want to load the existing weights to the network while initializing the weights for the added 2 filters using other techniques. Is there a way to do it in Keras?
