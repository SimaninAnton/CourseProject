I am building a model using the Functional API and require a custom layer for a bias term. I have attempted to implement a custom layer called Bias which outputs a vector of length output_dim.
class Bias(Layer):
 ...
    def call(self, x=None,mask=None):
        output = self.b
        return self.activation(output)

    def get_output_shape_for(self, input_shape):
            return (1, self.output_dim)
Usage:
bias = Bias(N)()
merged = merge([X,bias],mode='concat')
The problem is that the call function expects an input tensor even if as in this case the input tensor is not used. I have attempted to produce a work around but keep getting various Keras errors.
Please can someone suggest an appropriate solution for the Bias layer.
Many thanks.
