I am having a problem when trying to implement the pairwise ranking loss mentioned in this paper "Deep Convolutional Ranking for Multilabel Image Annotation". When I defined the pairwise ranking function, I found that y_true and y_predict are actually Tensors, which means that we do not know which are positive labels and which are negative labels according to y_true. And I cannot transform this loss into a tensor operation. Could anybody solve this problem?
Thanks in advance!
