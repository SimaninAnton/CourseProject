I'm not sure what is going on the with this layer but it does not take an axis dim. Possibly just a feature missing.
In [43]: x = keras.Input(shape=(10,))

In [44]: keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(x, x, from_logits=True)
Out[44]: <tf.Tensor 'softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_11/Reshape_2:0' shape=<unknown> dtype=float32>


TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
