We are trying to make all the files in the codebase have a line lenght below 85. This has been done to nearly all files. Just five are not done yet:
keras/backend/cntk_backend.py
keras/backend/common.py
keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py
keras/backend/theano_backend.py
tests/keras/backend/backend_test.py
If you want to take up this issue, please make one Pull request per file (you don't have to do all five pull requests at once). And once the lines are shorter for one file, you can remove the corresponding exception in the https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/pytest.ini to enable the tests.
