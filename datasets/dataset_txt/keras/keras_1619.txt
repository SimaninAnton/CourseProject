In a typical scenario with multiple outputs, each output has a related label, and a loss function.
However, in some cases it's desirable to return additional data that isn't used for training (for example: attention mask)
currently I'm adding dummy labels and dummy loss functions, but I was wondering if there's a cleaner way
