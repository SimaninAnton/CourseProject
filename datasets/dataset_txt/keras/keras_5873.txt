Whenever I attempt to load my best model (using ModelCheckpoints), it returns an error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "LCRN.py", line 181, in <module>
    train_model(model, data[train], labels[train])
  File "LCRN.py", line 110, in train_model
    model.load_weights("best_model.h5")
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/models.py", line 584, in load_weights
    self.layers[k].set_weights(weights)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/layers/core.py", line 136, in set_weights
    raise Exception("Layer shape %s not compatible with weight shape %s." % (K.get_value(p).shape, w.shape))
Exception: Layer shape (4, 1, 16, 16) not compatible with weight shape (5, 1, 16, 16).
For some strange reason, it seems to assume testing is done over 5 samples. Any idea as to why?
