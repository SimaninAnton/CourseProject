Hi everyone.
I realize this problem when i try to load model saved by keras.model.save_model(). it will raise an Error say ('Unknown loss function', ':bar1_loss'). bar1_loss function was write on the python script where i build and train the model, Of course the load_model() function can't recognize it. Similar problem occured when the model i try to load contains Lamba layer whichs function use global name , the load_model() function can't recognize the global name too. Is it really a problem or it can be fixed in some way?
Thanks :)
