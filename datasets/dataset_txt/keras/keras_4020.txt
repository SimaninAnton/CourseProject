From addition_rnn.py (lines 38-43):
    Given a set of characters:
    + Encode them to a one hot integer representation
    + Decode the one hot integer representation to their character output
    + Decode a vector of probabilities to their character output
What is a one hot integer representation and why is it used in this scenario? Why is it used? I searched it and couldn't find a definition using Google. Can you please explain?
