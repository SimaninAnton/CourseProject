I'm new to Keras, and I find it hard to understand the shape of input data of the LSTM layer.The Keras Document says that the input data should be 3D tensor with shape (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim).
I understand in this way ,please tell me if I'm wrong. If I have 1000 sentences ,each sentence has 10 words, and each word is presented in a 3-dim vector, so 1000 is nb_samples, 10 is the timesteps and 3 is the input_dim, am I right?
Another question, if the shape of my data is 9000* 10 , 9000 is the nb_sample, and 10 is the input_dim, should I set the time step as 1? If so ,how could the LSTM find time information during training? Actually, I want to give every five 1*10 vectors a label, should I set the timesteps as 5 and reshape my data?
Thank you very much!
