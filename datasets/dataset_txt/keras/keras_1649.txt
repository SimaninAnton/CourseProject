The problem occurs time to time during loading the model:
mdl = tf.contrib.keras.models.load_model(join(MODELS_PATH, 'sentiment', 'nn_model.h5'))
The most annoying thing is that sometimes it loads well, but from time to time it shows this error:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Shape [-1,12] has negative dimensions
[[Node: embedding_1_input = Placeholderdtype=DT_INT32, shape=[?,12], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]]
