I designed a multi-output model with 3 loss. here is the output of my model:
output1 = Dense(outoutClaas,activation='softmax')(BT1)
output2 = Dense(outclassL12,activation='softmax')(BT1)
output3 = Dense(outclassL3,activation='softmax')(BT1)
model = Model(input=inputs, output=[output1, output2,output3])
The model training well, but i am getting errors during the prediction:
model.predict(input)
ValueError: Tensor Tensor("Softmax:0", shape=(?, 7201), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.
7201 is the number of the classes of the first output.
My questions is how can it get the prediction from output1, output2, output3, separately?
Thank you for your help...
