I checked a model h5 file and i saw that the weights of the layers are kept in a dictionary having as key the layer name. If i want to load the weights of another network with the exact same structure from another model file where the only thing that differs is the layer names, how can i do it?
Since the layers are kept in a dictionary which is sorted alphabetically i see no way of initialising a second model without first creating and compiling the old one.
Is this right or I am missing something?
