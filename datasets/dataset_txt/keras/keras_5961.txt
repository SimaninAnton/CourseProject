I am trying to use TimeDistributedMerge but am running into some issues. Currently, it subclasses layer, but I see no reason why it shouldn't support masking (all of the merging operations could simply ignore the masked values).
I don't think I am familiar enough with the standards of MaskingLayers to implement this currently. I'm working on it right now but would appreciate any insights.
