Why the input_shape of first ConvLSTM2D layer is (None, 40, 40, 1)ï¼Ÿ
Shouldn't it be (None, timessteps, 40, 40, 1)?
#We create a layer which take as input movies of shape
#(n_frames, width, height, channels) and returns a movie
#of identical shape.
seq = Sequential()
seq.add(ConvLSTM2D(nb_filter=40, nb_row=3, nb_col=3,
input_shape=(None, 40, 40, 1),
border_mode='same', return_sequences=True))
