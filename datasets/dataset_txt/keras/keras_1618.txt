I had to switch to native keras from tensorflow keras because of a bug fix that isn't yet included in tensorflow.
I experienced some issues when running the same code using the two different versions
The main issue was solved by suplying outputshape to a lambda layer calling a tensorflow function (einsum)
while this issue was solved, I want to know if there are other incompatibilities that may casue issues (errors, or different behaviour)
ther versions I used were tensorflow 1.3.0 and keras 2.0.8
