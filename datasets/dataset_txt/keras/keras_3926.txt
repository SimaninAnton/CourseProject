(Let me know if there's a better place to post this)
I'd like to write a new backend that uses code we're developing.
As a trial I did the following:
modified ~/.keras/keras.json: "backend": "lbann"
In keras/backend: cp tensorflow_backend.py lbann_backend.py
re-ran python setup.py install
$python
from keras import backend as K
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "keras/init.py", line 2, in
from . import backend
ImportError: cannot import name backend
Any advice as to what I need to do to get started are welcome.
thanks, Dave Hysom
