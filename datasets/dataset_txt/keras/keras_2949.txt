Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
https://gist.github.com/around1991/cb6e8b7d17c3d1d0362e16e5a91e0dbb reliably reproduces the bug.
The issue is in line 2131 of topology.py: if mask is one of the kwargs when the layer was originally called in the inner model, then the mask kwarg is stored in layer.call, and isn't refreshed when model.call() is called.
