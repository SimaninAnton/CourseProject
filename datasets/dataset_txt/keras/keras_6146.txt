I'd like to see How the learning rate change during the training stage, so I print the learning rate with Callback. The RMSprop optimizer is able to change the learning rate itself, but I find they not change with the following code.
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.
rms = RMSprop()
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=rms)
class LearningRatePrinter(Callback):
def init(self):
super(LearningRatePrinter, self).init()
def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs={}):
    print 'lrearning_rate:', self.model.optimizer.lr.get_value()
lr_printer = LearningRatePrinter()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=nb_epoch, show_accuracy=True, verbose=2, callbacks=[lr_printer])
