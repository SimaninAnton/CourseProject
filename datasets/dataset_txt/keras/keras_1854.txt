I want to train a ConvLSTM network (keras/examples/conv_lstm.py) without any biases. So given the documentation, I used use_bias=false. But it still produces bias arrays when I check the weights.
When use_bias=true there are two sets of biases: one has length 4*#filters and another is four arrays of length #filters each. Having use_bias=false removes the first set of biases but the second set still remains.
So I am not exactly sure what that second set of biases are and how can that also be removed?
