It would be nice to add support for the tensorflow dataset API to the Tensorboard callback. Specifically, it appears that the histogram_freq option is not currently supported. Currently if I pass in a dataset for validation data, I get the following error:
TypeError: The value of a feed cannot be a tf.Tensor object. Acceptable feed values include Python scalars, strings, lists, numpy ndarrays, or TensorHandles.For reference, the tensor object was Tensor("strided_slice:0", shape=(32, 512, 128, 2), dtype=float32) which was passed to the feed with key Tensor("input_1:0", shape=(?, 512, 128, 2), dtype=float32).
Looking at the source code this seems to be because a feed dict is being used.
