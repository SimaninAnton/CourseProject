As seen here, Keras just ignores ValueErrors raised by a generator.
                        try:
                            generator_output = next(generator)
                        except ValueError:
                            continue
Is it for thread safety? If it is, then I think a thread safe wrapper would be a better approach (see this post about the subject). I just spent 1 hour trying to track down a bug because Keras was intercepting my exceptions.
