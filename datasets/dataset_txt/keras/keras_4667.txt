In the metrics module, the way binary accuracy is calculated assumes your predictions and labels are 0/1. However, if you're using hinge loss, your training labels are -1/1, and so the accuracy metric will give incorrect results.
It's easy to work around (define a custom metric to use), but it is slightly inconvenient to the user who assumes that binary accuracy will automatically do the right thing. Is there any way the binary accuracy metric can be a bit cleverer and look at the loss that's used?
