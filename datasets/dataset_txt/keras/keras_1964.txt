I use Lambda layer define an option, but when i try to use the output of Lambda layer, I get this issue:
theano.tensor.var.AsTensorError: ('Cannot convert <keras.layers.core.Lambda object at 0x17b47e10> to TensorType', <class 'keras.layers.core.Lambda'>)
Here is my code:
rev_visual_gate = Lambda(lambda_rev_gate, output_shape=(sent_maxlen, final_tweet_word_embedding))
img_gate = merge([rev_visual_gate, img_w_new], mode='mul')
and the Lambda function is defined as follow:
def lambda_rev_gate(x):
one = K.ones((sent_maxlen, final_tweet_word_embedding), dtype='int16')
rev_gate = one-x
return rev_gate
Can anyone help me?
