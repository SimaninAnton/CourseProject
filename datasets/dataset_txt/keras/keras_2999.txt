Hello,
I've encountered an error similar to this issue
At first, the error occurs when executing "d_loss = discriminator.train_on_batch(...)".
So I tried the solution in the link above (add discriminator._make_train_function() before building the combined model ). And the "discriminator.train_on_batch()" passed.
But when the script moves on to "g_loss = dual_dis0.train_on_batch(...)" (dual_dis0 is the combined gan model in my script). The similar error occurs again. I don't know how to solve it this time.
Because my script is a bit too long to put it here, may I put the link of my code here?
the error can be reproduced with "python model$train.py" after cloning it.
