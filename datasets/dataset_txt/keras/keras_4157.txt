I've been trying to the shape of a tensor in the custom loss function but Keras has been giving me this error at model.compile(loss=custom_loss, ...):
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'dense_4_target' with dtype float
[[Node: dense_4_target = Placeholderdtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"]]
and here is my code for it:
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    print "Reached"
    print K.eval(K.shape(y_true))
    print "Not reached"
I understand that a Tensor is a virtual place holder that only has values (and shapes) when it is filled, but shouldn't it be filled when the loss function is called? Thank you very much for your help!
