Is that test_on_batch()'s callback means the accuracy and loss just on one batch of the test dataset, and evaluate()'s callback means the accuracy and loss over the all test dataset?
for example; my test dataset's size is 1000, if I set the batch size to 200, the test_on_batch returns the accuracy and loss of the recent 200 samples from the test dataset. And If I use evaluate(), also set batch size to 200, but I got the accuracy and loss over the all test dataset(1000 samples).
Am I right?
thanks for releasing this project.
