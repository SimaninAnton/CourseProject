So this is the code:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(1,input_shape=(None,1506),dropout=0.2))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',optimizer='sgd')

model.fit(x_train,y_train,nb_epoch=15,batch_size=32)
the error is:
ValueError: Error when checking model input: expected lstm_29_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (203158, 1506)
I don't understand, I'm using theano and don't want to use time stamp so I pass as input_shape (None, # of featurs) but then it requires 3 dimensions??
