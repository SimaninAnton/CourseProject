Thus you can't load models created with custom components, (in this case a custom regularizer)
This happens because custom object entries are copied into the globals dict for keras.utils (in keras.utils.layer_from_config), but the globals dict from the top level keras package is passed into get_from_module from the get function in regularizers.py.
I am sure this pattern is repeated elsewhere (from activation.py, optimizers.py, etc...) but I have not looked in all of them
