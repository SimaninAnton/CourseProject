I have some problem using Keras model for prediction in parallel, details described here. Today I read some code from jaara/AI-blog/CartPole-A3C.py and found this:
model = Model(inputs=[l_input], outputs=[out_actions, out_value])
model._make_predict_function() # have to initialize before threading
I think this is what makes difference. So can anyone tells me how this function works? I can't find any documentation about it.
edit:
I put the same issue here and got an reply. But I want more information from the Keras Community.
