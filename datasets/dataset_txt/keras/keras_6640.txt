Dear all,
I would like to use the output of a layer as the index of another layer's output.
Such as:
inputs = [self.layers[i].get_output(train) for i in range(len(self.layers))] 
aa=inputs[1]
index=T.cast(inputs[0],'int64')
return aa[index]
Actually, the inputs[0] is the return value of the layer A, which:
return T.nonzero(the inputs of layerA,axis=0)
I get the error:
TypeError: AdvancedSubtensor1.grad illegally returned an integer-valued variable. (Input index 0, dtype int64)
I have upgraded my theano to the developing version.
If I don't cast the inputs[0] to int manually, the error would be: "index must be integers".
How can I solve this problem?
Thanks a LOT!!
