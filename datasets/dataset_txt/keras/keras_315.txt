I have a model with multiple outputs from different layers: O: output from softmax layer; y1,y2: from intermediate hidden layer.
  `m = keras.models.Model (inputs=x, outputs=[O,y1,y2])`
I want to compute cross-entropy loss between O and true labels and MSE loss between y1 and y2. My custom loss function will be like:
  ```
  def Myloss(O_true, O_pred, y1, y2):
        MSE = mean_squared_error(y1, y2)
        CE = categorical_crossentropy(O_true, O_pred)
        return MSE + CE 

  ```
Now how do I pass the model outputs to
model.compile(loss='Myloss', ...)
