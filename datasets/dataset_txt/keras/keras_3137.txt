I try to customize an RNN layer that will sequentially add the first element of the input vectors to the current hidden state. But the following code doesn't seem to work.
def step(self, x, states):
    h = states[0]
    h_new = h + x[0] # not work
    ...
    return h_new, [h_new]
Anybody could help?
