I'm working on a Graph network which at various points has to multiply or divide the outputs of two preceding nodes. It looks like I can sum or concatenate the outputs of two such nodes using the merge_mode and inputs options, but there is no clear way to perform any other binary functions. Am I missing an alternative or is this a limitation in the current syntax of Keras?
Thanks!
ps. oh, and using log and exp activations to perform multiplications using the merge_mode=sum also seems to run into trouble (no complex number support?). Not that this is an elegant solution in any way ...
