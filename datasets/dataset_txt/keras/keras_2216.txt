Hello, I was wondering how can I monitor a different value on the end of each epoch. My goal is to monitor the F1 score, and I have written the function in tensor format, but I donÂ´t know how to integrate in the callback.
I was searching the source of 'val_acc' and 'val_loss' but I didn't find it.
Thanks!
