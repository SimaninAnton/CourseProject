I have a Keras model, which runs on an HPC managed by Altair PBS, the neural network is successfully trained but when saving the model I get a .h5 file with size 0 (zero) completely empty. In addition I also tried to split files in .json definition and weights h5 and I get the json file correctly written the .h5 file always in size 0 (zero) and empty.
Thanks in advice
