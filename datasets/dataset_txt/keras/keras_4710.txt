Hi all,
I am trying to run the 3D CNN Example here with the convolution 3D example in examples/shapes_3d_cnn.py by MinhazPalasara. I've updated Keras already. When I was running it, here's the error that I'm getting:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "shapes_3d_cnn.py", line 75, in <module>
    model.add(Convolution3D(nb_filters[0], nb_depth=nb_conv[0], nb_row=nb_conv[0], nb_col=nb_conv[0], border_mode='full',input_shape=(1, patch_size, patch_size, patch_size), activation='relu'))
TypeError: __init__() takes at least 5 arguments (4 given)
I don't know what is the problem (my machine?) when other people in the thread seem to got it working! Any insights?
Thanks!
