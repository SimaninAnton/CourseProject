image.py line 646:
        if x.shape[self.channel_axis] not in {3, 4}:
            warnings.warn(
                'Expected input to be images (as Numpy array) '
                'following the data format convention "' + self.data_format + '" '
                '(channels on axis ' + str(self.channel_axis) + '), i.e. expected '
                'either 1, 3 or 4 channels on axis ' + str(self.channel_axis) + '. '
                'However, it was passed an array with shape ' + str(x.shape) +
                ' (' + str(x.shape[self.channel_axis]) + ' channels).')
So if x.shape[self.channel_axis] equals 1, you get a warning that says it shouldn't be a warning?
If it's just a matter of changing to
        if x.shape[self.channel_axis] not in {1, 3, 4}:
I wouldn't mind submitting the pull request myself
