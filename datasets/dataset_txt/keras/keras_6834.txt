I might be wrong, but I think that every call to model.fit resets the accumulated states (such as momentum, etc.) in the optimizers. I think it would be great if the optimizers could essentially pick up where they left off training, or at least have the option of doing so. I don't think this would be difficult to do, but I'd like to have some feedback before trying to make this work.
