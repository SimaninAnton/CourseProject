Hi,
I would like to know if there is a current initiative on implementing a MemN2N type of framework, i.e parametric model with non-parametric state, inside keras. I could also mention in the same kind the stacked-RNN and NTM type of models, I'm not sure the current architecture of keras allows to implement such type of model, but I may be wrong.
Thanks!
Julien
