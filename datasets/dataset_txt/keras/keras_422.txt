I think notebook versions of the current Keras examples, with the outputs and visualizations, should be included. I think it will help Keras newcomers a lot in understanding exactly what's happening.
I have almost all the examples on my local machine as .ipynb files (I had to copy paste parts of the code into notebooks manually). I can organize them into folders like "sequence-modeling-examples", "vision-models-examples" etc and add them to the current examples folder, if the people concerned approve of this idea.
[y] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[y] Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
[n] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
