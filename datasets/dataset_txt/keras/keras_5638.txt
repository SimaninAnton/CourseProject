Hi there,
I am trying to implement a classification problem with three classes: 0,1 and 2. I would like to fine tune my cost function so that missclassification is weighted some how. In particular, predicting 1 instead of 2 should give twice the cost than predicting 0. writing it in a table format, it should be something like that:
Costs:
Predicted:
0 | 1 | 2
__________________________
Actual 0 | 0 | 0.25 | 0.25
1 | 0.25 | 0 | 0.5
2 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0
I really like keras framework, it would be nice if it is possible to implement it and not having to dig into tensorflow or theano code.
Thanks
