In Keras' doc, there is an DAE (Denoising AutoEncoder) example. The following is the link
https://keras.io/examples/mnist_denoising_autoencoder/
As we know, an autoencoder consists of an encoder and decoder network, and the output of the encoder is the input of the encoder. But when I examined the code over and again, I found that the input of the decoder (called latent) in the example is also the input of the encoder. It puzzles me a lot.
Please note the decoder uses variable latent_inputs as its input, but latent_inputs comes from variable Input, not from the output of the encoder which is variable latent.
Could anyone tell me why it is like that? Or is that a mistake in the doc? Thanks a lot.
