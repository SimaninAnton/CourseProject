In Keras 2 (branch keras-2), the API for pretty much every layer has changed. We will keep supporting the Keras 1 API, and we will do so via API conversion decorators.
As an example, I have written the conversion decorator for the Dense layer. It was done in this commit: 5516c8f
The decorator code is here: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/keras-2/keras/legacy/interfaces.py#L15
The test for it is here: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/keras-2/tests/keras/legacy/interface_test.py#L8
In order to launch Keras 2, we will need such decorators for every layer (and also for training routines and model constructors). If you want to contribute, please add these decorators (in keras/legacy/interfaces.py, with tests in tests/keras/legacy/interface_test.py). You just need to follow the template laid out with the Dense layer decorator.
You can leave out the Conv*D layers for now, since they will require special handling due to a positional/keyword argument conflict.
Thanks a lot!
