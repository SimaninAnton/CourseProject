My current model is compiled as
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd, metrics=['accuracy'])
and I get predictions like
[[ 1.  0.  0.  0.]]
[[ 0.  1.  0.  0.]]
Instead I'd like my class predictions to show a percentage
 [[ 0.8  0.1  0.1  0.4]]
Elsewhere I was advised to use loss='mse', but this was discouraged by another user.
This issue does not seem addressed in the docs (I'd be glad to add to docs any insight you can give).
Any advice on what is best practice using Keras?
