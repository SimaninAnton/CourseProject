The above is a gist of my script I am using to train my model using an HDF5Matrix. I have precomputed convolutional features. I need to train fully connected layers of a VGG net on them.
This is the important part of the script.
The following is the result:
The first time, model is fetching data from HDF5Matrix. The second time from a raw numpy array. Both the models are trained from scratch. You can see how slowly the training proceeds for the first case. (0.2963 after 4 epochs). In the second case, it gives 0.9970 after 4 epochs.
