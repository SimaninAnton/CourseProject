index_generator: For the preprocessing of the images, Index generator in the class with name DirectoryIterator is not defined. Could someone let me know what is the value for self.index_generator. Should I need to define it in the same way as defined in Class Iterator: self.flow_index(). In my work, I need to transfer the data in the small batches and I am reading the files from directory. Thank You1
