I'm not sure if I have non-standard numpy configurations but the github version of examples/cifar10_cnn.py throws:
TypeError: Cannot cast ufunc subtract output from dtype('float64') to dtype('uint8') with casting rule 'same_kind'
on line 239 of keras/preprocessing/image.py which is "X -= self.mean"
This is presumably due to the fact that np.mean(X) returns a float and X is type 'uint8'. I notice that a cast to float occurs in examples/cifar10_cnn.py under data_augmentation == False but not if it's True.
Does this error occur for anyone else?
