As mentioned in #991 and #1024 - by @EderSantana, the current HDF5matrix is only capable of dealing with 2d array. As my input is 4-d (n_sample, n_channel, n_row, n_col), I modified it and am using it like this:
    def shape(self):
        ret = []
        ret.append(self.end - self.start)
        ret = ret + [dim for dim in list(self.data.shape[1:])]
        return tuple(ret)
Would it be helpful to modify Keras' HDF5Matrix in this way? If so, I'd be happy to PR.
