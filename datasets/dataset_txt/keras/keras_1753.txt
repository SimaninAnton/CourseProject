I don't see any way of getting any of the model's attributes, such as seeing a layer's weights and bias, in KerasRegressor. This is unfortunate, as Pipeline is quite convenient, and I'm reluctant to give it up. The closest I can get is getting build_fn. Is there some other way of getting a layer's weights in KerasRegressor that I'm missing?
