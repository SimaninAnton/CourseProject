Hello,
I create a model in Functional API in Keras (Using Theano backend) and would like to get weights from intermediate layer. The main problem is, that this Layer is a multiple Embedding Layer. I am looking for something like this: model.layers[4].get_output_at(1).get_weights(). How can I do this?
