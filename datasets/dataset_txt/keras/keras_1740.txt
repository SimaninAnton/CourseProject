I created a version of non negative constraint for checking and applied it to a layer of trained model as:
   class NonNegmine(Constraint):
       def __call__(self, w):
          w *= K.cast(K.greater_equal(w, 0.), K.floatx())
          return w

   kernel = model.get_layer('existing_layer').kernel
   kernel.constraint = NonNegmine()
After this, I gain recompiled the model and retrained and still there are weights with negative values. Where is the issue
