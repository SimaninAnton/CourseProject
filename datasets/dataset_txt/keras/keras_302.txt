I don't have so much an issue as i have a question, so if this is not the proper place for it my apologies.
I am working with tensorflow 1.13.1 keras 2.1.2 ROS kinetic Ubuntu 16.04, using an RTX 2080 TI.
For a project i am working on i had to include the allow_growth statement for the model to accept its input data. I had to add the line in the tensorflow_backend.py script because I could not get it working with the statement anywhere else. The only references that i have been able to find al simply state that you should use it when to solve a memory problem. The question that i have is in regard to possible downsides to using this statement? Are there any?
