The code "conv_filter_visualization.py" is what I am looking for eagerly, and its results are so amazing. After read the code, I know the meanings of the code in each line. But I don't know the principle or the secret of the method behind the code.
So could someone can provide me some papers or blogs explaining the visualization method for the "conv_filter_visualization.py"?
Thank you very much.
