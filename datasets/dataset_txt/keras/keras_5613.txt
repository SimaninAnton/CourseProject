Hi,
I already know convolution 2d in keras can support map a n*m matrix multiple feature maps according to nb_filter and filter, but it can support the situation like the following:
That means, a value of a feature map after convolution can be computed by different input feature map. Is there a way to achieve it? Thanks very much!
