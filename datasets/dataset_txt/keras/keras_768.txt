hello,
I have been using autoencoder for dimensionality-reduction. I want to know that after pre-training the whole autoencoder, how to use encoded representation and apply SVM for classification.
Although, this issue is similar to one shown in https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/6758 where they used softmax layer to classify.
Would be great help if someone can help me with the matter.
Thanks.
