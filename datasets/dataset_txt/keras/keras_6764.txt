Hi,
I like keras and want to stay with keras, but keras does not have locally connected layers. I've seen pylearn2 has already implemented locally connected layer, but I am not sure how to correctly wrap it in keras. Conceptually this should not be difficult, but I only started theano for 2 weeks... Can anyone help me?
