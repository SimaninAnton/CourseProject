In my self_build model, input layer was defined as below:
len_input = Input(batch_shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int64, name='Length')
Then I try to run model.train_on_batch([mix, mtx, leng], src) (mix, mtx, and leng are 3 input, src is the ground truth, and mix, mtx, src has no concern about this problem)
But got this Error:
Error when checking input: expected Length to have 1 dimensions, but got array with shape (10, 1)
And when I print leng.shape, got (10,) with 10 as my batch_size.
So, here is the problem, I put a (?,) dimension array in an array list as model input, but the model parse it as (?,1) dimension and got an Error.
Or to say, is there other way to give a model multi inputs?
