Hi,
Not really an issue, more an help request or maybe a little issue with callbacks docs.
I was looking into a quick way to save per epoch checkpoints. At the moment I'm using ModelCheckpoint callback with save_best_only=True.
Reading the docs it seems I could just put {epoch:02d} in the filepath to get per epoch checkpoints, but it's not clear how save_best_only is supposed to work in this case, will it be ignored? will the last epoch checkpoint contain the best weights regardless of what happened in that specific epoch?
