    inputs = Input(shape=(3,))
    x = Dense(2)(inputs)
    outputs = Dense(3)(x)

    model = Model(inputs, outputs)
    model.compile(loss=losses.MSE,
                  optimizer=optimizers.Adam(),
                  metrics=['mse'],
                  weighted_metrics=['mse'])
This is due to the model expecting to be fed sample weights (due to the presence of a weighted metric) yet receiving none.
