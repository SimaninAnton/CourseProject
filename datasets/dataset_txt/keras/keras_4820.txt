The kl part of the cost function in the vae example seems to be different than the one from the authors. In particular, it should be :
- 0.5 * K.mean(1 + 2 * z_log_std - K.square(z_mean) -K.square(K.exp(z_log_std)), axis=-1)
Or we can simply imagine the network is estimating z_log_std_squared and change the sampling function to:
return z_mean + K.sqrt(K.exp(z_log_std)) * epsilon
