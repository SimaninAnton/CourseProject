I have a problem in which I have to compile the model inside a loop against compiling outside it without resetting the weights.
model = Sequential()
.
.
.
model.add(Dense(5))
for i in range(episodes):
      model.compile(loss=Customizedloss, optimizer='rmsprop')
      model.fit(x,y)            
My thinking was; when I compile a model inside the loop it should overwrite the previous model to new one having different parameters with previous models weights. But when I run the model it started to use memory exponentially and then ran out of memory very fast. Is it supposed to do this?
