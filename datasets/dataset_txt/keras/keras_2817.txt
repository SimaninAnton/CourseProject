Hi members.
I have been using Keras from a while and noticed an improvement in it. Whenever I used Model Check Point and I am interested in monitoring improved performance I got stuck with a lot of messages "performance didn't change" when my model has slow training rate. There how if we can add verbose = 2 that will only output epochs with improved performance.
Thank you!
