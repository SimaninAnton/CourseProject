Hiï¼ŒI recently found the Tensorflow have a graph visualization called TensorBoard
It's really cool and I think the Keras should have some thing like a Labview,
I mean you can drag and drop a layer into the canvas, connect each other to organise the model Sequence.configure the layer's params in a form.
finally the graph can be export to some python code.
And then what the user need to do is just prepare the data and pass it in the model we just create.
so every user can be a deep learning "expert" :)
Maybe we can gather some people to make it happen.the deep learning will become really really easy for a newbie if he can use this.
