Hi all,
As far as I know, the model.fit( ) updates model parameters for every batch. However, I want my model to update model parameters for every K batch, because my model is big and I can only train a model with batch_size = 1 (otherwise this model cannot be fitted into GPU memory). Of course, my model can still be trained for a single sample batch, but this setting makes my model quickly overfit to training data. Ideally, I want to use batch_size =16. Does anyone know how to set keras to update model parameters for every 16 batches?
