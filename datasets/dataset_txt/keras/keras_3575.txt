Hello,
I am trying to perform a binary classification on vectors of word frequencies, ie. a bag of words. When I try to run the code I receive the following error: ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.
My X_train and Y_train variables are numpy arrays. X_train is a 2D numpy array where each row represents a single document's word frequencies. And Y_train are the classifications (either a 0 or 1) for each document. num_features represents the length of the word frequency vectors, ie the amount of columns in X_train.
My code is outlined below:
model = Sequential([ Dense(64, input_dim =num_features), Activation('relu'), Dense(1), Activation('softmax') ])
model.compile(optimizer = 'rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, nb_epoch=5, batch_size = 32)
It looks like the error occurs when I compile my model at: model.fit(X_train, Y_train, nb_epoch=5, batch_size = 32)
Thanks so much!
