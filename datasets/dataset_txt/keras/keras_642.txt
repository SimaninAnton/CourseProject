Hello ï¼Œ I want to ask if the version of keras has an impact on the results of my network operation. I wrote a residual network, adding some modules I wrote myself, with the goal of doing a second classification. But I found that when my version of keras is different, the predicted results are different. I used the same configuration on the same computer, and the weight I load is the same. Only the version of keras is different. I used keras2.2.4 and 2.1.2. So I want to ask, the different versions of keras will affect the results of my network predictions?
