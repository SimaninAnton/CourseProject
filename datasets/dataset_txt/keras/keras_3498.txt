Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
On Ubuntu, when I install keras by pip install, examples directory is missing. Other kinds of sdk, say, jdk, installs examples when I choose to install it.
It seems that the only way to get examples is to clone or view the repository which might not be convenient to the people learning technology. There can be people who doesn't know what git clone is as an example.
To resolve this problem can we make pip install keras also installs examples?
Thanks
