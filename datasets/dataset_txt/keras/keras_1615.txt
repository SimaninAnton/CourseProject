I'm new to keras and just follow the tutorial to learn it.
This is the post that I'm learning right now, Using pre-trained word embeddings in a Keras model, https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html
In the phase of building model, a piece of code is written like the following,
from keras.layers import Input
sequence_input = Input(shape=(MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH,), dtype='int32')
But I can't find Input class in keras documentation. So what is the purpose of Input class, and in which module can I find it?
Thank you.
