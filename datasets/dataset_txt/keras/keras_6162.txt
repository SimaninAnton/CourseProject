I think using the step function that uses the Theano rnn function may cause a crash sometimes.
I experienced many crashes when used a relu activation and when increasing the number of hidden units in the TimeDistributedDense layer (e.g. 128 -> 512)
I solved it simply by replacing the 'rnn' function with my implementation.
Did anyone encounter such a problem?
