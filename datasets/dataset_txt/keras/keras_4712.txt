Hi guys,
I'm trying to switch from Theano to TF backend, and here's a quick question. When I use TF code inside a Layer, say I use the following pseudo code to use TF built in RNNs:
# in __init__()
self.fw_cell = rnn_cell.GRUCell(self.n_hid)
self.bw_cell = rnn_cell.GRUCell(self.n_hid)
...
# in call()
output_lst, _, _ = rnn.bidirectional_rnn(self.fw_cell, self.bw_cell, x, dtype=floatX)
I'm pretty sure that some matrices inside cells need to be initialized, then my question is:
When should I do the tf.initialize_variables(), or how to use keras init methods to init TF rnn_cell (or any other TF stuff)?
