The current documentation does not show arguments declaration of objects. E.g., it's like this now
predict_generator()
, while it used to be
predict_generator(generator, steps, max_q_size=something, ..)
With the current format, people don't know if each argument is required, or optional (keyword argument), and what's the default value. Is there some reason for this, or do you want to modify it to the previous format?
