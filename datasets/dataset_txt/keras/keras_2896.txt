Hi.
I have 100 similar simlest networks with 5x2x1 layers and simplest architecture which has the same trainset.
How can I train them in simultaneous mode using GPU?
P.S. For example, we have 10 000 input vectors with 16 components.
Maeby it will be necesarry to change activation and perf functions, but now let's take that they are tanh and mse.
