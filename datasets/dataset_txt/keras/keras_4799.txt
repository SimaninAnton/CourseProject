The validation data and test data in this example are the same. It's probably better to have separate val and test data.
Or maybe I misunderstand the purpose of validation data here, and it's just to see how the model improves on the test data. As long as you don't use the val results to select the best model, and as long as you don't train multiple models to look for the best model, then maybe it's OK?
