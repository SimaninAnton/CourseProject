I want to approximate a function f(x)=x^2 and I use the following code.
model = Sequential()
model.add(MaxoutDense(output_dim=1,nb_feature=3,input_dim=1))
model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer=SGD(lr=0.001, momentum=0.4, nesterov=True))
model.fit(x_train, y, nb_epoch=20, batch_size=2)
I referred to this article Maxout Networks, when I finished the training I thought there should be 3 lines, like the image in this article's example, but I just found 2 linesf(x) = -6x and f(x) = 6x, and all of them pass through the point (0,0).
I guess there are 3 lines, I didn't find the 3rd line cause they don't have a bias term?
