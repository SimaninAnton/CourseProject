Hi
During train a Keras model, the training output looks like as follows
4375/4375 [==============================] - 821s - loss: 0.1497 - acc: 0.9749
I know loss is for the cost, but what does “acc” mean here. In the training setup, I did not include the validation split. Therefore, I am not very clear the meaning of “acc” here. Thanks.
