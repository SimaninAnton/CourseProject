Hi -
I am trying to modify the GRU code to handle a fixed scalar vector of the same length as the number of time sequences.
Basically in the step code, I want to modify the returned h to be a weighted average of the new h and the old h.
h = self.g[i] * h + (1 - self.g[i])*h_tm1
I want i to represent the time step of the GRU but am unable to figure out how to access that index i. I am instantiating my GRU by passing in a scalar vector g.
Any and all help would be much appreciated!
