I have a script here that
Creates a model
Saves the model by creating a json_string with my_model.to_json and then writing the json_string to a file.
Reloads the model from that file using model_from_json.
The current version of this gist runs and reloads the model fine. But uncommenting lines 25-26 causes an exception when you try and reload the model.The error message is Missing layer: end_img.
This was especially surprising since the line that you uncomment seems not to have any relation to the layer in that error message.
