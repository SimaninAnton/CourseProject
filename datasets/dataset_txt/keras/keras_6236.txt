Who is down for a Keras deep net entry to the Data Science Bowl? https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl
I am not interested in the prize money, so you can have that if that's what you're into. I'm interested in seeing Keras used for state of the art applications.
I can contribute in advising, as well as some coding. I am generally quite busy so other people would to handle most of the work. I also have code lying around for distributed hyperparameter optimization with Keras...
