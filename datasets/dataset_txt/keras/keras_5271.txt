Hi,
I just finished to train my first RNN with keras, but I have two small technical problems. I have several Warning Messages because apparently something is slowing down my training phase.
The first problem is 'TimeDistributedDense()'. Apparently is deprecated and I am supposed to use 'TimeDistributed(Dense(...))' instead, as suggested by the warning msg itself. When I surf into keras documentation this method is cited in section 'Core', but the code line:
from keras.layers.core import TimeDistributed
gives me an error. How am I suposed to import TimeDistributed?
The second problem is 'on_batch_end()'. The original warning msg is the following:
Warning (from warnings module):
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/callbacks.py", line 66
% delta_t_median)
UserWarning: Method on_batch_end() is slow compared to the batch update (0.122654). Check your callbacks
I found another post here about this problem but people were saying that is due to heavy custom callbacks, but I didn't define any callback by my own. So what could be the problem?
