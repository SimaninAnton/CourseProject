Now it is possible to configure and build tensorflow with OpenCL support (since https://github.com/benoitsteiner/tensorflow-opencl was merged into TF). So, providing device parameter like for theano, e.g. "device": "opencl0:0" or "device": "opencl" gives nothing:
simple run pytest3 (already read about right testing, it's just for showing device type)
