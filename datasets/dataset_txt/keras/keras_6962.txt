Apologies if this has already been asked, couldn't find anything though. But do you have the capability to utilize multiple objective functions, say a "Split" similar to "Merge"? The goal would be to implement a model like the one given here:

That is, have a classifier and a regression objective function that both provide gradient information to backprop.
