Google Research has just published there up-to-date achievements in deep learning http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html. They have created beautiful arts by leveraging ConvNets. Yesterday, they also make their code public available https://github.com/google/deepdream which is based on Caffe. I am just wondering if we can create such arts based on keras?
