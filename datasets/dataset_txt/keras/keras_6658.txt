I'm trying to load a model previously saved to a yaml file.
I'm getting following error.
__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dims'
The only dims in the yaml is:
-  dims: !!python/tuple [500, 16]
   name: Reshape
This corresponds to a (Sequential) model.add(Reshape(500,16)) in the original specification. I notice two potential issues, one is lack of brackets around layer and lack of a comma between the dims and name, and the other is the *args interface of Reshape. Not being familiar with yaml, I'm not sure if latter is a problem, but manually editing yaml to:
- {dims: !!python/tuple [500, 16] , name: Reshape}
continues to give same error.
Suggestions?
Thanks!
