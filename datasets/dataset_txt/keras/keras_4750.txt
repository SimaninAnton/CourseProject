I have built an auto-encoder consisting of a single hidden layer (hence, two weights and two biases to be learned). I want to impose weight tying, that is to force the network to learn the same weight matrix for input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output transformations.
I wonder how this can be implemented in Keras.
thanks,
Hadi
