So I've been playing around with regenerative modeling using RNNs and I've been wondering the following:
Assuming an input of size (1000, 25, 15) where 1000 is the samples, 25 is the sequences per sample and 15 are the features per sequence. I am predicting the next sequence as output and it works well. Now if I wanted to predict further in the future I could feed the next prediction as an input and go on for as long as I want. My question is, could I train a model based on n_number of sequences as y_train? E.g instead of getting for outputs (1000, 1, 15), to get as output (1000, 25, 15) therefore training a model to predict a number of future sequences. I have already hacked something together that does that but not in the nicest of ways. Basically I train 15 models, one for each feature that all predict the next 25 outputs for that value and then I stitch them together. Does keras support a way of doing this without having to train a gazillion models each time? Thanks for your time.
