Hi All,
I have been working on writing an implementation of Frame-Recurrent Video Super-Resolution
I find it very easy to implement the CNN by stacking the layers as described in the paper. However, the writer mentioned that he train the network by providing a sequence of 10 images. To my understanding that can be done using TimeDistributed (Please correct me If I'm wrong).
However, how can I use the output of a single CNN in the TimeDistributed to be the input of the next fold of the CNN?
I'd be thankful if someone provided any information or links regarding implementing recurrent CNNs in the same approach described by the author.
