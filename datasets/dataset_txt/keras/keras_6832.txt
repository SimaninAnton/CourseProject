Hi,
Looking at this Torch tutorial:
http://code.madbits.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorial_basics
A Spatial Convolution layer is generated, and its weights are visualized,
then Lena's image is forwarded through the layer and the resulting images are visualized.
It would be nice if Keras would support the visualization of both things (aka include the visualization in its tutorials).
