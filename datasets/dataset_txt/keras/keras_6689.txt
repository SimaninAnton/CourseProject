I'm currently trying to implement the GoogLeNet using a Graph model and Convolution2D.
model.fit(...) results in the following error:
ValueError: GpuJoin: Wrong inputs for input 1 related to inputs 0.!
Apply node that caused the error: GpuJoin(...
...
Inputs shapes: [(), (500, 16, 24, 24), (500, 32, 24, 24), (500, 64, 24, 24), (500, 16, 24, 24)]
that suggests that the merging of the 4 convolution outputs is not done according to the 2nd dimension.
According to
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/containers.py#L227
a Merge Layer is used for add_output and this one concatenates according to axis -1
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L197
would it be ok to change that to axis=1? or would that cause other problems? Then maybe the axis should be a parameter?
