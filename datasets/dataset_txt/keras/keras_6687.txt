Current values for model.param[i].name is None. When inspecting the created model it is hard to figure out what is what.
For now I am doing
self.params = [self.W, self.b]
self.W.name = "Dense W"
self.b.name = "Dense b"
but I guess this should be done better.
I saw Layer.set_name but:
a) It does not keep the naming W and b
b) Would break the usual model.add(Convolution2D(32, 32, 3, 3))
c) Is not called by default
What about being able to do
model.add(Convolution2D(32, 32, 3, 3, name="conv5"))
so that parameters names end up being conv5.W and conv5.b; and if name is None (default) then have them named (by default) as Convolution2D.W and Convolution2D.b ?
