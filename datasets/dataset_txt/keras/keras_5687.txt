Hi, I have a question about the input of LSTM layer.
The Keras Document says that the input data should be 3D tensor with shape (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim). In my LSTM model, I set the timesteps as 50, but the model doesn't perform well. Is there any range limitations of 'timesteps'? Like smaller than a number ?
Can LSTM layer can use all the time information of each sequence?
Thank you in advance!
