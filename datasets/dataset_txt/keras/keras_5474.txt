Attempting to serialize a model containing L1 or L2 weight regularization to YAML will blowup as the the get_config method of WeightRegularizer returns l1 and l2 as NumPy ndarrays. For instance, the following snippet will result in yaml.dump raising a TypeError when it tries to serialize the arrays:
import yaml
from keras.regularizers import WeightRegularizer
reg = WeightRegularizer(l1=0.0, l2=0.01)
yaml.dump(reg.get_config())
