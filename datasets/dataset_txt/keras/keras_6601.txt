Hi,
I started using Keras recently and it is really great!
I needed to use an Average Pooling in my project, so I had to write my own custom class, because apparently Keras supports only Max function. I started actually wondering whether this option could be built in Keras?
In MaXPooling2D class the following method is being called:
output = downsample.max_pool_2d(X, ds=self.poolsize, st=self.stride, ignore_border=self.ignore_border)
and max_pool_2d actually supports different modes
mode ({‘max’, ‘sum’, ‘average_inc_pad’, ‘average_exc_pad’}) – Operation executed on each window. max and sum always exclude the padding in the computation. average gives you the choice to include or exclude it.
