What I want to do is as follows:
conv = Convolution2D(..)
output_1 = conv(input)
output_2 = conv(output_1)
such that the conv here are the same layer with the same weights. Normally if one add 2 Convolution2D, it will be 2 different layers with different weights.
Is it possible to do what I mention in keras?
Thanks.
