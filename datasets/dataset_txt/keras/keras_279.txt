Hi!
first of all I'm new to this so any help would be highly appreciated.
Now i've been stuck at this issue (can be seen in the last screenshot [ValueError: The model expects 0 input arrays, but only received one array. Found: array with shape (646, 229, 229, 3)
]) for about a week now.
#6062 this problem is similar to mine but this solution isn't working for me. these are screenshot of my code. So kindly point out where the problem is.
