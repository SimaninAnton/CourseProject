I have a csv file with two columns "Review" and "Sentiment"
I am cleaned up the data in column "Review"
I am trying to apply an LSTM model on the data:
I have zero padded my input data "Review" so that trainX and testX have same length
max_Review_length = 100 
embedding_vecor_length = 32
top_words = 100   

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(top_words, embedding_vecor_length, input_length=max_Review_length))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(20))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
print(model.summary())
I get the following error:
