In applications.resnet50 there is an averagepooling layer at the end of the convolution layers. However in the "include_top" layers there is the option of adding globalaveragepooling or globalmaxpooling.
It makes no sense to do averagepooling then globalaveragepooling. Therefore the averagepooling is superfluous.
