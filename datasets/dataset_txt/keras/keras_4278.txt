I just reinstall my OS and setup the latest version of ML environment and I found that 1.1.0 version costs triple training time than 1.0.1 version in mnist_cnn.py and double training time in cifar10_cnn.py. I change different versions of Theano and cuDNN. I can sure that it is the issue of Keras. What are the changes casing this situation? Thanks.
