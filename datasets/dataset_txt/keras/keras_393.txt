Can anyone guide me how can I use reshape function?
encoded (?, 4)
encod (?, 2)
normalize (?, 2)
Complex_symbols (?,)
decode(?,)
concat (?, 2)
deco (?, 4)
decod (?, 4)
I have size (None,) in 2 layers decode and concat where I need the size to be (None,1)
how should I use a Reshape function in this case? Or is there any other option
