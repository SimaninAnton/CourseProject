I have used Keras for not so long, but here's the thing.
If you create several models in one script, then you are starting to get multiple output during training, like this (5th model in one session):
Epoch 4
Epoch 4
Epoch 4
Epoch 4
Epoch 4
1664/7000 [======>.......................] - ETA: 116s - loss: 0.4524
After the epoch has ended you alse get several full progressbars. I tried to find the source of problem, but I'm not so acquainted with Keras code. Looks like the problem is somewhere in the callbacks mechanism, but I can't be sure.
