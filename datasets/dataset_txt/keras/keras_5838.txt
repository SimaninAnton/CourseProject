I was trying to make nonlinear regression using Keras. However the result is far from satisfying. I was wondering how should I choose the Layers to build the NN and how to tuning the parameters like Activations, Objectives and others. Is there any principles or guide materials to address this problem? I am newcomer to deep learning and really need help here. The NN I built is as followes
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(input_dim = 4, output_dim = 500))
model.add(Activation('tanh'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(input_dim = 500, output_dim = 1))
model.add(Activation('tanh'))
model.compile(loss='mean_absolute_error', optimizer='rmsprop')
Thanks~`
