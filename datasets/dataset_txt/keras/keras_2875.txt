Hi,
I have a time series data as 2D array which I want to give as an input to the LSTM and my problem is that LSTM needs a 3D array as input. Suppose my data is a sequence of n rows with m features and I want to train on k timesteps, is there a way to feed it the data without redundant shifting and copying each row k times?
BR.
