Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
[ x] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[ x] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
[x ] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
As per the documentation, if the output from a Convolution2D is (batch, x, y, numfilters), then to get numfilters parameters for the PReLU layer, one should set shared_axes=(1,2). But this can result in an incorrect number of parameters:

Possible fixes include
Changing documentation to read (0,1) instead of (1,2)
or
Lines 82-83 in advanced_activations.py should use i-1 instead of i
