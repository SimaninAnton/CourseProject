Hi,
I am trying to have a layer with a very simple function. I want to set the K smallest entries in a vector to zero. For example, when K = 2 and the input vector is (1,2,3,4,5), the output will be (0,0,3,4,5). Conceptually this is very simple, but I am wondering if there is an existing tool in Keras for this, or if there is an easy way to realize such a function. I looked at Masking and Pooling layers, but they don't seem to be relevant.
Thanks,
Chuyang
