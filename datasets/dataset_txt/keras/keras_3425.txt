I have the code like this:
        layer = TimeDistributed(Dense(node_num,activation=act_type),input_shape=(in_len,in_dim))
and then it pop up the warning like this:
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/keras/engine/topology.py:368: UserWarning: The regularizers property of layers/models is deprecated. Regularization losses are now managed via the losses layer/model property. warnings.warn('The regularizers property of '
I recently update the software. Could anyone tell me how can I get rid of this warning?
Thank you very much!
