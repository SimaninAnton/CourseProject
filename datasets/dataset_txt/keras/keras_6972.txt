Hi guys, I love this project very much but not familiar with theano.
My real question is to implement the architecture of https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence:
the simplified pipeline is Embedding -> Merge(cnns) -> Dense
Merge acts similar as FeatureUnion in sklearn here, Embedding' W need to be changeable.
While using Keras, I meet this question Could Merge connect previous layer?
Merge's super is Object rather than Layer, so it must be the first 'layer'?
I change Merge's super to Layer, but it raises  **DisconnectedInputError** when compiling
DisconnectedInputError: grad method was asked to compute the gradient with respect to a variable that is not part of the computational graph of the cost, or is used only by a non-differentiable operator: <TensorType(float64, matrix)>
