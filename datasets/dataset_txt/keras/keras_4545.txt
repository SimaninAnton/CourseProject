I want to use Keras as a high-level front for Tensorflow. I export the TF graph, reduce it only to the inference part and then deploy it.
The problem is that I want the names of nodes in the TF graph to be deterministic. i.e. if I create a keras layer Activation('softmax', name="output") I want there to be a node named output in the TF graph. (or at least something like softmax_output_1)
This does not happen, because Keras backend softmax(x) does not take a name parameter. I presume that the reason behind this is that while TF does allow you to name your nodes, theano does not (or at least it seemed so when I checked theano softmax).
I understand that this might not be something you want, i.e. being able to name nodes only in one backend if the other does not support it, however it seems very useful and should not actually harm theano users.
I would like to contribute this functionality if it is not something you totally disagree with.
