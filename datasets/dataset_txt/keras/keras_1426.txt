Hi all,
I went through the implementation of the xception network in Keras and it seems that the convolution layers regularization is set to the default which is None.
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/xception.py
This is inconsistent with the paper which states a L2 regularization for the convolution layers.

Am I missing something?
Thanks!
