A few questions regarding the operations on the output of a LSTM hidden layer
Code:
input1 = Input(shape=(100,),dtype='int32',name='input')
input2 = Input(shape=(100,),dtype='int32',name='input')
embedding=Embedding(output_dim=300,input_dim=102, mask_zero=True)
e=embedding(input)
f_rnn = LSTM(259,return_sequences=True, dropout_U=0.2, consume_less='mea')

lstm_output_1=f_rnn(e)
lstm_output_2=f_rnn(e)
dot_product=merge([lstm_output_1,K.transpose(lstm_output_2)],mode='dot')
The output shape of the f_rnn is (None,100, 259), hence the shape of the lstm_output_1 and lstm_output_2 would be the same. Now when I perform the K.transpose on the lstm_output_2, what would be the shape of the transposed tensor?
When the mode='dot' is applied, which axes are considered for the dot product? Does it take one sample at a time?
