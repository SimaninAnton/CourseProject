I am using pretrained CNN model built using keras to get predictions on image data. The first time I hit the function, predict() to get the model prediction, it takes a log time to produce results. From the second time on, it produces the results pretty quick. Any idea what the issue is?
Models and weights are loaded already in the memory before I pass the image object for prediction.
Thanks!
