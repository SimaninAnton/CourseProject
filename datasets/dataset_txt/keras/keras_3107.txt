I tried, but as an output i get a vector of 300 dim, whereas i should be getting a single score as a distance between two tensors
from scipy.spatial.distance import cityblock
def Manahtten_distance(M):
A=M[0]
B=M[1]
res=cityblock(A,B)
return res
merged_vector = merge([encoded_a, encoded_b],mode=Manahtten_distance, output_shape=(1,))
