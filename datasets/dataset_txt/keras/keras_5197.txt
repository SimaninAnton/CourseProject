Hello!
New to Keras, looking for information on how to prepare a dataset of images + labels for Keras? Is Pickle the best way? HDF5? Or can they be created using actual directory paths? I'm aware that datasets are just numpy arrays of data and labels, but any information on the creation of a new dataset for Keras would be very helpful.
