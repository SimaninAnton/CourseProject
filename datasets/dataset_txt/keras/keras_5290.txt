There are a lot of open issues concerning the API changes from 0.3.2 to 1.0.1

APIs change all the time, but if the new API is going to have a different functionality from the old one and is not going to support the legacy API, it should either follow a different naming scheme or detect the legacy code and throw.
In both case, a code based on legacy API should fail with a valid error.
