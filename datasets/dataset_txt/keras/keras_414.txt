Hello all,
I have found useful sometimes to have a layer which just stores some value and does nothing more. It could be useful when you need to output multiple values from one layer or for debug purposes. I haven't found this in Keras documentation and/or source code, so I've written on myself:
class Store(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(Store, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, x, mask=None):
        return x

    def compute_mask(self, input_tensor, mask=None):
        return None

    def get_output_shape_for(self, input_shape):
        return input_shape

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return input_shape
Hope it will be useful for someone else.
