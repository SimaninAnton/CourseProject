Hi, I am confused about a very simple operation. I have some output A of shape (None,15,200), and the 15 is the timestep. I have anoter vector B of shape(None, 15), each dimension of B is the weight value of the 200-D representation of each time step . I wanted to multiply A with B, which means a weighted output of shape(None, 15, 200), how can i compute this in Keras? It is a basic operation in Keras , sorry about not knowing that. Thx so much!
