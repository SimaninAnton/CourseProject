keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16(...) and other models in keras.applications require a working internet connection, since the pre-trained weights are internally downloaded from the web. I suggest to add an optional path parameter, such that the weights can also be loaded from a local source if the internet connection is blocked by a firewall.
