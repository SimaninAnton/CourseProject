How to implement dbn in keras
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_set
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
