I saw a similar issue posted but it has been closed and I didn't see a resolution. So opening fresh.
The above error occurs when adding a Dense layer to any of the recurrent layers.
For example very simple things that used to work fine in the older version like...
model = Sequential()
model.add(GRU(128))
model.add(Dense(1))
..now produce this error
Is there a workaround besides downgrading?
