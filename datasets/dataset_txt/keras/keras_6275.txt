In the example at:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py
The output is integer and after predicting, we need to round the output to have a prediction.
Is there a way to use this example with categorical output, instead of converting categorical to integer and then convert back?
