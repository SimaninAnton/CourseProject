I have been trying to train a Resnet50 model , though the training begins , i get the warning above. The keras 2.2.0 documentation indicates an argument like this. Am i doing something wrong??
I have initialised my model like this
base_model = resnet50.ResNet50(include_top=False,
weights='imagenet',
input_shape=(img_width,img_height,3),
classes=2,
pooling=None)
