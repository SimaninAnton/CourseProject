I want to concatenate feature maps from lower layers and upper layers, and then input the concatenated feature map to the fully connected layer. The feature map of lower layers and upper layers will in different shapes, so should I use a pooling layer or just flatten them in order to concatenate them? How to do this in Keras? THX!
