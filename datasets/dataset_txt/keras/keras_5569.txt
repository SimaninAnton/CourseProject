The trainable attribute seems to be broken in Keras 1.
From the Layer docstring:
trainable: boolean, whether the layer weights will be updated during training. 
Sadly the trainable attribute has no effect. For example both Convolution2D and Dense layers
set always trainable_weights ignoring the trainable attribute.
My solution would be to rename the trainable_weights member to _trainable_weights
and then add this method:
@property
def trainable_weights(self):
    if self.trainable:
        return self._trainable_weights
    else:
        return []
If you are fine with my solution, I can get a pull request ready.
