I'm relatively new to Keras - have had some simple Dense() networks working previously but on using it to explore CNNs I find the documentation intractable.
Please can we have one webpage that lists the meaning of all the parameters:
samples
channels
nb_filter
filter_length
batch_size
input_shape
and in particular, the relationships of requirements between them all with examples of how one should reshape a 2D numpy array to make it suitable?
I have managed to create a 1-layer CNN that does something but a) I can't be confident what it does and b) having fudged the nb_filter parameter to make it work as the first layer, attempts to daisy-chain a second layer give shape mismatch errors. To debug this, I need a simple page that explains the terms Keras uses.
Thanks
