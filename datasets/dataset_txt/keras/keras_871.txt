I want to share variable between 2 layers, If I implement with pure tensorflow. I can do this:
        with tf.variable_scope("model", reuse=True):
            h = tf.variable(xxx, name=yyy)
put these 2 layer under same variable scope with same name and set reuse=True. But if I want to use layers from keras, for example:
keras.layers.Dense
It doesn't work. in the graph, tensorflow will create 2 sets of variables.
How Can implement this with keras?
