I've a sequential model as follows with a linear activation function (Keras default) for the single output neuron:
model = Sequential()
model.add( ...
...
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))
I need the final number to be bounded by 100, so I modified the last line of code above to be:
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x%100, output_shape=(1)))
1- Is it correct? Does x here means the net as I expect ?
2- I get an error: "In Lambda, output_shape must be a list, a tuple, or a function".
