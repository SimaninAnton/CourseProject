Hello,
I have a small issue/suggestion. While training a deep learning network, it would be quite helpful if:
[1] As of now lets say I run for 20 epochs, but on seeing the validation error I know my model achieved the best performance at 10 epochs. Ideally I would re-run with full data, uptill 10 epochs. However, it might be good if the best validation model is saved in memory and one can have an option, either to predict with the model at last epoch or the one with best validation error?
I saw this as a feature somewhere, but I think this is not yet supported in Keras?
Ofcourse, once could run for 5 epochs save the model and the validation error rate, and run again with new initialization for next 5 epochs and so on. I am going to try this option, but would have been great if using pre-trained model was given as an example?
[2] In the output, it would also return the data logged for validation and training error. This would be useful to compare diff. architectures by plotting them
