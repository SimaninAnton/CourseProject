When I run the example script provided here, the program just terminates after the first call to add() (line 17 in the script). I observe the same behavior with my own scripts: The first call of add() kills the program. No exception is thrown, no error message is shown, the program just terminates with exit code 0xC0000005. Everything worked fine before I installed cuDNN (and still works if I disable cuDNN), just very slowly.
Here is my setup:
OS: 64-bit Windows 10
Graphics card: Nvidia GeForce GT 730
Python: Python 2.7.13 (Anaconda 4.4.0 64-bit)
Keras: 2.0.6
Theano: 0.9.0
CUDA: 8.0.60
cuDNN: 5.1
Graphics driver: NVIDIA Graphics Driver 376.51
My .theanorc:
[global]
floatX = float32
device = cuda0

[lib]
cnmem = 0.2

[cuda]
root = C:/Users/alt/Tools/cuda

[dnn]
library_path = C:/Users/alt/Tools/cuda/lib/x64
include_path = C:/Users/alt/Tools/cuda/include
Script output:
Using Theano backend.
Using cuDNN version 5110 on context None
Mapped name None to device cuda0: GeForce GT 730 (0000:01:00.0)
and then the process dies. Is this a known issue? Could it be a problem with my setup?
