Hi,
I am trying to implement the Learned Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA) proposed in Gregor and LeCun 2010, "Learning Fast Approximations of Sparse Coding". LISTA aims to solve a sparse reconstruction problem using the network structure as shown in the figure.

Here W and S are to be learned from training data. Note that the matrix S at different "layers" should have the same parameters. My first thought is to use a Graph model with shared nodes. However, to define the shared node S, its second input (z2) should be defined first. But z2 is not defined until S is defined. Thus, defining S is problematic using this approach.
I am wondering if there is some way to work around the problem and allow the S in the two stages to have the same weights.
Thank you,
Chuyang
