Hi I am trying to implement a bidirectional layer, with layer returning a sequence. I would like to confirm if the output returned by setting go_backwards flag = True, also reverses the generated output or not?
As far I can see in the source code, it does not. So i changed a line in the call function of recurrrent class, as
if self.return_sequences:
if self.go_backwards:
return outputs[:,::-1,:]
else:
return outputs
else:
return last_output
Is this fine, to ensure that output is timereversed. I am later using the output to concatenate with the forward layer as :
merge([forward,backward], mode='concat', concat_axis=-1)
