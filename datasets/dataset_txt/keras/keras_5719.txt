I read other threads and understand how to model the problem with the various layers. But, when I call
model.fit(X, Y .....)
What should X and Y be?
For example, if actually I am mapping sentences (for machine translation), does X need to be embeddings and Y just one hot representations?
Is there a code example that does such word to word-based sequence generation using RNN?
