Hello!
I'm having an issue with Keras giving me and error of "Graph disconnected", while I think the graph is not really disconnected...
I've got a certain network doing some features extraction:
net = Conv Conv Conv...
net = Flatten()(net)
I then want to calculate the parameters of a Gaussian function using a Dense layer. This Gaussian function will be used in parallel with the rest of the network:
gauss_par = Dense(2, activation='relu')(net)
# Define a vector from 1 to n_frames
x1d = K.tf.range(0, n_frames, dtype='float32')
# Transform the vector into a tensor of shape [batch_size, n_frames]
x = K.tf.tile(K.tf.reshape(x1d, [1, -1]), [K.tf.shape(inputs)[0], 1])
# Gaussian function
gaussian = K.tf.exp(-K.tf.pow(x - gauss_par[:, 0], 2) / 2 / K.tf.pow(gauss_par[:, 1], 2))
# Transform the tensorflow tensor into a keras tensor
gaussian_layer = Input(tensor=gaussian, name='tf')
This gaussian_layer is then multiplied with the rest of the network.
The error I'm getting is:
RuntimeError: Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor Tensor("Exp_2:0", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32) at layer "tf". The following previous layers were accessed without issue: ['input_1']
It looks like keras is unable to see the tensorflow tensor which is generated as input. I'm really sure I even need to use the Input layer to transform the tensorflow tensor into a keras tensor, but that's what I've found in the doc. Am I doing this wrong?
Thank you,
Alessandro
