New release of TensorFlow (API r.1.2) incorporates Keras to great extent. However, TimeDistributed layer has disappeared. I wonder if one should rewrite existing code (use Keras 2.0.5) with new syntax, i.e., model = tf.contrib.keras.models.Sequential() instead of model = Sequential() ?? Another question, is there compatibility between tf.contrib.keras.layers.LSTM and tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell in the new TensorFlow??
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
