Hi all,
I would like to convert the tensor with shape=(128, 128) to 1D list of tensor value to use it later for tf.spare.SpareTensor.
I was trying to run the following code:
x = tf.zeros([128,128])
y = tf.reshape(x,-1)
But I got error: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'Reshape' (op: 'Reshape') with input shapes: [128,128], [].
Thanks in advance.
