For my application i need 2 output from the trained network (one at final layer and one at intermediate layer). Since model.predict() gives output from only last layer, i wrote theano function to fetch output at both intermediate layer and final layer. It works fine, but it is almost 20 times slower as compared to model.predict().
Can anybody help me to understand why theano function is slower and how can i make it faster.
