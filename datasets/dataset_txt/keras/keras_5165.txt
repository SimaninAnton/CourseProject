I have an RNN which receives a sequence input of shape (nb_samples, nb_timesteps, input_dim). I want to pass an additional input of shape (nb_samples, controller_dim) which would be used just to set the initial hidden and cell state for each batch.
I can write this entire LSTM as a custom layer but is there a better way to do this? Is there any way to do this by sub-classing the Keras LSTM class? I am feeling reluctant to merge these two inputs as I would again have to override each method which receives the input and then un-merge them inside.
