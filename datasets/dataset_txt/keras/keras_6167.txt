Im trying to use Keras in a setting where the output is piped to another application. However, in keras/backend/init.py the active backend in use is printed to stdout.
One solution would be to be able to configure keras not to print anything or alternatively print to stderr instead, e.g., print('Using TensorFlow backend.', file=sys.stderr).
Any fix would be appreciated.
