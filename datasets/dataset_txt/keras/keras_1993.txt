Model created with tf.contrib.keras integration cannot be loaded as keras model while the other way around it works - TF 1.2.1, Keras 2.0.5 master. Maybe it should work like that - that kind of integrations and code alignment is hard to maintain.
Reproduction: https://gist.github.com/kretes/bb88be26a48235f77ac901898065b4c1
In general - what is the suggested way of working with keras after it is integrated in TF? work on keras with TF backend or work on tf.contrib.keras?
[v] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[v] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
[v] If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
[v] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
