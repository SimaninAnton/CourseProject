if axis == -1, then line 507 will be
broadcastable = x.broadcastable[:-1] + x.broadcastable[0:]
and will not remove @@Correctly?
504 def squeeze(x, axis):
505 '''Remove a 1-dimension from the tensor at index "axis".
506 '''
507 broadcastable = x.broadcastable[:axis] + x.broadcastable[axis+1:]
508 x = T.patternbroadcast(x, [i == axis for i in range(x.type.ndim)])
509 x = T.squeeze(x)
510 x = T.patternbroadcast(x, broadcastable)
511 return x
