Considering is has nothing to do with deconvolution (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution) and how TensorFlow now is calling "deconvolution" transposed convolution (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn.html#conv2d_transpose) shouldn't the DeconvolutionND layers in Keras be renamed to TransposedConvolutionND or similarly? It's very confusing.
