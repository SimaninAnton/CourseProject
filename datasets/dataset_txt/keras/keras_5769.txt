Does Keras support complex numbers? For example, given FFT data, is there a natural way of including both the magnitudes and phases of the FFT?
My current model looks like this, but only handles magnitudes at the moment:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(input_dim=n, output_dim=n, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(input_dim=n, output_dim=n, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(input_dim=n, output_dim=n, return_sequences=True))
model.add(TimeDistributedDense(input_dim=n, output_dim=n))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='rmsprop')
Is it sensible to double the input pattern size and just input all bins' magnitudes and phases as floats? Does this preserve the structure of the complex numbers or would it turn out completely bonkers?
