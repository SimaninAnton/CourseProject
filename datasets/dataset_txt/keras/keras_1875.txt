I want to add an UpSampling1D but it seems it only accepts fixed-length input. Is there any chance to get it to work for variable-length input? Other layers work perfectly for my model.
Part of my model:
inp = Input(shape=(None,161),name="in")
zeropadded = ZeroPadding1D(padding=1)(inp)
upsampled = UpSampling1D(length=2)(zeropadded)
I get the following error:
ValueError: Axis 1 of input tensor should have a defined dimension, but is None. Full tensor shape: (None, None, 161). Typically you need to pass a fully-defined `input_shape` argument to your first layer.
