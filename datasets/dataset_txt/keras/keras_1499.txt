Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
This is a short and simple issue. Following upgrading to Keras 2.0.9 I have been using the multi_gpu_model utility but I can seem to save my models or best weights using model.save.
The error I get is
TypeError: can’t pickle module objects
I suspect there is some problem gaining access to the model object. Is there a work around this issue?
