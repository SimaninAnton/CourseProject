I am working on using CNN to perform image categorization. There are 10 categories of images each of them has about 300-500 images. During training, it is observed that the training accuracy (close to 90%) is much higher than the validation accuracy (about 30%, only better than random guess), indicating a severe overfitting issue. I have randomly selected 80% of images per category for training and the rest for validation.
Is there any strategies to avoid or mitigate the overfitting issue, and meanwhile to improve the validation performance. I have tried to use early stopping, but the testing accuracy is still very low.
