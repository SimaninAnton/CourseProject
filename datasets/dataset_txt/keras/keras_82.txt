I have trained a model using keras and want to use it's pb model file to predict online.
The pb model must be called using tensor's name.
But the output tensor name will be renamed with it's layer's name + "/" + activation name.
training code like:
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(output_size, activation='softmax', name="output"))
predicting code like:
Session.Runner r = s.runner();
Tensor result = r.fetch("output").run().get(0);
I want the tensor'name will be a fixed name "output" but it is "output/Softmax"
I tried to rename layer's name or tensor'name ,but all failed.
How can I name the final output from the model?
Thanks!
