First off, great library!
I'm trying to build an LSTM that can predict two-dimensional patterns. At this stage I'm just trying to train it on the pattern of a unit circle. For each time step there are two inputs: the x and y values. My model looks like this:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(25, 2) )) #network length (in time) is 25 time steps
...
model.add(Dense(2))
With this setup, I assumed the X_train vector should look like [total_time_steps x 2]. Using TensorFlow as a backend, I get:
"ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (5000, 25, 2) for Tensor u'Placeholder_13:0', which has shape (Dimension(None), Dimension(None))"
I haven't had luck using an X_train vector of shape [n_batches x t_steps x 2] either. I'd appreciate any advice
