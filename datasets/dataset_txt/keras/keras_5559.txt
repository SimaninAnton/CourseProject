Hey Guys,
Just as the title says, the problem occurred when I build seq2seq learning.
I want to build an RNN that has different timesteps between batches, but equal length in one batch, which I mean the data had been divided into different batches(equal padding length in one batch).
How can I properly build the model by repeatvector(n1)/repeatvector(n2)/repeatvector(n3)....
nx means x th batch sample length(timesteps)
the reason why I try so is that as much as to reduce the impact of masking.
