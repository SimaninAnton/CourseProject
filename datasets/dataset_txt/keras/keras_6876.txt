In visual object detection task, we should label each pixel with some labeles such as 'road', 'car', 'tree' and so on, as in the figure below.

left: the input image; right: the target.
I think this task can be solved with convolutional neural network (CNN), which shows its power in many image-related tasks.
In the examples folder, the CNN expamples are all about image labelling task which input is a image and output is a single label. How can we employ CNN to the visual object detection task, which requires the output is also a image?
