I have tried to ask this twice with no response.
Could you please explain the reason why sample_weight is restricted to 1D when you have 2D target?
In multi-label case (where each label is independent of each other), you want to weight each sample of each label differently. For instance, if one image is labeled to have multiple targets.
What is the best workaround without resorting to a graph model with multiple outputs for each label?
