Hi,
I am new to Keras and ML . Now I am trying to do some tests about OCR via CNN+LSTM or just LSTM. Currently I have hundreds of images and the corresponding words (ground truth). One image can be split into many lines, there should be one word each line at least (demo images as follows). Images after line-segmented may have different height and width. I looked into mnist_cnn.py and mnist_irnn.py, the input is a single letter and images have the same size. How to set up this model to perform OCR task so that images after line-segmented can be feed into network directly?
Any advice will be welcomed. Thanks in advance!
Best regards,
demo images
