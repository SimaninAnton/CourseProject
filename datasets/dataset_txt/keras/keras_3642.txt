I want to use multiple worker threads (as opposed to worker processes) when training using fit_generator(). I've got a fast GPU, my model is quick to train and I use some fairly expensive data augmentation, so I need 4-6 worker threads in order for them to keep up with the GPU.
Using processes instead of threads is not a good option because even pickling/unpickling my data batches adds too much CPU overhead. So I set nb_worker=6 and pickle_safe=False, and run into the warning on line 894 in models.py:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/models.py#L893
What is the reason for forcing nb_worker to be 1 when pickle_safe = False? I've tried commenting that whole check out and everything seems to run fine.
