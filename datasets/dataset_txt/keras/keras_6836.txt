Just an update on where Keras is going in the short term.
Here are the goals for the next release:
More unit test coverage. @phreeza and @tleeuwenburg have been making significant progress on this front.
Caffe model importing. @pranv has a PR for this, hopefully we can merge it asap.
Support for automatic architecture/hyperparam search. I am working on it.
Stateful recurrent layers for efficient sequence generation. See: #98
TimeDistributed layer to make it possible to include any layer type as part of a recurrent architecture.
Let me know if I'm forgetting anything important.
Regarding visualization tools: these will be developed as a standalone app separate from Keras, in order to be usable with other deep learning frameworks as well. The project is still essentially at the ideation phase. Hulaos is a first concrete step.
