Hi,
I want to implement a custom ActivityRegularizer .
I want to take the output of the network and calculate some additional losses using some Python /Skcit functions.
However, for this I need to use K.eval() on self.layer.output. The code however won't allow me because K.eval() isn't available during compile time.
How do I get over this problem?
