I would like to train a graph on task, add a layer, then resume training. What is the best way to do this? I won't always be adding a layer to the end of the graph.
I am assuming I will perform the first step with one graph, save the weights, and attempt to initialize a new graph with the weights learned in the first step. The current code seems to rely upon the order of the params list when naming the weights in the hdf file. If I want to be able to make changes to the graph that would change that order, I need a method for knowing which params to set when reloading the weights.
My current idea is to generate a unique name for each param based on the layer name, and store the params in the hdf file according to their unique names. Then when loading the weights into the modified graph I would know which params to set.
Is this a sensible approach? Would it break things? Would it be compatible with all existing functionality?
thanks for your excellent work
