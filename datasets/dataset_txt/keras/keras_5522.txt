Hi All,
Hope you're doing well. This is a question about the functionality of Convolutional2D. Thank you for taking your time to look at this! :)
I'm trying to filter an image with n channels where each channel is filtered separately. However, the Convolution2D layer ends up summing up all my channel activations. For example, a layer of the form
model.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, border_mode='valid', input_shape=(3, 100, 100)))
will produce an output of the following shape:
(None, 64, 224, 224)
I want the output of the layer to be (numFilters, numChannels, rows, cols):
(64, 3, 224, 224)
Is the only way to achieve this with the Convolution3D function? If so, what would that command look like? Thank you for your time!
Best,
Davis
