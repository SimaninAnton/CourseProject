This place is for discussing how to add Recurrentshop's features to Keras.
Recurrentshop is a framework for building complex RNNs using Keras.
https://github.com/datalogai/recurrentshop
See readme and docs/ for more info on the functionalities that recurrentshop provides.
A couple of Caveats :
When unroll=False we can not have a Dropout layer in the RNN on theano backend. This is some issue on theano's end. RandomStreams op is not supported inside scan it seems. I tried feeding the updates from scan back to the model's updates, didn't help. Perhaps @nouiz can help?
Teacherforcing not working in tensorflow. Something about the ground truth tensor being created in a different frame. I don't know what that means. @fchollet?
Interested folks please go through the documentation and post your thoughts here. Once we have a well defined roadmap, we can get to the actual work.
Cheers!
@fchollet @EderSantana @abhaikollara @malaikannan @Joshua-Chin
