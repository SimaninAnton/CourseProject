A minor issue, admittedly, but is there a builtin way to set the call order of a model's callbacks (on_epoch_end, on_batch_begin and so on)? I assume the callbacks follow the input list's ordering, but what about the defaults. Specifically ProgbarLogger, since it seems to be called last, the output gets wonky in case any other callback also prints to stdout during on_epoch_end.
