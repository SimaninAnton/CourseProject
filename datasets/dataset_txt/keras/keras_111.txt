I am using Keras to build my architecture. The regression problem I am trying to solve has outputs different for different training samples. For instance, for 1st training sample, I have output as [16,3] for 2nd training sample it is [6]. I am unable to find a solution about how to assign units to output dense layer based on this type of output. You can interpret the output as having y_train having shape [no. of samples, columns(depending on how many outputs do specific training sample has)]. I have tried to fetch each and every input from y_train, so that I would have assign the length of this input to output dense layer as units, e.g. as for 1st training sample, we have [16,3] as output (input in y_train to predict for 1st training sample), I am planning to set output dense layer's unit as 2 and so on. but I even don't know how to fetch this and assign it to output dense layer's unit. Can anybody help me on this variable length output problem?
