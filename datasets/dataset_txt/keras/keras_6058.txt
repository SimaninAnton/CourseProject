Travis passed on all python version / flags combinations except for one.
The problem is not in the place were code was changed but
an error in downloading MNIST file from S3 because the file already exists.
I guess this is some kind of a race condition between all the tests and all the Travis tests should run in their own sandbox
this is the Travis error:
