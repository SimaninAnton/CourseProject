This is really weird. I'm getting really bad overfitting when using ImageDataGenerator/fit_generator only in multiple processes mode, and only with more than one worker process. My accuracy during the first epoch will rise as high as 0.75 with enough worker processes, even though my validation accuracy is only around 0.01.
