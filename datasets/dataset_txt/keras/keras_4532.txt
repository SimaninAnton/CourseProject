Is there a way to build a model and train it, then plug it in to a new network?
What i'm trying to achieve is a layer, with lets say
[(batch, samples, channel, row, column), Model] 
input, where i iterate through the samples dim (Theano-scan or TimeDistributed is also o.k. for that matter) and for each
(batch, channel, row, column) 
i run the Model.
Today i specify the model in a costume layer where i need to play with the building and calling of each layer (something like the juggling in TimeDistributed).
I think it will be a powerful tool for keras if it's not already exist in someway
