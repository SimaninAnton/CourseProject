I am trying to understand the current BatchNormalization code after the introduction of mode=2, when using mode=2. Is it correct that during the prediction phase the prediction is made using the aggregate statistic of the given batch (so mean and std is computed from prediction batch). So if, lets say, I make a prediction using a large batch size, it would be one value, but if I make a forward prediction on a single value, it could swing wildly to a different value?
Aka prediction is stochastic, rather than deterministic.
