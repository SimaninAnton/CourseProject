I'm doing a lambda layer in which I'd like to split a tensor into two (so the opposite of K.concatenate, essentially) to perform some different operations on the two parts, before concatenating them again. Any thoughts on how to split with the Keras backend?
import keras.backend as K
t = K.ones((12,3))
t1, t2 = ...  # Split somehow?
t = K.concatenate([t1,t2])
