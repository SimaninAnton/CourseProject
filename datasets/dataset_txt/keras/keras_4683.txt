While I observed that BatchNormalization is speeding up the convergence, it also adds A LOT to the training time. When I use BatchNormalization after each of my Conv layers for example, my epoch time rises from ~10 seconds to multiple minutes. Given that I could train dozens of non-BN-epochs for each BN-epoch, I'm sceptical if using BatchNormalization in Keras is worth the additional training time.
Thoughts? Is there any other benefit?
