Why do we shuffle X and Y independently of each other? If Y are labels for the dataset, corresponding in row order, we just destroyed the order by using the shuffle. Shouldn't we preserve order by shuffling the indices of the data?
        if shuffle:
            seed = random.randint(1, 10e6)
            np.random.seed(seed)
            np.random.shuffle(X)
            np.random.seed(seed)
            np.random.shuffle(y)
Would something like this work?
        if shuffle:
            seed = random.randint(1, 10e6)
            np.random.seed(seed)
            indices = np.arange(X.shape[0])
            np.random.shuffle(indices)
            X = X[indices]
            y = y[indices]
