As the mentioned code shows, the validation after each epoch will be firstly separated into batches, and then to collect all the output metrics and reduce them by mean.
I was wondering the meaning of batches of validation, whether it is for the parallel reason? If so, how can I set the batch_sizes of training and validation separately in order to disable the separation of validation?
Actually, the reason why I am struggling with this issue is that I want to use some metrics related to the whole y_true and y_pred, e.g. R-value and normalized MSE. If such metrics are required, should I add a callback on epoch end to obtain the entire matrices and do the particular metrics manually?
Thanks.
