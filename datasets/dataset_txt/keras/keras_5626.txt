I don't understand what is timesteps in Recurrent.
In my opinion,I have a dateset like this [x1,x2,x3] [x4,x5,x6] [x7,x8,x9],each of xi is n dimension vector.
When I train the rnn,I take the first group[x1,x2,x3] as input, one by one,and get one output y1.
It is the same way in group[x4,x5,x6] and group[x7,x8,x9].
The group size is timesteps.
Is it my opinion is right?
Could give me some literature about this?
Thanks.
