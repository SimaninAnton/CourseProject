I have found fit_generator to be quite slow.
This makes the disk read speed a major bottleneck when the network is relatively shallow.
Using the multiprocessing module instead of the threading one, I was able to get significant improvements in speed (half the time) as shown in this gist example.
I could look into making a pull request with this new implementation if you think the speed gain is worth it.
