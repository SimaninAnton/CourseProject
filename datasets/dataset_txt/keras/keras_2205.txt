Several of the tests in tests/keras/test_callbacks.py use the following pattern:
filepath = './logs'
<function that writes to the filepath>
assert os.path.exists(filepath)
shutil.rmtree(filepath)
Since they all use the same filepath, when running the tests with the parallel test driver there is always the possibility that one function will delete the directory in between the one writing it and the other checking its existence. It would make more sense to use the pytest builtin tmpdir fixture.
