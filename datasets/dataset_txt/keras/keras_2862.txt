Hi,
I dived into Keras code and in the topology.py file I saw this code:
if self.mode == 'sum' or self.mode == 'ave':
s = inputs[0]
for i in range(1, len(inputs)):
s += inputs[i]
if self.mode == 'ave':
s /= len(inputs)
return s
Are the arithmetic operators + and / overridden somewhere (I didn't find it) in order to use the backend operators?
I found the operation sum into the backend directory, but it's only to compute the sum of all the element in the given tensor, not the sum of two tensors.
Would it be the update_add and update_sub functions?
