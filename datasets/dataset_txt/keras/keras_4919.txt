Hi,
Am trying to solve a classification problem using time series/ Sequential data using CNN.
I have created some features using simple mathematical transformation from same data.
Following are the things I tried.
1D conv net with features as multiple row
2D conv net with single channel and features as rows( Filter nb_rows =1)
2D conv net with channel = number of features(Filter nb_rows =1)
I want to know what would be the correct approach.
My understanding is as follows:
1D conv net with multiple rows net treats each row as different information.
2D with 1 channel and multiple rows with filter nb_rows=1 should behave same as 1D conv net with multiple rows
2D conv net with features as different channels help to learn new abstractions.
Appreciate your comments on which approach fits best theoritically.
