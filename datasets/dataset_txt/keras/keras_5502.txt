The most recent version of Keras crashes after the first epoch when a TensorBoard callback is added that records histograms.
Failing Example Code (examples/mnist_mlp.py with added callback) and Crash Log:

Judging by the output the issue is related to keras_learning_phase not being fed. The code works normally when histogram_freq is set to 0 or the Dropout layers are removed.
