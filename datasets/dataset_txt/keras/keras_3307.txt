I'm training a large LSTM network using around 10 million sequences of 6-12 length characters with Keras, I'm using the one-hot representation for input and output, with a large learning rate, it doesn't converge, but with a very small learning rate, it converges and the leaning curve looks fine, but got a validation result worse than large learning rate, can anyone suggest me a good way to find good hyperparams and a way to decide if I have got the best result the model can get?
thanks very much!
