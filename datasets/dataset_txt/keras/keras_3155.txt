Here is how to reproduce the result:
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, border_mode='same', input_shape=(3, 256, 256)))
    print(model.input_shape, model.output_shape)
According to the document, the output should be
((None, 3, 256, 256), (None, 64, 256, 256))
but I got
((None, 3, 256, 256), (None, 3, 256, 64))
I have no idea why. My keras version is 1.2.2 and I tried with both tensorflow 0.10.0 and 0.12.0.
