I would like to replicate @fchollet's example here for text classification to obtain sequences that maximize the activations of specific filters or the activiations towards a certain output class.
I'm running on TensorFlow and have loaded the weights of a trained Sequential model with a Convolution1D layer.
Instead of input_img in the post, I set input_seq = K.placeholder((MAX_LEN, MAX_FEATURES)).
I access the output of a specified layer as in the example: layer_output = layer_dict[layer_name].get_output().
I calculate the loss as loss = K.mean(layer_output[:, filter_index, :]).
However, computing the gradients with K.gradients(loss, input_seq) yields [None].
Could you tell me what I'm doing wrong? Thank you so much for your help!
