I need to predict something that a machine does. I have measured context data and need to output continuous values. Since the values can be open ranged, I thought it might be best to make them relative to each other, meaning the network has to output the relative change over time. I have visualized my Y data: link
The problem I am dealing with is that my network hardly learns anything. It quickly learns to output the average. As you can see in the image, most of the targets lay around 1.001 and very very seldomly there are spikes. In my use case, I'm interested in finding these spikes.
As an output function, I'm currently using exp. I also draw un-uniformly from my data, meaning I'm showing my network data with outlaying targets more often than they actually appear.
Does anyone have experience with these kind of data?
