when I run the imdb_lstm.py, and there is error info:
Using Theano backend.
Loading data...
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "imdb_lstm.py", line 53, in
test_split=0.2)
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/Keras-1.0.1-py2.7.egg/keras/datasets/imdb.py", line 20, in load_data
X, labels = cPickle.load(f)
EOFError
Need I add the try expect ?
