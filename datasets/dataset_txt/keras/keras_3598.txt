@fchollet Sorry, I would have made these changes myself but I'd rather leave it to you to sort out the formatting on this page, due to the first bullet point below:
The docs/templates/scikit-learn-api.md file is out of date. It is using an older (I'm guessing) form of grouping things together. Specifically, the "Arguments" are set up differently than other docs, and there is more information that usual available below.
It should be noted that using the API returns an object f such that f.model is a Keras model.
This allows people to use f.model.* functions to see the model summary(), save() the model, get the weights via get_weights(), etc.
This all became apparent via a Slack chat.
