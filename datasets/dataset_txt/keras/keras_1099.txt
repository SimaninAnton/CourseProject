When specifying the NN structure like this:
model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(encoded), kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(l = 0.6)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1) 
I receive the following error message:
This only happens in R. In python I don't have any problems with Keras.
Details:
[y ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[y ] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
[y ] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
library(insuranceData)
library(onehot)
library(keras)

data(AutoClaims)

response = AutoClaims$PAID
predictors = AutoClaims[,1:4]

encoded = onehot(predictors, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, addNA = FALSE, max_levels = 50)
encoded = as.matrix(predict(encoded,predictors))

#this is the line that causes the error:
model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = ncol(encoded), kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2(l = 0.6)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1) 
The console returns:
Error in py_initialize(config$python, config$libpython, config$pythonhome,  :
