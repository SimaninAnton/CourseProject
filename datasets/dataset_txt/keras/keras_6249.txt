Hey there,
I have been doing a lot of work recently with Theano in getting a two-stream CNN set up for classification purposes. Everything is working fine, but I feel that the readability of the Theano framework is nowhere near as verbose as what keras can offer me.
Does anybody have a worked example for a two-stream CNN?
Cheers,
KeironO.
Edit: Readability is important as I'm attempting to show the networks to people unfamiliar with the delicate intricacies of DL.
