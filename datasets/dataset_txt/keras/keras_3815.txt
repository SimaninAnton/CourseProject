I wrote LSTM code with keras, the shape of input is (128, 23, 9)
In predicting, i just want one result, so my input shape is (1, 23, 9)
after that, i got an exception
Exception: Error when checking : expected lstm_input_1 to have shape (128, 23, 9) but got array with shape (1, 23, 9)
may one help me?
sorry for my pool english.
