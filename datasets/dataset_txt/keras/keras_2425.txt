When I did a conv2d operation like this:
model.add(Convolution2D(k_size_0, 3, 3, init='he_normal', border_mode='valid', kernel_constraint=max_norm(3., axis=0), kernel_constraint=nonneg()))
I put two constraints for kernel_constraint and there was an error:
SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated
So can I pass a list with multiple items to the kernel_constraint argument instead of only one?
Thank you
