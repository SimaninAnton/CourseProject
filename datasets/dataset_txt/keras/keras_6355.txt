my keras is not built upon theano but tensorflow, for the testing , I am running a mnist_mlp.py, it outputs the error :
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/activations.py", line 20, in relu
return T.nnet.relu(x)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'relu
how to solve this issue?
