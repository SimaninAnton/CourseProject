when I try to run the code by using GPU, I get following error
from keras.models import Sequential
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/models.py", line 8, in <module>
  File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/objectives.py", line 5, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name range
It works fine on CPU version
