I have a cost function that in addition to using the overall network output, needs to multiply it by another function of the network weights (it's actually the partial derivative of the output with respect to one of the inputs). Custom cost functions are parameterised as f(y_true, y_pred), and so cannot be used to provide this second function of the weights that I want.
I've seen a similar issue before where @shamidreza states that they had to use Theano for this functionality.
Is it still the case that this is the best option? I've only used Keras in R before so have no experience with either TensorFlow or Theano, would either be suitable in R?
