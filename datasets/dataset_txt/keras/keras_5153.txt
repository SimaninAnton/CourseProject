i tried to do grid search for finding optimal params.
i write some similar code to this one: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/bb626c120ea56b35b3fde9057877df461af0b02b/examples/mnist_sklearn_wrapper.py
but i have two X, and one Y, which is different from this example(one X, one Y).
i tried to use
validator.fit([x1,x2],Y)
but it showed an error that:
ValueError: Found arrays with inconsistent numbers of samples: [ 2 2500]
i re-check the training data. without the grid search, it can run very well.
so i suspect the fit method cannot receive multiple inputs.
what is the solution, and am i missed something?
