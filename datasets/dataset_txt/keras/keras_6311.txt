@fchollet Is there any reason why we can't have a softmax that uses reshape instead of scan?
For my applications it's about ~30ms (251 vs 287) faster for a 128 batchsize with 10k vocabulary. It's not much compared to the rest of the net, but it's a free performance gain.
For applications like #1168, where the number of steps is big compared to number of classes, it's twice slower with scan (16ms vs 7ms)
