Hi, I changed thekeras.jsonto enforce it use Theano as backend, shown as following
bash-4.1$ cat ~/.keras/keras.json
{"floatx": "float32", "epsilon": 1e-07, "backend": "theano","image_dim_ordering": "th"}
However, when running the program, it still show that Tensorflow is backend. How to solve this issue? Thanks.
