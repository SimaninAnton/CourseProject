When I run the tutorial to use pre-trained word embeddings (available in pretrained_word_embeddings.py), I get the following results, finally resulting in a poor accuracy. I am not sure how to fix this problem. Can anyone please help me to fix this problem. Also I am running keras with Theano backend on CPU. Is this something to do with running keras on CPU as against GPU.
