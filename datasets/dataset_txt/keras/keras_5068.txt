I read the threads about sequence padding and I still have a doubt. In #85, fchollet suggested either to pad with zeros or to feed one sequence per time (batchsize=1).
There is still a doubt I didn't sort it out yet: in case I choose to pad with zeros, is it necessary to delimit my sequences with special BEGIN and END elements, or can the model automatically understand when to stop considering zeros?
