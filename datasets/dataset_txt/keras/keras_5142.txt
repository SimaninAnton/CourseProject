Hello
I am doing relational learning and I have different kind of inputs of the form:
x R y
where x and y are entities and R is a relation
I want to have a separate network part for each relation R
I tried to use a flat network with one output Oi per relation R
inputs, outputs = [ I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7], [O1, O2, O3, O4]
But I have to only use two I (eg I2 and I3) and one O (eg O4) at each training example
I understood that I should use masking to do so, and use two non zero input and one non zero output at each training example, but Reshape layers doesn't seem to support it
I can use a custom loss to ignore some kind of output but it would waste computing time
Ideally, I think it would be nice to have a kind of list which can return an arbitrary keras layer (such as a Dense layer)
This list could take an input and return a certain layer ( list[i] -> Dense() )
Do you have any idea how I can implement this in keras ?
Thanks
