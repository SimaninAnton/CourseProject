This relates to issues #1125 #1130 and #2030; I am also using batch_input_size = (batch_size, input_length, input_dim) but the issue is that input_length changes between training set and validation set. The reason for this is the type of data I have. I basically have 1 long very high dimensional time series (weather data of rougly 5000 sensors => input_dim=5000). This time series covers several years (=1 millions time points), so I split it up into 80% training data; 10% validation data and 10% test data and feed the training data as one batch (batch_size=1) to the RNN. Hence my input_length is different for training (800k) and validation/test(100k each). The error I get seems to indicate that this is the issue:
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
Is it possible to use stateful RNN in my case? I need it because after training I would like to generate weather data step by step feeding outputs of the RNN back as inputs and the earlier solution of recalculating the whole history of predictions each time is too inefficient.
