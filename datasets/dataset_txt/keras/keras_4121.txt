Hi,
I have been experimenting with the VAE code example. However, I am unable to reproduce digits with the same quality as the ones described in the blog.
Specifically, running the exact code in variational_autoencoder.py I obtain
If I reduce the range of points sampled from 15 stds to 2 stds the results are better
but still not nearly as good as the ones presented in the blog post
For example, in the top right corner, the blob produced does not resemble a digit.
Do you have any idea why this is not working as well even though I am running the exact same code?
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
