I'd really like to help out and add support for featurewise_center and featurewise_std_normalization for the directory iterator, or at least add some instructions to the readme.
Currently, the way I implement standardization over the entire dataset is to precompute the mean and standard deviation by iterating through some generator returned by flow_from_directory. Then I save these two numbers and then create another ImageDataGenerator and pass the preprocessing_function in.
Is integrating this functionality directly into the DirectoryIterator worth it? Or is an example in the docs sufficient?
