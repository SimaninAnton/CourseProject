Ever since the new outside-of-scan RNN computing, I'm forced to cut batch sizes in half (and thus double computing time) because the representation takes nearly double on the GPU.
Am I the only one experiencing this problem?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
