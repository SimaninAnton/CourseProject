InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Conv2DSlowBackpropInput: input and out_backprop must have the same batch sizeinput batch: 50outbackprop batch: 25 batch_dim: 0
I use TimeDistributed and Conv_transpose ops together, since I'm dealing with a 5-D tensor.
The model is built successfully, but when training starts, it throws this issue.
I've tried Keras 2.2.0 + Tensorflow 1.4.0 and Keras 2.1.3 + Tensorflow 1.4.0, however I did not try a higher version since then I have to update CUDA and CUDNN.
But I'm wondering that it has nothing to do with the version, since they are the most common ops in Deep Learning.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
[ ✔] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[ ✔] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
[ ✔] If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
