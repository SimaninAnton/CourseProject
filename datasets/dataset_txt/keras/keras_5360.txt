Hi,
I've built a layer called dissimilarity which returns :
K.sqrt(K.sum(K.square(inputs[1] - concatenated),axis=1, keepdims=True))
but the following error raised on buildinf the Model:
Output tensors to a Model must be Keras tensors. Found: <__main__.Dissimilarity object at 0x10f444908>
The test code is:
`
A = Input(shape=(3, None, None))
B = Input(shape=(3, None, None))
    crop_right_bound = Boundary(1)(A)
    crop_left = Crop_Side(3,0)(B)

    dis = Dissimilarity([crop_left, crop_right_bound])

    patch_compare = Model([part_A_input, part_B_input], dis)`
Do i need to configure anything else in my implementation of the layer?
