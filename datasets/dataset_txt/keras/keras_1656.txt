Hi there
I am training my Deep neural network on Keras (TF backend). I just want to print the first loss while training DNN. I just want to make sure that my initialization is correct and so I need the initial loss calculated by the DNN after making the first forward pass.
Keras callback allows us to determine loss after every epoch. I want it after first training step.
Any help is deeply appreciated.
Thanks
