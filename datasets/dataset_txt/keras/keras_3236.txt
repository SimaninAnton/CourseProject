Hello everyone,
I am trying to use the image generator that comes with keras with gpu and tensorflow to train a network. The problem is that I get the following message:
% (filename if filename else fp))
IOError: cannot identify image file '/home/braca/Documents/Kaggle/Nature/data/train_bin/train/YeF/._img_00020.jpg'
It does not seem to be able to open the image file with that weird image name. It automatically added the dot and the underscore, the image name in the folder is just img_00020.jpg.
You may check the script here:

Any help is highly appreciated.
