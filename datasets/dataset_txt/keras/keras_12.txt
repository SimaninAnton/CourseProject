Following are the last two lines of my model:
outputs = Dense(4)(act_fc1)
predictions = Activation(activation='softmax')(outputs)
If I use predictions as the model output, the model does not learn anything, but if I remove the predictions layer and add the activations parameter to outputs Dense layer, it works fine.
