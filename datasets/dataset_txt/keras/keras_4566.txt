Tried to run https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder_deconv.py as is.
Got exception in the generation part (on Keras 1.0.7 and TF 0.10.0rc0):
InvalidArgumentError: Conv2DSlowBackpropInput: input and out_backprop must have the same batch size
[[Node: conv2d_transpose_1 = Conv2DBackpropInput[T=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NHWC", padding="SAME", strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], use_cudnn_on_gpu=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"](conv2d_transpose_1/output_shape, transpose_9, transpose_7)]]

Works just fine on Theano 8.2.
