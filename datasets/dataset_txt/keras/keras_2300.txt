Hi -
I recently installed the keras docker image that is served from https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/docker.
using the makefile, when I invoke it with:
make notebook GPU=0
the notebook comes up fine. However, when I invoke a cell that has:
import keras
I get this error:
ImportError Traceback (most recent call last)
in ()
----> 1 import keras
ImportError: No module named 'keras'
