Hello!
I've been using tf.split [1] now several times in my own keras libraries. This sucks, as I want to programm backend-neutral libraries. Did I miss an obvious way to do that in Keras? Please let me know then.
I also consider the functionality of tf.split not an edge case, especially the ability to input a tensor and produce different-sized-slices is very useful.
I therefore propose adding keras.backend.split with functionality as given by [1].
Would that be considered bloating the API?
If not, I could probably figure out how to do that for both the tensorflow backend (trivial) and the Theano backend (might require a bit of work).
Unfortunately I know nothing about the CNTK-backend, so help would be appreciated there.
