Hi,
How do I measure the accuracy of my multi-class classifier with Keras at testing?
I have a set of predicted labels, and true labels for my image data (multi-class).
Is it by using the model.evalaute(..) in keras? I am using the Sequential model.
I don't quite understand what metrics does the model.evaluate() return.
Thanks

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
