I'm trying to run keras-yolo3's train.py (https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3) on the keras docker (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/docker), but it yields the following error:
AttributeError: 'InputLayer' object has no attribute 'outbound_nodes'
Full error: https://pastebin.com/34tJ8q4A
Everything is up to date (docker and keras-yolo3) as of today.
Any leads on this? To me it seems a problem with the docker, but somehow I still doubt that it might be with keras-yolo3 instead, as it is so old (6 months).
