I'm trying to use sample_weight. From the documentation, it seems I can pass a list or array. My data looks like a (number samples, number classes) matrix of 1s and 0s. What I would really like to do is weight each of the 1s in the matrix by some number. The weights matrix have size (number samples, number classes) with 0s and non-zero numbers in the sample place as the 1s for the data matrix.
When I set sample_weight to be equal to this matrix, keras fits the model, but I'm not sure it's doing exactly what I want it to do. For example, it also runs if I have sample_weight= weightsmatrix[:,1](makes sense, since by default all sample weights appears to be a vector of 1s) and sample_weight=weightsmatrix[:, 0:100](a subsection of the weights matrix), which should have no logical meaning.
I've looked through #243 (as well as 188 and 177)
cc9edcf in order to try and understand how sample_weight is implemented, but I wasn't able to see exactly it is used.
