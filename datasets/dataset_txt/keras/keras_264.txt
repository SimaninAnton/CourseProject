Hi,
I'm currently using two models, one that takes in a Numpy array and generates an audio file using Tensorflow and the other that inputs these audio files for further processing. I tried using z -= Input(shape=(1, 100)) but I get an error stating that I cannot input a tf.object into a given Tensorflow graph.
Is there any way that I can transform my input layers in Keras into a numpy array?
Thanks!
