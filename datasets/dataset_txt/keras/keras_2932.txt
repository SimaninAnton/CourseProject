Hello, I'm trying to do some customization works with filters of convolution layers. Could someone told me how to get the input of filters? Since filters are part of convolutional layers and cannot get their input byu layer.get_input(). Besides, I'm wondering how did Keras organise the calculations of CNN?
I checked the codes for some hours but cannot figure out how did Keras calculate feature maps and apply optimization methods on it? All I found is the backend functions like: K.get_gradients, K.conv_2d and so on. I understand as a high level library, Keras uses TH or TF as its backend and may not directly support these filter/convolutional calculation, could someone kindly tells me which part in tensorflow defines the calculation of convolution layers?
