I want to do some data augment to my dataset, however, when I want to do
featurewise_center, samplewise_centerusing
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    featurewise_center=True,  # set input mean to 0 over the dataset
    samplewise_center=False,  # set each sample mean to 0
    featurewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide inputs by std of the dataset
    samplewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide each input by its std
    zca_whitening=False,  # apply ZCA whitening
    rotation_range=20,  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)
    width_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)
    height_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)
    horizontal_flip=True,  # randomly flip images
    vertical_flip=False,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    channel_shift_range=0.,
    fill_mode='nearest',
    cval=0.,

)
I find that it need to have the following code to make it works.
train_datagen.fit(Xtrain)
the Xtrain need to be a array. However, I need to use flow_from_directory() to load my data otherwise I will have a memory problem.
So my question is how can I do
featurewise_center,
    samplewise_center
when I use flow_from_directory()
Many thanks!
