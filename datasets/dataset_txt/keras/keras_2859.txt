Now the Conv1D layer and Conv2D layer are using "channels_last" as their default data_format instead of None as the other layers.
See Conv1D init and Conv2DTranspose init.
This leads to an issue where these two layers' default data format won't change automatically with respect to the backend image_data_format() settings as the other layers.
I wonder is there a specific reason for this. Otherwise, it seems less confusing if these two layers have consistent default data_format as the other layers.
