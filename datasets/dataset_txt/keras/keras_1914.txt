In an ARIMA model, we can see the weights given to previous lags. An LSTM model takes as input three dimensions (Number of samples, timesteps, dimension). But the input weight is just of size (dimension, number of cells). Is there a way to determine the weights for the past lags. If the input batch has 10 samples, then atleast the weights should be given to all samples in batch
