I need to feed images of different size to FCN learned using keras + tensorflow backend. @
When I specify input
inputs = Input(shape=(channels,None,None))
or
model_15.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, W_regularizer=l2(l=l2_reg),input_shape=(channels, None, None)))
during the model compilation i get
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType'
while
shape=(channels,15,15) works OK.
Any ideas why does it occur and how to overcome this?
According to @fchollet ( #1920 ) it should work ok.
