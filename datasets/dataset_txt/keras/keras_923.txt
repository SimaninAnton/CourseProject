I'm facing an issue trying to create the following model (https://gist.github.com/cbuffevant/aa2065f4e49221b13585d073f1b7e140):
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv1D, LSTM, TimeDistributed, Flatten

model = Sequential()
model.add(TimeDistributed(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(8, 100))))
model.add(TimeDistributed(Flatten()))
model.add(LSTM(1000, activation='relu', recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', dropout=0.2))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))

model.summary()
Call to model.summary() fails with the error message:
This model has never been called, thus its weights have not yet been created, so no summary can be displayed. Build the model first (e.g. by calling it on some test data).
If I remove the TimeDistributed wrapper the call to model.summary works as expected.
I ran that script using Python 3.6, Keras (master), TensorFlow 1.10.
Is this the exptect behaviour? Am I missing something related to TimeDistributed wrapper?
I will really appreciate any help.
