There is an early draft branch available for Keras 2: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/keras-2
Note that the codebase will keep evolving a lot. Support for backwards compatibility with Keras 1 will only be added once the new codebase is finalized.
In this thread I will be posting very specific requests for contribution.
[DONE] Fix Theano Conv2DTranspose layer
The Deconvolution layer has become Conv2DTranspose, with a simplified API that does not require users to specify an output shape (that was a big issue with the previous API). The new implementation works fine with TensorFlow, but appears to be broken with Theano (most likely the backend function conv2d_tranpose). I haven't had time to look into it, feel free to check it out and fix it.
[MOSTLY DONE] Unit tests
The API is changing and the previous unit tests all need to be ported to the new API. I haven't started to look into this. Feel free to pick any unit test file and update it.
Update examples to the new API
Likewise.
If you have feedback, bugs to report, or if you're opening PRs against the keras-2 branch, post in this thread.
