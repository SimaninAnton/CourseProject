I am using Keras with Tensorflow backend, and I intended to clip and round the output of an intermediate layer with code like output = Lambda(lambda x: K.round(K.clip(x))(input), but this code will raise the value error "None type not supported" from Tensorflow. Does that mean I should not use clip or round in such layers as they produce zero gradient almost everywhere?
