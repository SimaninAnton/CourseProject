So I have tried to run the code here:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/reuters_mlp_relu_vs_selu.py
and it gives me the following error:
ImportError: cannot import name AlphaDropout
Besides that, it also cannot find 'selu'
I have upgraded Keras to the latest version.
Has anybody experienced this import error before?
