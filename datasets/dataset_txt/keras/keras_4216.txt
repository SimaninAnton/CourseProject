Current solution in the wiki page for switching the backend for pretrained models is limited to fixed dimension ordering. For an Example, If you trained a model with Theano backend and used 'th' ordering, you have to preserve the dimension ordering as 'th' when you switch to Tensorflow. What is the efficient and correct way to convert model fully to another backend with correct ordering ?
Example: dim_order = 'th' backend = theano --> dim_order = 'tf' backend = tensorflow
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
