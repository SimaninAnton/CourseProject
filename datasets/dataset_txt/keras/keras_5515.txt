1、In training process, validation data are necessary? According to my experiments, training loss is also decreasing and training accuracy is also visible without validation data (I use model.fit()). So I think validation data are not necessary. The positions of validation_X,validation_Y could be assigned to test data. Am I wrong?
hist = model.fit(train,train_label, batch_size=32, nb_epoch=10, verbose=1, show_accuracy=True, validation_data=(test, test_label))
print (max(hist.history['val_acc']))
2、In fit() function, how can I get the best model among the total epoches?
Any opinions would be appreciated!
