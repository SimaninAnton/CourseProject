Hello,
I am in real troubles here. The reference is AWS EC2 Ubuntu:14.04 instance with all my packages installed including Keras, Theano, Tensorflow and the rest of the more standard imports.
My project should run on Theano backend.
In my files, I preceeded the
import keras ...
or
from keras import ....
with the line
os.environ['KERAS_BACKEND']='theano',
also, I changed the keras.json in the .keras directory to theano as backend.
From interactive Python session, I can import both theano or tensorflow without problems depending on the os.environ parameter.
But the I want to run my Python files from a flask app and here Theano does not work while Tensorflow is nicely imported. The app is just waiting (no print of 'using theano backend' shows up.
Can anybody give me a hint please
thanks a lot
Peter
