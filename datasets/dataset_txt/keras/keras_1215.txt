I'm having a weird problem with keras.
I commented the problem in this question: stack question
and that's it.
I'm trying to run this example just to test keras on a docker-container. And model.fit or model.evaluate are not working at all, it just gets stock without throwing any error.
it just stopped there.
Outside the docker container it works properly though.
My dockerfile is here
And I call it this way:
@app.route('/ocr/test_keras', methods=['GET'])
def test_keras():
    Thread(target=continue_test_keras, args=()).start()
    return jsonify('Success')

def continue_test_keras():
    tk.run()
    print('tests done')
where tk is this gist
it would be nice at least having an error log or an exception. But just stocking there, I don't have a clue, what I could be.
I read this issue, but I'm using tensorflow, and as I use a dockerfile, it reinstalls always everything again.
