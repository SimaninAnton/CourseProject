At the beginning I use Keras-0.2.0 Theano-0.7.0 on pypi source, I have wrote a small program to test mnist dataset recognize, at each epoch it takes 40s after 8 epochs it's accuracy will be 0.99, but I can not use Activation('relu') when I use 'relu' it will throw a exception, then I public a issue on github, the owner told me to update Theano from github, so I uninstall Theano on my computer and install new Theano from Github, when I use new Theano 'relu' can be used, but it's accuracy is very low may be 0.2 or less,so I thought it may be Keras' problem so I update my Keras to 0.3.0, But ETA is too high about 900s and accuracy is too low about 0.1 it must haven't pooling, so I delete MaxPooling2D code, and use subsample=() parameter ETA is lower but accuracy is too low about 0.1. Then I have to install Keras-0.2.0 and do not use 'relu'.
I think this is a small bug on Keras-0.3.0, Maxpooling2D and Activation('relu') can not be used very well.
If somebody meet the same problem please tell me how to solve it. The example of mnist_cnn.py's result is very well so I think may be it's my own problem.
Thanks For Reading My Problem...
