Hello, I have an issue with a model, which could be interesting to investigate. Please have a look:
https://github.com/nicolov/segmentation_keras/blob/master/model.py
I want to fine-tune this with a different number of classes (for example 2).
By the way I should modify these two layers and change 21 to 2:
model.add(Convolution2D(21, 1, 1, activation='linear', name='fc-final'))
and
model.add(Convolution2D(21, 1, 1, name='ct_final'))
Also, freeze other layers and make them trainable = False
Now my questions:
I don't know how can I determine how many layers model have to freeze until one of these layers.
I should freeze except than two separate layers. if the correct method of freezing in such situations is to do separately, I should know what is the number of these layers in the model. How can I know that?
