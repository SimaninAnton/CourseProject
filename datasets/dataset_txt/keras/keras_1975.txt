Hi all,
Works fine in 1.1 but in 1.2:
from tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras.models import load_model
K.set_learning_phase(False)
model = load_model(MODEL_PATH)
model.uses_learning_phase <-- returns TRUE
This does not happen in 1.1. What may have changed that cause this in 1.2?
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Dylan Randle
