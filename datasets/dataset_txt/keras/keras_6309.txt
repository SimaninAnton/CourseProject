We would like to start autogenerating the documentation from docstrings in the source. What are your thoughts on this, and suggestions as to what tools we should use and how this should be handled?
In particular, we would like to:
keep the documentation source files in MarkDown
be able to blend additional "manual" notes (stored in MarkDown files) with the autogenerated MarkDown, seamlessly
be able to integrate with our existing static website generator (mkdocs).
