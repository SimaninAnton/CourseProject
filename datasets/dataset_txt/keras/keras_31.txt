I have saved my model during training via callback and tensorflow.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint but it saved my model as .pb which is a TF format and not a keras format (h5). I want to know how I can convert the pb format to keras or load it directly to keras.
My saved model structure:
saved_trained_10_epochs
    ├── assets
    ├── saved_model.pb
    └── variables
        ├── variables.data-00000-of-00001
        └── variables.index
