I am trying to visualize the activations of my convnet text classifier. I want to put back the max values back to their original location so that I can find which word(s) in the text triggered the activation. Can I do this with the layers provided with keras??

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
