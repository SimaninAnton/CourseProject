Hello Keras community!
It's been a few I'm dev on Keras but I'm encountering a small problem for which you might know.
I have 1000 1-D time series, each one of length 101.
I'm interesting in understanding the mechanism t -> t+1 based on the sequence up to time t. I, thus, have 100 corresponding mapping t->t+1.
I'm using a simple LSTM with:
Input (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim) = (1000, 100, 1)
What should be my output? Is this correct:
Output (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim) = (1000, 100, 1)
Also can you give me a simple LSTM that could do this one-to-one mapping.
Thanks!
