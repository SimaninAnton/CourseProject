I am doing a project to produce songs with a neural network and I will use Keras in python. I think i will use dense layers. This is the model I will use:
Input : a matrix in which a line corresponds to one note and there are 3 columns which correspond to the characteristics of one note (I think it will be like the key, the duration and the volume...). So the matrix represents a set of notes.
Output : the next note to play after the last note played in input. So a line with the 3 characteristics.
However I dont understand how to do implement this model with Keras.
How can I get the 3 right numbers at the end of the neural network (and not numbers between 0 and 1)? Does one neuron correspond to one characteristic? So do I need 3 neurons per note?
What is the difference between the number of neurons of the first layer and the dimension of the input? I mean how Keras uses our data in input ? Same for output.
Thank you in advance for your help.
