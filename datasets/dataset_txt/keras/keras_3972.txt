I have two outputs and two objective functions in my network. I want the first objective function just trains a set of layers (e.g. the first 5 layers) while the second one trains the rest.
Is that possible to assign layers to an objective function?
or the only solution is to switch between objective function and recompile the model in each iteration and change the "trainable" property of each layer in between?
