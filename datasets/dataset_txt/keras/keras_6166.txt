Not a Python expert so I may be missing something here, but I think this line of code in Lambda layer's get_output:
func = types.FunctionType(func, globals())
seems to use the globals from the core module. I think it may be helpful if there is a way for caller to inject their own globals, since a lot of times the function needs custom values.
