Hi, this is more of a question, than an issue.. I want to know conceptually what is the difference between Activity and Weight regularizer?
How to decide between using either of them?
I'm fine tuning AlexNet for a problem. As usual, I'm popping out the last Dense layer, followed by adding a new Dense layer. I don't want to freeze the initial feature layers, but I want the feature layers to be updated at a slower rate than the new Dense layer I added. I got the impression that Weight regularizers are the way to do that (apply different regularization values at different layers).
Also, just to clarify, higher values of regularizer implies slower update right, since higher regularizer means more emphasis on regularization and less on the error rate?
