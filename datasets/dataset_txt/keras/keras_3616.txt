The latest version of TF has some breaking changes that affects Keras. See description here. Below are some issues I've found and quick fixes.
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'select'
Add the following before importing Keras:
import tensorflow as tf
tf.select = tf.where
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for : 'IndexedSlices' and 'int'
Turn off clipnorm in the optimizer. I'll look into how this can actually be fixed when I have time.
I'll add more as I find them. Of course, these issues have to be fixed in the backend code. These quick fixes are just for anyone needing to get their code running.
