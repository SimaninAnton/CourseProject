Hi,
I have two outputs in the model. I use Activation(softmax,name="eid_class") and Activation(softmax,name="sid_class") to define them.
During training, I set the class weight dictionary as following:
{"eid_class":{0:1.0, 1:1.6, 2:3.0}}
However, I find the training does not change when I apply this weight compared with the one without weight.
Is there any mistake in my program? Thank you.
