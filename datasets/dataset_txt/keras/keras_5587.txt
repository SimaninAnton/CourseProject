Hi. I'm confused about the classification problem with RNN.
I have a (20000,3) time sequence and I want to classify each (1,3) vector in the sequence to its classes(9 classes in total).
According to Keras document, the size of LSTM layer's input data should be (nb_samples,timesteps,input_dim).
In my case, the nb_samples is 20000, input_dim is 3. What's the timestep?Is it 1?
Another question. Since the (1,3) vectors are related to each other in the time domain, if I set the timestep as 1, can the LSTM layer make use of the time correlation between them?
Thank you for your help!
