Hi,
I'm interested in the label smoothing in this paper. I'm not sure whether we should implement it as a loss function or a pre-processing method for the labels.
At present I've added label smoothing as a choice of pre-processing in the to_categorical method in utils/np_utils.py, which seems to be the easiest way.
Best regards.
