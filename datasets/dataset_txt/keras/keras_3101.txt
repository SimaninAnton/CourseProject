Keras == 1.2.1
TF == 0.12.1
Problem with weights saving for the trained model (without optimizer) save_weights().
Just example:
net.save_weights(path)
...
net.set_weights(ps.load_weights(path))
weights = net.get_weights()
print(weights[1][:4])
I stop the training for the first time and save checkpoints save_weights(path)
But it tries to save zeros
But when I stops again and save/load --> it prints me exactly what I want to save / load
