I was implementing this code :
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_siamese_graph.py
But I want to view the embeddings from the last layer of output as in how the digits have clustered as they have shown in their paper.
I planned to use this :
import theano
get_activations = theano.function([model.layers[0].input], model.layers[2].output(train=False)
But I do not know what should be passed as an input.
Or if there is any other method to access those embeddings it would be of great help .
