My task is similar to the cbow approach, in that I have to predict a missing item of a sequence from the remaining sequence. The trouble is I do not know how to prepare my training data for the model. I have plenty of data (over 40k sequences)
Should I construct training examples by omitting a element and then train as in word2vec?
Or should I train a language model like objective and then use it to predict the missing item?
The issue is that I have a custom model in mind which treats this as a language modeling problem.
Is there a good example in keras to start with for training a custom language model?

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
