Hi,
I trained a model with more then one output, a gave names to all layers including the output layers. I passed the data to the model using dictionary to both input and output by the names I gave. When I use the model.predict() (with batch size 1) function the output is an array with length as the size of the number of outputs as desired, but with no names. I wish to see the output as an outputs with the names that I gave. Can someone help me with this issue?
Thanks,
Shai
