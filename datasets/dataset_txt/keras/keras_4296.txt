I am trying to implement the following network in keras (this is an image from the caffe model for the same network)

Here the layer, loss-img uses the loss based on two different middle layers without any output. I was thinking of an implementation in terms of multi-output network but couldn't find any way to make one of the middle layers as output for another one (or will just a hanging merge layer without any output work?) .
I can provide more details on the use case, if needed.
