In keras, if i want my display the output for a given input low resolution image, what code whould i use?
I tried
predictions = model.predict_classes(c)
as well as
get_3rd_layer_output = K.function([model.layers[0].input],[model.layers[2].output])
layer_output = get_3rd_layer_output([c])[0]
However, both of these do not work.
