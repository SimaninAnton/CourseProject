The original network which I have its weights stored in file 'weights.h5', I make a new network where the top layer = the desired layer as I removed the fifth layer and I intended to load the weights and do a forward pass and record the output
Now I am trying Load the model weights:-
When using
model.load_weights('weights.h5')
I got the following error:
ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 5 layers into a model with 4 layers.
However
model.load_weights('weights.h5', by_name=True)
worked fine
is this o.k.?
