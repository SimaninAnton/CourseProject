I am trying to compute the dot product of a matrix (Y) and a vector (alpha) using keras. The matrix was the output of a LSTM with return_sequence=True passed through a TimeDistributedDense. The code is here. I am implementing the model from this paper.
model.add_node(LambdaMerge(get_R), name='r', inputs=['Y','alpha'])
where
def get_R(X,Y):
    return K.dot(X,Y)
But I get the error,
TypeError: __init__() takes at least 3 arguments (2 given)
What am I doing wrong here? Seems like LambdaMerge does not work well with Graphs?
