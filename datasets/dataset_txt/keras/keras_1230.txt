I'm trying to get some kind of uncertainty measure of a CNN's output based on Gal & Ghahramani 2016. According to an other issue (#1606) it's easy to leave dropout on during test time, via:
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: K.dropout(x, level=0.5)))
I was wondering how to extend this to SpatialDropout2D() applied to the convolutional layers, since I get pretty bad results when I start to increase the dropout probability of the convolutional layers...? @fchollet
Would that make sense from the mathematical point of view? @yaringal
