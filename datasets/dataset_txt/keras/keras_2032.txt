Hi,
Although it has been subject of many correction, the problem still there, and I can't save the model with Lambda layer, using fit_generator. If I use fit (no batches) the problem don't occurs.
Error message:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'rawunicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 80-84: truncated \uXXXX
If I switch to BatchNormalization, the model can be saved, but the loss is much higher then using a simple normalization, like X / 255 - 0.5 .
