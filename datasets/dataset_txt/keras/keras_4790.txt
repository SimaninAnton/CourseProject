Sorry if this is something that's become more obvious with the functional API but I'm trying to train networks with >100 outputs and for each sample I only get labels for a random subset of those outputs (often more than 1 but rarely more than 10). Do I need to use a custom loss to zero out loss contributions from missing outputs or is somehow already handled within the Model class?
Thanks!
