The main code is as follows:


I make a model which has 3 input and make vgg-16 be its feature extractor.
I want to do similarity measure after feature extraction.
But I failed to train it on the official vgg model and successfully train it on my own sequential CNN model.
The loss is always const.
I change the lr to 1 but the problem always exists.
I think it's a bug in keras.
