I want to merge a input tensor and a sequential model. Do you have any idea of how to implement it?
Here is my code, but it doesn't work as keras cannot merge a tensor with layer:
model1 = Sequential()
model1.add(Dense(8))
model1.add(Activation('relu'))
input2=Input((3,))
model_merged=Sequential()
model_merged.add(Merge([model1, input2], mode='concat'))
model_merged.add(Dense(8))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
......
The error is :
AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'get_output_shape_at'.
If there is no way to merge the tensor object with layers, could I make the input tensor as a layer so that it becomes a task of merging two layers? How to do that?
Great thanks~

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
