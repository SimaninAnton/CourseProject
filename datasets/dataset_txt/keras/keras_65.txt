Using tf 1.13.1 and tf 1.15. I have to have a loop to do my own training (e.g. i call model.train() to train my model). Do I have to do anything other special when using BatchNormalizationi n my model when training like this? I am assuming it takes care of handling the training/test state internally. Is this correct?
EDIT 1: So it turns out that the keras source does not update the variables for the EMA unless you are using model.fit(). Using model.train_on_batch() will result in the EMA variables not being updated. The keras documentation should specifically mention this.
