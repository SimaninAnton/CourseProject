Recently I have installed keras and run the example code of lstm for text generation succssefully, I want to change the model from LSTM to RNN, but when I change the import code, it cannot run, specifically,
in the example code, there is :
from __future__ import print_function from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Dropout from keras.layers import LSTM from keras.utils.data_utils import get_file import numpy as np import random import sys
but after I change from keras.layers import LSTM to from keras.layers import SimpleRNN, the spyder IDE indicates redline under 'SimpleRNN' and cannot work,I'm really confused, can anyone help me, thanks in advance!
