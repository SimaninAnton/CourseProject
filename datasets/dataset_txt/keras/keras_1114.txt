UNet, I have a list of 670 different size RGB images(X_train) tensorflow backend
X_train=[]
img = imread(path + '/images/' + id_ + '.png')[:,:,:3]
X_train.append(img)
inputs = Input((None, None, 3))
if i use
results = model.fit(np.array(X_train), np.array(Y_train),
validation_split=0.1, batch_size=8, epochs=30)
then i get
Error when checking input: expected input_14 to have 4 dimensions, but got array with shape (670, 1)

Error when checking model input: the list of Numpy arrays that you are passing to your model is not the size the model expected. Expected to see 1 array(s), but instead got the following list of 670 arrays
