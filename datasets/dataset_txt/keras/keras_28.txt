trying upload just one function from eras take me considerable time
this is on ubuntu 18.04 under aws
other functions such as bumpy are ok
this is the only line of code I expect it to be much faster maybe 0.2 sec not 1+ why is it like so and is it solvable? how ?
I hope this is a legit question I looked on the internet and did not find any hint of what to do.
