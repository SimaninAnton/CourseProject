Hi, I have gone over some paper that talks about feeding text data of two languages or (text data plus image data) to a CNN/RNN. I am aware of the approach of creating two CNN/RNN branches for two input. However, does it make sense to treat data of the 2nd language as another channel in image data and feed it to one CNN/RNN only? Can it be done in Keras? Can anyone provide an outline on how it can be done in Keras? Thanks.

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
