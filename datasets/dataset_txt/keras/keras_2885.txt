Would it be possible to expand the 'Model' layers for visualisation purposes? At the moment they only display 'model'.
Here is some example code of what I mean. Here is the output for what I am trying to describe:
This is plot_model output for the final model:
This is plot_model output for the 'inner' (model_1 from above) model:
What I am asking is to produce the 'inner' model within the graph of the final model. i.e. display the layers of model_1 (as described in the second figure) within the final model (first figure).
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
