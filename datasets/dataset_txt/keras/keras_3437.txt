I am having trouble using regularizers in Keras.
I want to add L2 weight regularizer to LSTM models, I am testing with the code in the examples folder and here are the results:
mnist_irnn.py: the regularizer works fine
imdb_lstm.py: the regularizer works fine
addition_rnn.py: adding the regularizer does not affect anything
babi_rnn.py: adding the regularizer does not affect anything.
The regularizer is added by:
model.add(RNN(HIDDEN_SIZE, U_regularizer = l2(0.1), input_shape=(MAXLEN, len(chars))))
So how to correctly use regularizers in Keras? My goal is to implement a custom regularizer, if I could use L2 regularizer, is it straightforward to switch from L2 to my custom regularizer (assuming that the implementation is completed)?
Thank you.
