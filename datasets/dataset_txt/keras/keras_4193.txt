Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).

I'm on the latest version of Keras and this happens even if the graph is not empty. If this is a bug and it can be reproduced by others too, then I can try to work on this.
