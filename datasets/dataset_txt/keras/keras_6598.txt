I am trying to train a MLP model using keras. They take a sequence of integer vector as input data, which is an index of a present word if the target data are text documents.
In addition to these features, I have a word embedding vector for each document, which is a 200 dimension of real number that I also want to include in the input data. Since these weights cannot be indexed, how should I encode this as input data?
