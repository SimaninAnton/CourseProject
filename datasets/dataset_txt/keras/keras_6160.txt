Hi,
I'm trying to build a graph with multiple outputs and also masks. During model creation, Theano gives me float64 warnings (as I told it to raise those exceptions in .theanorc). The blamed op resides in weighted_objective() defined in models.py:
...
if mask is not None:
  score_array *= mask
...
If I cast the mask to K.floatx() everything seems to work fine. Am I doing something wrong or should I send a PR for this?
