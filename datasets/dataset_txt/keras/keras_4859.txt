for now, keras deconvolutions are implemented as convolutions followed by upsampling with repetition. There are faster and more efficient ways to implement them (plus results seem to look prettier) :
Tensorflow:

Theano:
https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code/blob/master/lib/ops.py#L85-L96
Same thing for conv3d. Now tensorflow supports them:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/api_docs/python/nn.html#conv3d
Anybody down to wrap them up in a Keras backend op? If not I'll do it later this week/early next one.
Thanks!!!
