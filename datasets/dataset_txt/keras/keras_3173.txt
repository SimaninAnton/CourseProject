Hi,
In the documentation for the TimeDistributed wrapper, it says
 The input should be at least 3D, and the dimension of index one will be considered to be the temporal dimension.
I think this should either be
The input should be at least 2D, and the dimension of index zero will be considered to be the temporal dimension.
or
The batch input shape should be at least 3D [etc, etc]
Not terribly pressing, but, considering the docstring example provides a 2D input_shape arg, a tad confusing.
Thanks for your time,
Sean
