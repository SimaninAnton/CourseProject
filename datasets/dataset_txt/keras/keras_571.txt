The current Identity initializer will handle non-square matrices by repeating an identity matrix. It would be better to instead pad with zeros (same behavior as tf.eye).
As we do this we also need a way to make sure passing an Identity initializer to a RNN (with fused kernels) results in the correct behavior. This has to changed at the level of the build method of the RNNs.
