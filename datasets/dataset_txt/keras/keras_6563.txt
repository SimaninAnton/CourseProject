I just installed theano and all its dependencies as well as keras and all its dependencies...
when I want to run the test functions (e.g. test_graph_model.py) I get an error as follow
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test_graph_model.py", line 58, in test_1o_1i_2
    graph.compile('rmsprop', {'output1': 'mse'})
File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/models.py", line 581, in compile
    y_train = output.get_output(True)
File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/layers/core.py", line 305, in get_output
    s = self.layers[0].get_output(train)
File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/layers/core.py", line 411, in get_output
    return self.activation(X)
File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/keras/activations.py", line 20, in relu
    return T.nnet.relu(x)

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'relu'
I have the newest version of theano and keras... what could cause the error?
By the way the very same error appears in all test functions except test_datasets.py and test_embeddings.py
Thanks for your help!!
