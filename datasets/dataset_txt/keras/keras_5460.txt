Not an actual issue but a question.
I see that the optimizer configuration is no more included in get_config in the new backend compared to the old backend. This lead to model_from_json not building the model anymore and it was the case before.
So now, only the architecture of the model is serialized and not the optimizer. Sometimes different optimization methods could lead to very different results and it could be interesting to warn the users that they should also take care of this step.
I was surprised when I first reused these funtionnalities, should it be mentionned in the documentation?
