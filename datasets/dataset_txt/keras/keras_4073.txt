Hi,
I have this error while trying to call predict over batch of images:
model = VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None)
...
model.predict(batch, batch_size=20)
Exception: Error when checking : the list of Numpy arrays that you are passing to your model is not the size the model expected. Expected to see 1 arrays but instead got the following list of 20 arrays:
From Model class API, predict should generate output predictions for the input samples, processing the samples in a batched way.
