Up to Keras version 2.1.6 one was able to "convert" a sequential model to a functional model by accessing the underlying model.model.
Since version 2.2.0 this is no longer possible.
Can it still be done in some other way?
(In case you wonder why I would like to do something like this, I'm maintaining a library that relies on this conversion. )
