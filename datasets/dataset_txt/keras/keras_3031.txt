Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hello,
a time ago I've trained an autoencoder and saved the trained model (by the time I was starting, so Ive saved the json arch and weights). Now I've updated my keras and cant load the previously trained model. It pops the error ValueError: epsilon must be at least 1e-5, got 9.99999974738e-06 , pointing to a batchnorm layer.
If you want to reproduce the issue you can simply execute the following code (with the saved model (5.4mb):
from keras.models import Model,Sequential
import numpy as np
from keras.models import model_from_json
import h5py

json_file = open('cnn1.json','r')
loaded_model_json = json_file.read()
json_file.close()
autoencoder = model_from_json(loaded_model_json)
# load weights into new model
autoencoder.load_weights("cnn1.h5")
