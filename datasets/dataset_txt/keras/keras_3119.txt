import numpy as np
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, AtrousConvolution1D

inp = Input((100, 1))
M = AtrousConvolution1D(1, 2, atrous_rate=280, border_mode='same')(inp)
M = Model(inp, M)
M.compile('sgd', 'mse')

data = np.random.rand(1, 100, 1)
M.train_on_batch(data, data)
TensorFlow fails when atrous_rate is higher than ~280 with the following error message:
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:2742] failed to enqueue convolution on stream: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
Theano works perfectly.
Tested with multiple machines with TITAN X's and all pip packages upgraded to latest.
