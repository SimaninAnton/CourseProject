When running a model with more metrics such as recall and fbeta_score the logged results are exactly the same:
  59596/59596 [==============================] - 3173s - loss: 0.5636 - acc: 0.6712 - fbeta_score: 0.6712 - recall: 0.6712 - val_loss: 0.5500 - val_acc: 0.6742 - val_fbeta_score: 0.6742 - val_recall: 0.6742
Surely these should be different?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
