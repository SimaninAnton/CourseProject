In theano, I can make a layer which declare two tensor variable and just add them up. And then use the result as the input of next layer (hidden layer for example).
Here is an example I wrote by Theano:
class PlusNoiseLayer(object):
    def __init__(self, theano_rng, speech_spec, noise_spec, noise_raito_low, noise_ratio_high):
        ratio = theano_rng.uniform(low=noise_raito_low, high=noise_ratio_high)
        mixed = (speech_spec + ratio * noise_spec)
        self.output = mixed
Sorry for my poor English expression and please help me. TAT
