With theano backend, example code breaks in line 118 when loading VGG16 with an input_tensor argument, after commit.
It traces back to line 980 in InputLayer.__init__, where auto-infer of shape K.int_shape only works for tf but not for th backend.
However, changing line 980 to batch_input_shape = K.get_variable_shape(input_tensor) doesn't work either, because the input_tensor in neural_style_transfer example is a K.concatenate of K.variable and K.placeholder - so the th version of get_variable_shape doesn't work with this compound type either.
Any idea of how to fix this?
