Hello!
I have a large time-series (each point is vector of length 30), and I need to predict the following time-series point using the previous ones.
So I have some amount of independent training sets (each represents a time-series of length 1mln+).
And I know that there is a long-term dependence of the points.
I'm trying to figure out how to use LSTM => Dense in this case.
First of all, I don't understand the issue of the input shape. I found that It should be (timesteps, 30) in my case. Does it mean, that if assume that the point Xi depends on the previous ten points, my i-th training example should be of shape (10,30) and include concatenateed X_i-10...X_i-1? It seems like a lot of replicated data. It seems like this "timesteps" should mean the length of sequence, while in my case I have a sequence of 1.2mln...
Also this is important because I'm going to use this model on the absolutely new data, feeding test examples one by one, so for the first points there will be no previous points.
I have also found the idea of the stateful RNN. Should I use it in this case? And if so, what about the shape again.
Thanks a lot!
