Hi guys ! I'm fairly new to keras, and was wondering how I can get the explicit labels of a prediction after I train my model. Let me illustrate my issue:
I train my model with the classic X_train and y_train, and y_train is an array whose form is array([[ 1., 0., 0.], [ 0., 1., 0.], ..., [ 0., 1., 0.]). But when I test it with the X_test matrix, I get y_pred = array([0, 0, 2, ..., 1, 1, 1]) .
Do you have a way to connect the dots? So that I know that 0 corresponds to [1.,0.,0.], 1 corresponds to [0.,1.,0.], etc
Thanks in advance for your help !
