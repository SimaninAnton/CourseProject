I have encountered some issues when using Keras with sparse input and non-aligned input (see below). I think it would be better designed if input can be more flexible, or I have to use Tensorflow's train logistics instead of Keras'.
For sparse input (with tensorflow backend), we have to pass tuple like (values, indices, shape), but this is not supported for some reason. Currently input has to be numpy array of same shape[0].
For non-aligned input, I use train_on_batch(), and input arrays are of different size (i.e. shape[0]), which will be adjusted/expended inside the computational graph model. Again, currently input has to be of same shape[0], which should be made more flexible.
FIX: allowing to drop the requirement for input to be numpy array of same shape[0] (which may disable train function but fine with train_on_batch function).
