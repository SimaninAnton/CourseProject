Is there any interest in either modifying the existing model class or adding a "wrapper" class (I'm leaning towards the latter as the better option) to implement the required methods and attributes to make keras more compatible with scikit-learn? To be clear, I'm referring to the requirements outlined here. No additional dependencies would be necessary, and it would allow developers already familiar with scikit-learn to use keras out-of-the-box alongside existing code/models. I don't think any of the current code would have to be touched to achieve this.
Thoughts? I can spend some time looking at this if there's a decent chance it would be accepted.
