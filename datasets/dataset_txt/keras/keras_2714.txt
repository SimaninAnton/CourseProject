My model is give below
1. define the network
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64,input_dim=50)) # try using a GRU instead, for fun
model.add(Dropout(0.1))
model.add(Dense(4))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.load_weights("logs/1layer/checkpoint-9957.hdf5")
I have trained a lstm network and stored the checkpoints and in testing I am loading the checkpoints to evaluate. So now i want to get the features for the train and test data to give those features to the LSTM network. Could you please tell how to do this? This is a kind request
