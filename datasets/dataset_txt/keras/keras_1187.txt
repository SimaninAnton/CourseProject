While implementing the following loss based importance sampling scheme for PTB language modelling task. There is memory leak error that happens. PFA the link to the [code](https://gist.github.com/kris-singh/5791a32e9b8132bae3d76794a19a649c. I do not understand how this is happening as I use batch_size=20 and sequence_length=20 and i have around 12gb GPU memory.
