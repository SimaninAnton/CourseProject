Hey there,
I'm having trouble loading in a hdf5 model.
When I load it in as follows:
model.load_weights('leafForm.hdf5')
habm_labels = model.predict_classes(habm_data)
I get the following stacktrace.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/osheak/Documents/neural-network-plant-trait-classification/software/neuralNetworkSoftware/allExperiments/cnnTestHab.py", line 73, in <module>
