I run the example code in MacOS and Ubuntu14.04, however, they both go wrong with
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'elephant.jpg'.
I know the reason is there is no such a file, but I don't know why I can't google it in the keras issue.
Only I met the problem?
from resnet50 import ResNet50
from keras.preprocessing import image
from imagenet_utils import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

img_path = 'elephant.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = preprocess_input(x)

preds = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted:', decode_predictions(preds))
# print: [[u'n02504458', u'African_elephant']]
