The input_shape was predefined as (samples, steps, input_dim). What is the meaning of steps here? And along which dimension will the linear convolution operation perform?
I have a training data with the shape (samples, dims). I want to perform convolution operations along the dims axis. How can I define the input_shape for the convolution1D as the first layer?
Thanks
