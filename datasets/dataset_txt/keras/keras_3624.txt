When built Tensorflow from source, the version appears as "0.12.head". This will fail various test conditions:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/callbacks.py#L526
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/callbacks.py#L531
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/callbacks.py#L541
Can I modified these lines to
if parse_version(tf.__version__.rpartition('.')[0]) >= parse_version('0.12.0')
or possibly something in the more elegant way? Thank you.
