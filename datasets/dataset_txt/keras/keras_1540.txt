With PIP installation of Keras, when using 2.0.9 (latest as of now), when importing Keras with tf backend, it allocates all available GPU resources immediately after import - however, in 2.0.8, the GPU allocation was not happening immediately after importing Keras. Is this an expected behaviour in 2.0.9?
