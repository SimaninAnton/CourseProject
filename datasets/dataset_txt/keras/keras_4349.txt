Hi,
I'm running the examples/imdb_cnn.py script with current master branch of keras and 0.8.2. Theano version.
However, the code is not learning anything. The loss does not go down and the accuracy stays at 50%.
The other example, for example imdb_lstm.py or imdb_festtext.py work as expected and achieve around 90% accuracy.
I suspect that something with the convolution or the max-over-time is broken in the imdb_cnn.py script.
Has anyone else the same problem?
