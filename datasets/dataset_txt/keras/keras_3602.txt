Hi Keras,
Thank you for this project!
It seems that you can't make the hidden unit and the output units of a SimpleRNN layer have diff√©rent values.
The doc says in the argument part :
"output_dim: dimension of the internal projections and final output."
It seems unclear to me what are "internal projections". Anyway there's only one argument of this type so it's clear you can't set the hidden state dimension as you want.
Is it wanted? What if I want a big hidden state yo remember a lot of information but a unidimensionnal output?
Merry Christmas :)
