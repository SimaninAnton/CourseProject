#I trained the model off the IMDB data set as seen in the example code https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_lstm.py
and saved the produced model with model.save as sent_model.h5
I load the model with model = load_model("sent_model.h5"), print "model loaded" to screen to see that it has been done without error.
and now can not find what I need to do to import text from a date.csv and be able to run a predict to get a sentiment analysis output. the 1st col in the csv is a natural language string and I would like to have the model attempt to analyse the sentiment using the training from the imdb data set but I can not find any guides or tutorials on how to take the text input and process it so that the model can predict from it. Can anyone please help me out?
