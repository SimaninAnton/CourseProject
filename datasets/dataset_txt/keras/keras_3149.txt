Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).

Hi all,
We are running Keras in a multi-user environment. However, due to some parallelizations, it is possible that the Keras base directory will be '/tmp'. This will cause permission issues on multi-user systems since the directory is not cleaned up after the job is done. Of course, we could implement some kind of hack, but this is not a very nice solution.
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/backend/__init__.py
As a result, I would propose the following change from
_keras_base_dir = os.path.expanduser('~')
if not os.access(_keras_base_dir, os.W_OK):
    _keras_base_dir = '/tmp'
to
import pwd

_keras_base_dir = os.path.expanduser('~')
if not os.access(_keras_base_dir, os.W_OK):
    _keras_base_dir = '/tmp/' + pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0]
This would solve possible permission collisions on multi-user systems. Let me know what you think.
Kind regards,
Joeri
