Hello, all. I just upgraded to Keras 2.0 and went to load a pre-trained ImageNet network from the applications module and received the following error:
  File "classify_image.py", line 28, in 
    model = VGG16(weights="imagenet")
  File "/Users/adrianrosebrock/.virtualenvs/keras2.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/applications/vgg16.py", line 111, in VGG16
    x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name='block1_conv1')(img_input)
  File "/Users/adrianrosebrock/.virtualenvs/keras2.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/engine/topology.py", line 545, in __call__
    output = self.call(inputs, **kwargs)

    x = tf.nn.convolution(
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'convolution'
The code to reproduce the error is:
from keras.applications import VGG16
model = VGG16(weights="imagenet")
Here are the relevant libraries via pip freeze:
Keras==2.0.0
tensorflow==0.11.0
I then tried using Keras 1.2.2 and TensorFlow 0.11.0rc2 from a separate virtual environment and the script executed without error.
I have also confirmed that both by image ordering is channels_last and my backend is tensorflow in the keras.json file.
