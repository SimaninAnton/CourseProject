It doesn't work.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "myFile.py", line 100, in <module>
    model = model_from_json(open('savefile.json').read())

Exception: Invalid objective: custom_loss_function
It is obviously trying to load the loss function from the relevant keras module, and not finding it.
How about adding some parameters to model.model_from_json? Something like model.model_from_json("savefile.json", loss=my_custom_loss_function) would be great.
More generally though, maybe we should add the possibility of giving a dictionary of named functions for all the custom functions the model might use: activation, loss, optimizer, ...
