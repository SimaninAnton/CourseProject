What's the best way to implement a margin-based ranking loss like the one described in [1] in keras? So far, I have used either the dot operation of the Merge layer or the siamese architecture described in #242 to calculate the similarity between two inputs. I am unsure how to extend these (or use another approach) to take into consider a corrupted pair of inputs. Any help is greatly appreciated.
