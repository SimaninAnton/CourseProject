Line 70 of applications/imagenet_utils.py (function _obtain_input_shape) seems to have a minor typo.
The block tests that the input has three channels. For example, the following model instantiation crashes with using Theano backend:
base_model = VGG16(include_top = False, weights = 'imagenet', input_shape = (3, 224, 224))
Proposed solution:
Now line 70 of applications/imagenet_utils.py reads:
if input_shape[1] != 3:
This should be
if input_shape[0] != 3:
Thanks,
