Hey all,
I have some import on my code such as from keras.layers.core import Input, Merge, ELU, InputLayer, and these were working just couple days ago. When I wanted to run it again, i saw it does not work anymore. I saw there has been a recent update so where can I find these in the updated version. Especially InputLayer was useful.
Thanks
