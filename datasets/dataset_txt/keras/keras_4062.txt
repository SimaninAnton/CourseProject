I'm trying to connect 2 functional API models together. here's the summary of the 2 models:
The First "Input" Model (It works as a single model just fine):
The Second Model that is supposed to be connected to the first model:
I'm trying to connect them together like this:
model = Model(input=generator.input, output=[discriminator.output[0], discriminator.output[1]])
But I get this error:
Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor discriminator_input at layer "discriminator_input". The following previous layers were accessed without issue: []
I tried to make a model out of them like this:
Model(input=[generator.input, discriminator.input], output=[discriminator.output[0], discriminator.output[1]])
But this code just resulted in the second Model (and not the 2 of them together), or at least this is what I think after getting a summary of the model and plotting it's structure.
can we do this in Keras (connecting functional API models) or is there another way?
Thanks
