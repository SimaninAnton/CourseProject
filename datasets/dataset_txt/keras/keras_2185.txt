Hi,
I believe there is an error in the example called Fine-tune InceptionV3 on a new set of classes.
Specifically, it says:
# we chose to train the top 2 inception blocks, i.e. we will freeze
# the first 172 layers and unfreeze the rest:
for layer in model.layers[:172]:
   layer.trainable = False
for layer in model.layers[172:]:
   layer.trainable = True
However, let us consider the following code:
from keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3
from keras.utils import plot_model

model = InceptionV3(include_top=False)
plot_model(model, to_file='model.png')

for i, layer in enumerate(base_model.layers):
   print(i, layer.name)
The model.layers[172:] does not correspond to the last two inception blocks, more like 4 and a half. I believe this is an error in the documentation. Can anyone confirm that my process is correct?
