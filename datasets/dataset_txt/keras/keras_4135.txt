Hi,
I have a Function, call it DetermineLearningRate that takes in the accuracy (and other metrics) at each iteration and gives the learning rate to a simple CNN.
Workflow
Simple CNN where DetermineLearningRate() would take in the accuracy and return a learning rate.
The TensorFlow Graph of the CNN would take in the learning rate and run 1 iteration and return the accuracy
This repeats until all iterations over.
Do I've to recompile 10,000 times if I've 10,000 batches? I tried callbacks and they don't work because the iterations don't wait for my functions to take in the accuracy (and other metrics) and return the learning rate.
