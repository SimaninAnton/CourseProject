Hi all,
I'm a bit confused about the image preprocessing that is required in order to use the weights of the pretrained VGG-16 model in Keras. According to https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py the main image preprocessing operation required is to subtract the mean color, as computed on the training dataset. This is in agreement with the original VGG paper from Simonyan.
But, in the following examples:

https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
there appears to be some scaling of the image to [0,1] from the original [0,255] range, but no subtraction of the mean color.
Which one is the correct preprocessing operation for pretrained VGG-16 in Keras?
