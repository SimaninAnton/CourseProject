Not really an issue, but I haven't found any documentation on how to access the hidden state in LSTM RNN.
Context: I want to capture the semantic meaning of a sentence, by feeding in the Glove word embedding vectors ( https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/pretrained_word_embeddings.py ) into the RNN and when the sentence ends, the final hidden state captures the so-called sentence embedding. I want to access this vector obtained from the final hidden state.
