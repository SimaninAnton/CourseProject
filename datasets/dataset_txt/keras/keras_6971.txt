This might not be the place to raise the issue or it might already be raised, in which case I apologize.
Looking at the examples, there is one for a simple RNN. Looking at the documentation, it says the RNN is looking to accept a 3d tensor of (nb_samples, timesteps, input_dim). Is there an example of how to load data into this to fit it?
Specifically, I am looking to process signals. I have a collection of them and they all go on for X time steps and are only 1 signal. Does that make the input_dim just 1 & the timesteps X?
Thanks in Advance
