Hi,
I am searching for a command which is similar to python "numpy.where()" command. Basically my idea is to extract the indices from a tenser. In python I can do simply f_j=(np.where(X==j)) which gives me specific indices(f_j) for the value j.
ex: X= [0 1 1 0 0 2 3 ]
f_j=(np.where(X==1))
f_j= [1 2]
Is there is any similar function which I can use for this purpose?
I tried to write array search inside a tensor. However I end up with error when calling "if K.equal():" line as
TypeError: Using a tf.Tensor as a Python bool is not allowed. Use if t is not None: instead of if t: to test if a tensor is defined, and use TensorFlow ops such as tf.cond to execute subgraphs conditioned on the value of a tensor.
def loss(y_true, y_pred):
b=K.equal(y_true,0)
b=K.cast(b,dtype='float32')
for i in range(0,5):
if K.equal(b[i],1):
........
y_true = [0 1 1 0 0 2 3 ]
