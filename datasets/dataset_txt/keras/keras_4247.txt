What
Small refactor of ImageDataGenerator to add output transformation.
Why
Working on common problem like buildings or facial key-points detection require to transform the output while generating augmented #images.
The way ImageDataGenerator is implemented don't allow this, other than some anti-pattern (like transforming points to a mask, fixing seed and extracting points from the mask).
How
I have already made an implementation: #3952
It basically boil down to moving the random variables generation to it's own function, and using the values to transform the images. The value are also passed to target_transform, a first order function.
