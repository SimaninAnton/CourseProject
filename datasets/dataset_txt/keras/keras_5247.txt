I tried to generate model predictions using a trained model as follows.
model = model_from_json(open('model_architecture.json').read())
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='SGD')
model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')

#load data into test_data.

pred_label = model.predict_classes(test_data)
I get a warning from Theano after I run model.predict_classes.
UserWarning: theano.function was asked to create a function computing outputs given certain inputs, but the provided input variable at index 1 is not part of the computational graph needed to compute the outputs: keras_learning_phase.
Any idea what the warning means and its potential implications?
