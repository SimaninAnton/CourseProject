Hi people.
I'm new to both Neural networks and Keras.
I'm working on ipython notebook & Windows 8.1 on CPU.
I'm getting this error while trying to train the network:
AssertionError: AbstractConv2d Theano optimization failed: there is no implementation available supporting the requested options. Did you exclude both "conv_dnn" and "conv_gemm" from the optimizer? If on GPU, is cuDNN available and does the GPU support it? If on CPU, do you have a BLAS library installed Theano can link against?
I've looked at similar issues on Theano/Keras github issues page.
Almost all the solutions pointed towards updating Theano & Keras.
I've tried updating both of them, and that didn't resolve the issue.
Is the issue in how we give the images to the training function(model.fit)?
In what format should the 2D grey scale images be given as the training set?
Could someone please help me out in fixing this.
Please find the link to the code & error here
