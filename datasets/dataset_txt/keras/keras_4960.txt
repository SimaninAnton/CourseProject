Hi,
I was trying to define a sparse input layer using tensorflow.
SparseTensor(indices, values, shape)
I defined Input layers to accept indices, values and shape. The model seems to compile, but I get issues with input/target size mismatch.
The input is always the same shape in this case, while the target depends on the batch size. Do you have any tips on handling this situation ?
