I have a network that predicts images Y. How can I output to file all the predicted images in each batch, so that I can monitor the progress during training?
My current understanding is to write a callback that calls self.model.predict_on_batch(X) in the on_batch_end() routine, but I am not sure where the actual batch data X is going to be? (In my case, I have a custom generator creating X, and the model is fit using fit_generator().
Does anyone know how to do this, or are there any examples? Thanks!
