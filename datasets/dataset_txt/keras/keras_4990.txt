As title, is it available to access last time step when recurrent layer's option,'return_sequences=True'?
(As following picture, since deep recurrent need each time step, 'g' need only last time step)

Besides,
can keras merge 2D shape(ex: (None,300)) and 3D shape(ex: (None,10,300)) do column-wise cosine similarity? That is, I'll get output_shape = (None,10)
