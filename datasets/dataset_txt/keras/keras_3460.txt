This board is not too bad, but for me it's obvious that stackoverflow is more suitable for question/answers cuz..
well, in general, it's the best q&a platform for programmers
maybe better search engine optimisation, so no repeating questions
answers are editable
Then we could use here for more like really issues of Keras.
