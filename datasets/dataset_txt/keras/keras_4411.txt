Is there a way to allow a custom cost function to access the model or the inputs or additional per-instance data in addition to the outputs and the targets in a backend-transparent way, i.e. in a way that
can be made to work equally well for Tensorflow and Theano?
My immediate need would be to access separate per-instance misclassification cost information that is only used by the cost function, not as inputs or targets.
I think providing a flexible standard way to do that would be good since the point of a custom cost function may be quite often to make use of additional information that goes beyond just the outputs and targets?
