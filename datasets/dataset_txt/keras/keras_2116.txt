Hi,
I am using Keras (2.0.4), tensorflow-gpu (1.1.0) on Win7 64bit
I am running the following code https://gist.github.com/anselal/7f7b9a7f458684acc14cf6837f64f6f4
It is a MLP digits classifier. I want to do a gridsearch with StratifiedKFold but I get IndexError: too many indices for array. If I use KFold the code runs without any errors. Am I missing something or is it normal ?
