Hi, I want to implement a network of a Siamese network-like structure, as depicted below. I saw this closed issue here : https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/928 , but it seems those commits were not merged, so there is no inbuilt support in Keras to implement a siamese network.
Is it possible to do this in some other way?
