I ran this code several times on different PCs recent days, but the code was not able to correctly generate samples. All the samples that generated are all pure black, that, only a black image.
I ran the code for 50 epoches, on keras 2(recent updated) , both theano and tensorflow backend were tried.
And I noticed that in the code, the set "discriminator.trainable = False" in done in line 160, but seems never set to be True in the "for" loop of training. So is the discriminator is initialized but never trained during the process?
