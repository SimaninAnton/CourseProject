Hello,
Is it normal that when i use a MLP to make a regression (with time series like sunspot) they are only 'loss' and 'val_loss' that decrease during the training ( acc and val_acc are always at 1.0000) ?
for information, I put a linear activation on output layer (which have only one neural) with mse and each hiden layer have 'relu' activation and dropout
thank you to anybody can give me a good reason :)
