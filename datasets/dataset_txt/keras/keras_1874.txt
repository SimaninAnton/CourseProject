Hi All,
So basically, I am fairly new to programming and using python. I am trying to build an ANN model for which I have to use Tensor flow, Theano and Keras library. I have Anaconda 4.4.1 with Python 3.5.2 on Windows 10 x64 and I have installed these libraries by following method.
Create a new environment with Anaconda and Python 3.5:
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 anaconda
Activate the environment:
activate tensorflow
After this you can install Theano, TensorFlow and Keras:
conda install theano
conda install mingw libpython
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
Update the packages:
conda update --all
All these packages are installed correctly and I have check them with condo list.
However, when I am trying to import any of these 3 libraries (i.e. Tensor flow, Theano and Keras), it is giving me the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
import keras
ImportError: No module named 'keras'
I would greatly appreciate the help to solve this issue as I am stuck and can't proceed forward. Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Atif
