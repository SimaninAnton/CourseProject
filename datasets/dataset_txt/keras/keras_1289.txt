I have a somewhat complicated cost function which includes terms for auxiliary outputs. Some of the auxiliary outputs come from layers with multiple output nodes (because the same layers are used multiple times in the pipeline).
So far, so good. Now my question is, Is there a way to specify which output nodes (i.e. specific tensors) my loss function will be applied to?
