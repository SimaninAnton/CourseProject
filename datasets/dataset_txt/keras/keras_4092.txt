I'm using Keras with TensorFlow to train a large number of tiny networks (~4 layers, less than 30 nodes in each layer). Currently TF allocates all GPU memory to a single process and therefore prevents me from opening more learning processes in parallel. I found on TF document that I can use
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = tf.Session(config=config, ...)
to do this. However, I wasn't able to integrate that into keras. Does someone know the way to initialize a tf session on keras? Thank you very much!
