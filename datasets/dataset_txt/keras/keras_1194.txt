I am new to GitHub and machine learning. Please forgive me if I post anything stupid.
Currently, I studying Inception-v3's architecture. But when I try to display the summary of the network, the output shapes of the layers seem too large to be shown completely.
Please see the below image.
Only the last two layers: predictions and avg_pool, with a smaller output shape displays correctly.
How to fix this problem?
Here's the code that leads to my problem.
from keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from keras import backend as K
base_model = InceptionV3(include_top=True)
base_model.summary()
