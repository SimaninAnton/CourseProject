If I were to follow the guide and integrate with my TensorFlow workflow (https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html) as with others, you cannot access the weight variable because we won't be building the model as shown in the guide. We're merely using the layers. There is no need to compile when we use it as a simplified interface to TensorFlow. How then do we access the weights (variables)?
Because if we use with TensorFlow like the guide, we do not call Model or Compile but merely use the layers to build.
