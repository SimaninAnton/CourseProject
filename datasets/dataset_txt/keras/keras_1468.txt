I'm trying to use the Tensorboard callback to visualise my embedding layer. However I get an error: ValueError("No value found"). I'm pretty sure this is because the layers are searched only in the layers within the top model. In my model however the embedding is within a submodel which is within a TimeDistribution layer. Is it possible to get this deeper level layer? Many thanks.
