This is a pre - PR issue. Recently, I managed to come up with a model which gives 100% on the babi task single supporting fact 10k in 30 epochs. But each epoch takes 40 seconds on CPU. Current example takes only 3 seconds per epoch, but requires 120 epochs to reach 97.5%. Also, the model deviates too much from those described in the paper. Should I PR it? If yes, should I update the existing example or add a new one?
