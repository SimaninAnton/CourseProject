here is a simple example for demonstration of the problem
https://gist.github.com/Alireza-Sedghi/343705ac76138337068d7df21adb97e4
basically it is a convolution layer (16 filters of 3x3) after the input of 32x32 +global averaging after it
based on (https://keras.io/layers/pooling/#globalaveragepooling2d) it should generate the output with the (nb_samples, channel) shape but it is not happening in 'tf'
the first part of the provided smaple code, ('th'), will generate a tensor with the shape of (None,16) -> correct
the second part ('tf') will generate a tensor with the shape of (None,30) -> incorrect
any ideas? this is happening for GlobalAveragePooling3D also !
