Hi,
I was wondering if there is an example for an lstm layer that eventually feeds into a regression output layer. I am having a hard time putting one together.
I am hoping to feed in one sample at a time, where sample looks like this:
input: [[x,x,x,x],[x,x,x,x],[[x,x,x,x],] output: [y]
This way, I would expect an lstm layer that takes in 4 inputs and after 3 iterations produces an output h to feed into a regression layer.
Cheers
