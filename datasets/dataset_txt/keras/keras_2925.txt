Can we get some guidance on what the preferred dtype should be for masks? I'm assuming it's bool, because that's what gets returned by the Embedding and Masking layers. But it's a uint8 in Concatenate, which causes problems here if one of the inputs is masked and one isn't (because you can't concatenate a bool tensor with a uint8 tensor).
I'm happy to submit a PR to standardize this to bool, but it'd be nice to know for sure one way or another what the intended dtype is for masks before doing that.
