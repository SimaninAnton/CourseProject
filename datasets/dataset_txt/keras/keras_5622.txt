Hi all,
I have experienced a problem while using this implementation of VGG16 :https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3
The network is not the problem, I have some great results with it when I try to classify ImageNet.
I needed to load the model with the pre-trained weights which can be found there :

Then, I wanted to use the output values of intermediate layers.
But when I look at an output coming after a "relu", it happens that some values are negative. When I compute the np.min() of the output, I get -9.59634780884e-06
Here is a script reproducing the error.

I have tried to do the same thing, but without loading the weights, and the min of the output is 0.
Do you know where this problem could come from ? Am I doing a mistake while poping the layers ?
Bests !
