I wrote code to view the weights of a 784x10 dense layer (MNIST problem) before and after training for one epoch. The weights returned by get_weights() after training are the same weights that were returned by get_weights() before training. The gist. The issue is visible in the image below. After the test accuracy line, the image shows the weights before and after training. Note how the weights are static, but the biases, which were initialized at 0, change.
After I observed this behavior, I upgraded Theano and Keras, but the problem remains. My current setup:
Keras 1.04
Theano 0.9
GPU Quadro K1100M
Cuda 7.5
cuDNN 5
