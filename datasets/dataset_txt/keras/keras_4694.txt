Is there an easy way to write generator extensions for Keras? I'd like to use some of the ImageDataGenerator preprocessing steps but also add some of my own such as randomly occluding areas of the image, adding noise etc. If not I can add some of these things to the ImageDataGenerator class in Keras, is that something that would be useful?
Also can I just double check that the ImageDataGenerator does indeed generate batches of examples in a non-locking way, thereby not causing any GPU training bottlenecks?
