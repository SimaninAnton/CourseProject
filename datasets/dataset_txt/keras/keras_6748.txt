This work reports very good results with using vanilla SGD when each layer is whitened as part of the optimization procedure. Sort of a fancier (and reportedly more effective) version of batch normalization. How hard would this be to implement in Keras? Algorithm 1 on page 4 looks like it might work within the layers API. Do I have that right?
