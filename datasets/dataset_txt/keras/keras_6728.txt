Hi,
Keras is quite amazing, thanks. But I can't find the right way to get output of intermediate layers. suppose I have trained a convolutional network and after the training I want to put the fully connected layers away and use the output of last convolutional layer, is it possible?
I've thought of using multiple outputs with Graph model but it demands training values for all of inputs which is not available in my case. Also load_weights method only works on models with identical architecture so it can't be used to load learned weights of convolutional layers to another model which only contains those layers
