I want to finetune resnet50 model. But my data's label are just binary, so I have to adapt new full connected layer on top of resnet 50's convolutional layers.
Conceptually, my situation is like below,
model = ResNet50(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')  # Functional API 
top_model = TopModel(model.output_shape[1:])
top_model.load_weights("top_model.hdf5")
model.add(top_model)  # => AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'add'
My question is,
Is there any easy way to stack 'Sequential based' model on 'Functional API based' model ??
I mimic following codes.
