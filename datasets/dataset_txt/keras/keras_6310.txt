Here is one thing about Keras, it always assume that output dimensions are (samples, dim) or (samples, time, dim). In the second case, when calculating the cost you vectors will be reshaped to (samples*time, dim). If you have something like (samples, time, dim1, dim2) they will be reshaped to (samples*time*dim1, dim2) which will average the cost function in a way we don't usually expect.
So, whenever we can, we should always reshape the output data to something like (samples, time, dim1*dim2*...).
Since the model compiles and runs without problem the user may think nothing is wrong. But we need at least a warning whenever the final output dim > 3.
I may work on that issue later, if anybody is already doing it, let me know. This fits requirements 3 in #1174
