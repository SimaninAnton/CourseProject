Hello
I really do not want to spam the Issue list, but however there is no mailing list or forum to ask about Keras :-( (if there is, please tell me).
I implemented the code as:
http://pastebin.com/BzECQR90
Basically, I have files as:
train_1, train_2, ...: each file contains a list of word, and each file corresponds to one document for training (there are ~25K files)
test_1, test_2 ..: each file contains a list of word, and each file corresponds to one document for testing (there are ~5K files)
train_number.txt: contains ~25K lines, each line is the score of the training document
test_number.txt: contains ~5K lines, like train_number.txt
I read these 4 files into variables in Python, and used fit_on_texts function to convert the words to frequency (similar with imdb example).
I also converted the train_number and test_number to categorical (there are 6 classes). You can see that in my code.
Then I ran the code.
The point is, the code tells me that the accuracy is 1.0 (100%), which is so great, but somehow unbelievable :-(. Of course, I hope that it is correct, but I am also afraid that I did something wrong.
If needed, I can provide objects X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test for reproducibility.
