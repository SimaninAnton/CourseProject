I'm having an issue where when I rerun lines above (trying to make a new model), when I try to fit, it prints the number of epochs n times, where n is the number of times I have fit the model since last restarting the kernel. Is there any way to stop this from happening? It's annoying when n=2, but gets hard to read outputs when n=10.
