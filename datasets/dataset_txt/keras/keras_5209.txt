Below are the definitions from the siamese mnist example (mnist_siamese_graph)
Why eucl_dist_output_shape returns shape1 when the euclidean_distance function is returning a single number (the distance) per pair.
Shouldn't it be:
def eucl_dist_output_shape_fixed(shapes):
shape1, shape2 = shapes
return (shape1[0],1)
def euclidean_distance(vects):
x, y = vects
return K.sqrt(K.sum(K.square(x - y), axis=1, keepdims=True))
def eucl_dist_output_shape(shapes):
shape1, shape2 = shapes
return shape1
