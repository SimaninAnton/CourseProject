We should consider moving the modules preprocessing and applications to separate repositories under keras-team: keras-team/preprocessing and keras-team/applications.
They would be listed as a dependency of keras, and would still be importable from e.g. keras.preprocessing.
Why?
They're not part of "the core Keras API" (which is about model building and training)
They're not really coupled to the rest of the codebase, so unbundling is safe
Faster CI runs, better test coverage
Unbundling makes it easier to develop in an open-source setting
Easier to sync across keras-team/keras and tf.keras (shared dependencies instead of code duplication)
Other projects might have need of Numpy preprocessing utilities
Any comments or concerns? Who would be interested in taking greater ownership of these repos, should they materialize?
