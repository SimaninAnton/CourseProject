I'm trying to reproduce some vanilla word2vec examples (e.g. CBOW or Skipgram) in Keras. Unfortunately, I got a bit stuck â€¦ and since it's such a common thing to do I was wondering if someone already wrote an example. The goal is to get the dense word vectors from a large corpus of (tokenized) sentences.
