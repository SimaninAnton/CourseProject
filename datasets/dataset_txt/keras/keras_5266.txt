I am working with a GAN-like model where I have a generator and a discriminator. Each of the models is a Model (using the new functional API). Both models work individually, but when I try to connect them, I get a MissingInputError telling me that an input to the graph is missing. That happens to be the input to the discriminator, which is the second model in the processing chain. I tried connecting the models both by using a Sequential object and by creating a new Model like this:
inputs = Input(shape=generator_input_shape)
generated = generator(input)
output = discriminator(generated)
discriminator_on_generator = Model(input=inputs, output=output)
Calling discriminator_on_generator.predict(batch) works properly, but discriminator_on_generator.train_on_batch(batch, targets) does not.
This was with the Theano backend (I cannot test the Tensorflow backend right now as I'm on a Windows machine).
Any ideas on what could be wrong?
