Hi,
I am pretty new to RNN and Keras. So my question may be a little bit naive.
Recently, I am doing some work on sequence-to-sequence problem. But my work is not about the translation or dialog system as previous papers stated. My data is like this:
I have several sequence of feature frames. They have different length
Each sequence was collected during one period.
Every feature frame has a label.
Now, I want to build up a RNN that when I input a sequence of feature frames, it will output a sequence of labels (one label per feature frame).
I have read some tutorials about training RNN with Keras. However, most of them are talking about segmenting (or padding) the data into sequences with fixed length; each sequence only have one label. Some others are talking about sequence to sequence by using two RNN (one for encoder, the other for decoder). These are different from what I need.
Does anyone have any experience about building up model for my case?
Thank you very much!
