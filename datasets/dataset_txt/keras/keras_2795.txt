Hello everyone. I am new keras user.
Nowadays i am practicing fine tuning works. (Pretrained model : VGG16, Train & Valid data: Pascal 2007)
I already have applied top_model's weight and vgg16's weight. i want to classify dataset into 20 classes
but i can't understand what i was wrong. i am looking forward to wait for your helps and advices.
This is my code.
This is my error message and model's summary.
