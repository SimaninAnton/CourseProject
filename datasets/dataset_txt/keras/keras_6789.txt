Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/px6e2nVv
I want the network to, when given a sequence of letters/digits, predict the next letter/digit. I want it to eventually produce meaningful language/grammar.
At the moment it produces this: http://pastebin.com/PwDamLS2 (I cut out epochs 101-900 because they're basically the same thing just a different epoch number). As you can see the result is just 1's. I looked at the original outputs before I round/int them. They are all the value "1.0", something strange is happening.
I tried looking at the input (before and after encoding), and it appears everything is working properly there. The input arrays aren't repeating, and the individual input values all have their respective numerical values.
