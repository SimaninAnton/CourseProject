I am following the KERAS application note on fine tuning, however I am getting a layer mismatch.
What is the best way to determine the difference in layers?
Thank you.
model = InceptionV3(weights="imagenet",include_top=True)
File "lib\keras\applications\inception_v3_fixedpath.py", line 288, in InceptionV3
if weights == 'imagenet':
File "lib\keras\engine\topology.py", line 2708, in load_weights
self.load_weights_from_hdf5_group(f)
File "lib\keras\engine\topology.py", line 2760, in load_weights_from_hdf5_group
str(len(flattened_layers)) + ' layers.')
