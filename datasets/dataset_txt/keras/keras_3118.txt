Hello,
I'm having a problem with keras 1.2.2. When I try to load a model I have just saved using
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath=(path + 'models/curr_model.h5'), verbose=0, save_best_only=True)
I get the error "ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 22 layers into a model with 26 layers". If I try to save after by myself on the same file, I get this message "IOError: Unable to create file "(Unable to truncate a file which is already open)".
When I save only the weights and load them also it does work.
