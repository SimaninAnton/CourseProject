Newbie to Keras alert!
I need to compute a recursive network's error just on the last time step of a network and have that BPTT to correct the network, can this be done by changing the objective function?, is there some better way?
I need a recursive layer that doesn't have all recursive connections in the sense that each neuron only knows it's last output and not the outputs of all the neurons in its layer, can this be done by creating a model for each neuron and then merging the outputs? Could I force some of the weights to remain zero?
