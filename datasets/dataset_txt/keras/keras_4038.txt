The recurrence formula in my RNN is h(t) = tanh(W.x(t) + U.h(t-1) + V.O(t-1) + b), where O(t-1) is the classification output (Softmax output) of the RNN at time t-1. How can I access this output at the next time step?
I guess I have to write a custom RNN, but I am a bit confused by all the recurrent functions in recurrent.py in Keras and I am not sure which parts should be modified.
