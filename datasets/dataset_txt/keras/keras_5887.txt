Can anyone explain the paramters involved in image captioning example in Keras.
The training data consists of images with 5 caption per image. Model gives prop distribution over next word given caption. So should I concatenate all 5 captions and pass that as sequence?
What does partial_caption here stands for and what is next_words? Is it one-hot encoded vector of next word after 1 caption out of 5? Also how to pass input at test time ?. I will only have image vector, but input requires [image, partial_caption].
