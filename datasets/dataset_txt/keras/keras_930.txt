I am trying to incorporate support for multigpu in keras. I tried reading the documentation available here. However, the examples are not mentioned correctly. It appears like this on my pc:
Example 1 - Training models with weights merge on CPU
$Example_2_-_Training_models_with_weights_merge_on_CPU_using_cpu_relocation$0
I am pretty sure there is some issue with it. Please fix this.
