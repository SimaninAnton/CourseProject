Hi, can someone shed some light on this issue. I've been trying to use the SVC from sklearn with KerasClassifier model = KerasClassifier(SVC, verbose=1) but I've been getting this error AttributeError: 'SVC' object has no attribute '__call__'. Has anyone else encountered this. I was hopping to use KerasClassifier in order to speed up SVC to use all available cores since its backend utilizes tensorflow but the above error is keeping me away from my goal.
