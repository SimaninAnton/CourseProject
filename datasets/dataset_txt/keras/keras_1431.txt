Are there any plans to support the MXNET backend in Keras 2?
I have used Keras 1 with MXNET backend and its performance (training time) for multiple GPUs outperforms Tensorflow. It is also much easier (in terms of coding) to build Keras models for multiple GPU training with the MXNET backend.
Thanks!
