Hi guys, I've trained a model on biological cell culture images in our lab.
The images were acquired few times a week since 2014 so we've a decent data-set.
The goal is to predict the class of the new cell images every week and to update my weights of the model with these new images.
Usually for this kind of problems I can re-train the entire model from scratch every time or just fine-tune the dense layers, but cell culture images are not 'dogs & cats' images.
The thing is that images from 2017 may slightly differ from 2015 imagery, and I want my model to be "as updated as possible".
One way of doing this I thought would be to decrease the dataset from previous year proportionally to the years - leave 300 images from 2015, 500 from 2016, and 750 from 2017.
Another way which I thought but have no idea how to implement this, is to set "weights" to the image's relevance. For instance, images from 2015 will have w=0.2, 2016 will have w=0.3 and 2017 will have w=0.5, that is: error in classification (MSE) of image from 2017 will be higher than mis-classification of 2 images from 2015 and the model will optimize itself accordingly.
Thanks!
