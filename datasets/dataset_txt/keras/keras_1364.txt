I have a problem with the way of creating my data for a NN with a LSTM layer. I have many files containing hundreds of lines. Each file represents a song and each line represents a note with 4 values. I want the NN read the notes with a sequence of 10 notes so that it can predict one note from them. If it is needed, we can fix the number of notes at 5000 per song.
So I just want to know which shape my input and output data should have and how to define the first LSTM layer.
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(32, input_shape=(5000, 4),return_sequences=True))
To sump up:
One file has 5000 lines and 4 columns and represents 1 song.
One line in a file represent one note with 4 values.
Thank you for your help.
