Hi,
I was using the following piece to report the training progress
class SlackerProgress(Callback):                                                                                            
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):                                                                                 
        hostname = socket.gethostname()                                                                                     
        msg = """End of Epoch {} in {}                                                                                      

*loss:*  {:.2f}                                                                                                             
*acc:* {:.2f}

*val_acc:* {:.2f}                                                                                                           

""".format(epoch, hostname,                                                                                                 
           logs["loss"], logs["acc"], logs["val_loss"], logs["val_acc"])                                                    
        slacker_message(msg)                                                                                                
This was working before, but after upgrading to latest master, it looks logs["acc"] isn't supplied anymore. It gives a KeyError. (I suspect it's related with show_accuracy being deprecated.)
It looks documentation in http://keras.io/callbacks/ should be updated with the keys as well.
Thank you very much.
