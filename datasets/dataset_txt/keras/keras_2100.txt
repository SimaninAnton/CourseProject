I wanted to modify the following keras mean squared error loss (MSE) such that the loss is only computed sparsely.
def mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1)
For instance, if output y_true is a 3 channel image, where the 3rd channel is non-zero at only those pixels where loss is to be computed. The loss is computed with the 2 channel image y_pred at only pixels where 3rd channel of y_true is non zero. Any idea if it is possible to implement a custom sparse MSE loss in Keras?
