I am studying Chinese stock market with binary classification with GRU, the traing samples is balance and the output is fine with class 1s and 0s, however, when i want to predict the real, almost all return is all 0s.
It is very strange the i have one mode can predict 2 classes with oneday, the predict output is similar to training data, which is fine.
when this mode is trained with more epoches, I try to use it to predict the same day data, it's predict data is all like 0.2-0.3, which means I get all 0s?
I prepare all real data with same code so it is hard to explain one day is fine and the others are wrong
Any idea?thanks
