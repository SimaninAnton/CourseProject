Hello,
I define this small network but it doesn't work:
inputs = Input(shape = (input_dim,) )
dense1 = Dense(output_dim, activation='relu')(inputs)
conv1 = Conv1D(output_dim, 3, activation='relu')(dense1)
dense2 = Dense(output_dim, activation='relu')(conv1)
model = Model(inputs = inputs, outputs = dense2)
model.compile(optimizer = 'rmsprop', loss = 'msle')
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
The error is: ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer conv1d_1: expected ndim=3, found ndim=4
So there anyone who could explain to me how to enter data's dimension?
Thank's :)
