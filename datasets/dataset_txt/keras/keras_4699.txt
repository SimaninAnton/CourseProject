I'm not quire sure if this is possible or not from reading through prior issues & some examples. Section III of this example: http://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html seems to suggest that multi-GPU support does work with Tensorflow, but in order for that to work do you have to drop into writing custom Tensorflow sess.run() code or can we use Keras model.fit or model.fit_generator in conjunction with this?
If we do drop into the Tensorflow sess.run() is it possible to combine this with Keras ImageDataGenerators for example?
