Hello everyone!
Would like to ask for your help in connection with the input format of the training data that is given to the model.fit() method (at the moment, I suppose that the problem exists because of the incorrect format). In the case of my task, I would like to build a model based on 120 records that have several hundred attributes.
Initially, I load in the data via pandas from an .xlsx file, and create a pandas.DataFrame from them. Since the .xlsx contains the records in a column-orinted way (so the rows denote the attributes), I transpose the read in dataframe after the load is done.
Now, the data still has the format pandas.DataFrame. My question would be about how to pass this dataframe correctly to model.fit(). The question comes up since the predicted values (talking about a regression task basically) really differ from the expected ones: the target variable is usually between 50 and 60, but the predictions fall into the range [-7, 7], and many times they are constant 0.
Don't understand the reason of this yet, but I hope you can tell me some ideas how to fix this. Let me know, if you would like to know about any further details. :)
(Of course, it's possible that the problem is with the model... And would like to share the code, if anyone asks.)
Thanks in advance for any help! :)
