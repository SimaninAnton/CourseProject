In example section of http://keras.io/backend/#batch_dot, it reads:
Assume x = [[1, 2] and y = [[5, 6] [3, 4]] [7, 8]] batch_dot(x, y, axes=1) = [[17, 53]] ...
It confused me for a while and later I refer to the comment of source (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/backend/theano_backend.py, L130),
and it should look like:
Assume x = [[1, 2]   and y = [[5, 6]
            [3, 4]]          [7, 8]]
I think mkdocs just views it as two lines and then combine them into a single line, so matrix should be written in a single line.
May you fix it and notice other potential bugs like this. Thanks.
