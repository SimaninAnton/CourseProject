I am learning to use Keras's Functional API . I tried running one of code snippet (ex: inception module ) from the documentation (https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/). I get the above mentioned error. I tried running other code snippets as well from the documentation. I get same error for each one.
Inception Module code snippet from the docs:
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Input
input_img = Input(shape=(256, 256,3))
tower_1 = Conv2D(64, (1, 1), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_img)
tower_1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(tower_1)
tower_2 = Conv2D(64, (1, 1), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_img)
tower_2 = Conv2D(64, (5, 5), padding='same', activation='relu')(tower_2)
tower_3 = MaxPooling2D((3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')(input_img)
tower_3 = Conv2D(64, (1, 1), padding='same', activation='relu')(tower_3)
output = keras.layers.concatenate([tower_1, tower_2, tower_3], axis=1)
I am trying to use Conv2D as the first layer in functional API setting. Can anyone please provide me some suggestion on how to resolve this issue?
Thank you.
