Now the skipgrams use only one thread, which makes it really slow for the large corpus, maybe we can use something like multiprocessing to speed it up?
keras.preprocessing.sequence.skipgrams(sequence, vocabulary_size, window_size=4, negative_samples=1.0, shuffle=True, categorical=False, sampling_table=None, seed=None)
or there are other ways can get this done?
