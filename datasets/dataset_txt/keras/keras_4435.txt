Hi. I'm trying to implement Facial landmark detection by deep multi-task learning(ECCV2014)
using Keras.In this paper, different tasks are stopped seperately. Is there any early stopping function used in multi-task learning in Keras？　If not, how can I write my own code to stop the training of specific task ?
Thank you ！
