Hello everyone, I was confused by this problem for several days...
My question is that why the training time has such massive difference between that I set the batch_size to be "1" and "20" for my generator.
If I set the batch_size to be 1, the training time of 1 epoch is approximately 180 ~ 200 sec.
If I set the batch_size to be 20, the training time of 1 epoch is approximately 3000 ~ 3200 sec.
However, this horrible difference between these training times seems to be abnormal..., since it should be the reversed result:
batch_size = 1, training time -> 3000 ~ 3200 sec.
batch_size = 20, training time -> 180 ~ 200 sec.
The input to my generator is not the file path, but the numpy arrays which are already loaded into the
memory via calling "np.load()".
So I think the I/O trade-off issue doesn't exist.
I'm using Keras-2.0.3 and my backend is tensorflow-gpu 1.0.1
I have seen the update of this merged PR,
but it seems that this change won't affect anything at all. (the usage is just the same with original one)
The link here is the gist of my self-defined generator and the part of my fit_generator.
Could somebody help me explain this problem...???
Thank you so much...Orz
