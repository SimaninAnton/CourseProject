I tried using callbacks but it seems that it take the difference of val_acc of two epoch and if the difference less than defined then it will stop. But, I want to stop the training when val_acc becomes 1.00.
so, how can I stop learning when val_acc becomes 1.00 for n(let's say 5 times ) times continuously.
