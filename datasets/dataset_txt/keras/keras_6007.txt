I noticed that there has yet to be an evaluation function implemented for validation data which uses a generator, from models.py line 1040:
# TODO: call self.evaluate_generator()
Motivation
Large validation datasets shouldn't be fully loaded into memory, only to be used at the end of an epoch (waste of memory). This feature would be quite useful in general for all applications.
Implementation
Evaluate the generator's next output by batches, with the user specifying an additional parameter in fit_generator to specify how many examples to evaluate from the validation set at the end of each epoch. Will add a function to the Model parent class so as to generalize to the Sequential and Graph classes.
Finally, as much as I've benefited much using Keras, I would also like to contribute back, hopefully by implementing this little feature successfully. As this is my first, would appreciate some guidance and any tips that you feel a beginner should know but might not!
p.s. I've read the CONTRIBUTING.md file :)
