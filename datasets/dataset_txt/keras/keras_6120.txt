Deep copying a model (TensorFlow backend) gives an error. Theano's backend seems to be working fine.
One possible solution would be to add a method __deepcopy__ to the Model class to teach the deepcopy function to operate on the model, in case the TensorFlow backend is being used.
One workaround would be to just pickle and unpickle the model. I guess that should work, but it looks ugly.
There are many reasons for wanting to deepcopy models. One of them related with the sklearn keras API, which as it is in PR #1225 will only work with Theano.
For more info on the error, one can check the output of a test introduced in the mentioned PR: https://travis-ci.org/fchollet/keras/jobs/100841387
