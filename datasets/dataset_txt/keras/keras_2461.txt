Hello everyone,
I scratch my head since yesterday on a strange bug. I copy/paste the code from the Building powerful image classification blog post (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html). For the first example, when I tried on my MacOS, it works well (using the CPU), but when I try the same code, same images (cats and dogs) on Amazon EC2 g2x2 instance with the same install:
Python 2.7.13
Keras 2.0.4
Theano 0.9.0
I got this error:
ValueError: ('The specified size contains a dimension with value <= 0', (-2176, 64))
The only difference is I am using CPU on MacOSX and GPU on Amazon EC2
Obviously, I checked keras.json and both backend and image_dim_ordering are set to theano and th.
I don't understand where the problem is, if somebody has clues. Thanks in advance
