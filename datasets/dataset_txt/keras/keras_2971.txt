Hello I am new in using keras. Today I works on video that exploit the LSTM method in keras.
I have input of coordinate array let say 68 points, so it will be (68X2) it is the dimension which input per frame. Then first run I will wait until 10 frames (should it be statefull LSTM?), then output one hidden unit (binary classification). So how can I code it in keras?, For example, let assume here I have 14 frames data, so I tried like this:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(1, batch_input_shape=(14, 10, 68), stateful=True, return_sequences=True))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
It still give me error. How I input the data dimension of (68X2)?, should I flatten it first to (136X1)?, how about if the feature is in 3-Dimensional for example (68X2X4)?
As long as input_shape should be in format [number_of_train, sequences, dimension]
How we visualize the architecture of LSTM?, I mean in here like visualize the architecture of network like in here : http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html which visualize the network in caffe prototxt. This will help me to make sure that my network is actually right implementation of my minds.
Thank you!
