from keras import backend as K #i'm using theano backend (K.variable(np.ones((3,22,22)))+K.ones((1,22,22))).eval().shape (K.ones((1,22,22))+K.ones((3,22,22))).eval().shape

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
