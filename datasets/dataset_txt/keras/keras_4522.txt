Hi,
I am training a 2 hidden layer NN and notice that the convergence is faster when using model.fit than using model.fit_generator. The optimizer is the same in both cases ('sgd') and my batch size is 32 in both cases. val_loss decreases much rapidly when using fit. Is this to be expected? Is val_loss calculated differently for fit_generator?
Thanks in advance
