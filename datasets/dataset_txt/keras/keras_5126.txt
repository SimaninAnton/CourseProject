Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to obtain the gradients of the output of the network with respective to the weights at a particular input. In other words, if we see the network as a big nonlinear function parameterized by the weights
how to obtain
where the above gradient would be a jacobian matrix with
number of rows = number of weights
number of columns = dimension of input
