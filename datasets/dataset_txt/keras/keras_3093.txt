In the conv layers, what is the initial value for bias terms?
The initializations of the weights are clear. but the initialization of the bias terms is not mentioned. How the bias term is initialized ? and what is the range of the random value?
The same question for the glorot_uniform, what is the range of the random values if we use glorot_uniform ( Ex : between 0 - 1 etc) ?
I am using the TensorFlow.
Thank you!
