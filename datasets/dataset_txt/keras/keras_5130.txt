Is it possible to have a scalar Input() instance?
I can use K.backend.placeholder(ndim=0) to get output from theano.function() correctly but cannot use the input defined by K.backend.placeholder(ndim=0) as it is not a Keras Tensor.
Is there a way to generate a scalar Input(), either directly or by converting the backend Tensor object?
