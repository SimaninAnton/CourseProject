Hi, do i need to re-compile model after changing the config of a model layer ?
For example, i have a layer Dropout(0.5), which is in the third layer, when i change its config like this;
cfg = model.layers[3].get_config()
cfg['p']=0.2
model.layers[3] = model.layers[3].from_config(cfg)
(ps: Is this a proper way to change the config of a model layer?)
do i need to need to re-compile the model ?
Thanks !
