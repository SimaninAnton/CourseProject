Hi,
I simply have two tensors a and b. Let's say a is 1005040 and b is 1003040.
My goal is to get the dot product of these two tensors through the time steps. My desired output will have size of 1005030.
If I use merge([a,b],mode=dot,dot_axes = (3,3)) it gives me a 10010050*30. I think there should be a way to run the merge in a time series manner.
Any ideas?
