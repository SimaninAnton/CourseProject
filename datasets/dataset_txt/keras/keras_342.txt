I have a problem with seven classes and my training data is labeled with probability labels. That is to say, for example I could have one image that may belong to class 0 with 30% of probability and to class 3 with 70%, so its label would be [0.3, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0].
The issue is that I have no clue of what loss measure should I use, because categorical_crossentropy should be used when each image belongs to a single class, and binary_crossentropy is usually used when each image belongs to one or more than one class (but for sure, not with a probability). For now I'm using binary_crossentropy because it seems more adequate.
Thank you for any help.
