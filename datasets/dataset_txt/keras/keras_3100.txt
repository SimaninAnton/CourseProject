I know it would be a stretch design-wise, but as for now I don't know how to get both predictions true labels when using flow_from_directory.
It seems a very small code change (just keep accumulating true labels after each batch), and I would be more than happy to open a PR if there is interest in this.
EDIT: it seems that via shuffle=False the data are in the same order of gen.classes and gen.filenames. If that's the case, I might just add some documentation.
