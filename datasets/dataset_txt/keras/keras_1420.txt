I have TensorFlow 1.4.0 and Keras 2.1.2. When I'm trying to execute this code
...
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same',
input_shape=(IMG_ROWS, IMG_COLS, IMG_CHANNELS)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(NB_CLASSES))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.summary()
...
I get the message:
WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py:1264: calling reduce_prod (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) with keep_dims is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
keep_dims is deprecated, use keepdims instead
Could you fix it?
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
