Guys I've upgraded my keras and theano to keras 2.0 and theano 9.0. I've tested GPU and it works fine, the test script is ok. I've also installed cuDNN 5110 and it works fine too.,but the script runs too slowly. I've even used some configuration in theano to make the performance better:Forced to use dnn, to use float32 (warn if float is 64), made some optimizations, but the learning process goes too long anyway. I had a CNN with about 16 layers (2 FC layers).With keras 1, the 1 epoch took ~1m, but with keras2.0 it takes ~3.24m.Is there any idea how I can make the speed better? almost all tests related with theano and gpu run without any problem.
