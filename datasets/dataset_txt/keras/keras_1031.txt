The findings are simple: for Keras-gpu=2.0.8, we can have the same list of augmented data generated with fixed seed (e.g., 1); for the later versions, > 2.1.2, the generated list is somewhat random even the seed is fixed.
train_datagen = image.ImageDataGenerator(
rescale=1./255,
rotation_range=0,
width_shift_range=0.2,
height_shift_range=0.2,
shear_range=0.2,
zoom_range=0.2,
horizontal_flip=True,
vertical_flip = True,
fill_mode='nearest')
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
train_data_dir,
target_size=(img_height, img_width),
batch_size=100,
class_mode='binary',
save_to_dir='augmentedData',
seed=1)
