Hello! I'm having a particularly hard time figuring out how to get the output from a model in Keras given a single input. For instance: suppose I create a sequential model with one convolutional layer, and I generate a random 'image' and I would like to feed it to the model and get the convolved output as an array. How do I go about doing this? I've tried something like "model.predict(x)" where x is the input, but then I am told that 'Sequential object has no attribute _predict.' In Torch, I could just do something like "model:forward(x)." What is the equivalent here?
Apologies if this wasn't severe enough to raise as an issue.
