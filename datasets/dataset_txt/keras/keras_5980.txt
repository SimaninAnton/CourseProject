For example, I want to initialize a layer of shape (2,3) with some weights:
hardcodedWeights = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(output_dim=3, input_dim=2, weights=[hardcodedWeights]))
This throws AssertionError: Provided weight array does not match layer weights (2 layer params vs 1 provided weights)
How should I correctly specify weights?
