Hi,
I am using a custom loss function with my keras model. In my custom loss function, it returns "an array" v with shape (num_of_sample, ) instead of a "scalar" likes those in https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/objectives.py.
But the model with this custom loss function can still be compiled and trained. I just wondering what happens in Keras when I return "an array" v in my custom loss function. Will it automatically adds code like K.sum(v) , K.mean(v) or v[0] ?
Thanks
