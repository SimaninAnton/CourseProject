Equation 1 of the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02351.pdf) defines the loss function to contain cross terms between the encoded and decoded layers. This is done so that there is dependence between the encoder and decoder. In examples/mnist_swwae.py the loss is computed between the initial input and the decoder output. Thus, missing the intermediate terms of equation 1.
