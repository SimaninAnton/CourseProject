It seems that the contrastive loss in the moist_siamese_graph.py is defined as
K.mean(y_true * K.square(y_pred) +
                  (1 - y_true) * K.square(K.maximum(margin - y_pred, 0)))
However, the loss defined in the original paper is
K.mean((1 - y_true) * K.square(y_pred) +
                  y_true * K.square(K.maximum(margin - y_pred, 0)))
where y_true is 0 if two images are from the same class, and 1 otherwise.
