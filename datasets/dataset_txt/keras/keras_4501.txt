Here is an implementation of the LSUV initialization https://github.com/ducha-aiki/LSUV-keras
Mishkin, D. and Matas, J.. All you need is a good init. ICLR 2016 http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06422
Id like to make PR, but dont know, which format suits the best. It cannot be just added to other initializations, because it needs to use train data and already compiled model for work.
@fchollet if you think that such PR will be useful, could you please give me a hint about possible format. Now it is used as following:
from lsuv_init import LSUVinit
...
batch_size = 32
model = LSUVinit(model,train_imgs[:batch_size,:,:,:])
