Currently, LearningRateScheduler parameter schedule must be a function that takes epoch index and learning rate as input arguments. When testing different learning rate annealing schemes, it is however sometimes useful to have a parametrizable schedule function that takes other various kwargs as inputs.
Currently, one alternative to use the current LearningRateScheduler callback with a parametrizable schedule function is to write a closure that returns a schedule with the appropriate input arguments (epoch, lr) and use the latter when calling the LearningRateScheduler constructor.
In order to make the LearningRateScheduler callback more generic, I think it could be useful to be able to pass additional schedule kwargs to the LearningRateScheduler constructor, therefore allowing for more parameterizable schedule functions.
If anybody would find that feature useful, I can write a PR for it.
