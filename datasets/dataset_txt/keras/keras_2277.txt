Hello, I would be most grateful, if you could give me some help.
I wrote a simple function in Keras and I still want to test it whether it works properly or not. How can I do that?
def cos_sim (inputs):
i1,i2=inputs
numerator = K.sum(i1*i2)
denominator = K.sqrt(K.sum(i12)*K.sum(i22))
return numerator/denominator
x = np.array([2,3,1,0])
y = np.array([0,8,6,9])
P.S I expected to get something like “0.595961149897” but with “print(model.predict([x,y],verbose=0))” I’ve got [ 1. 1. 1. 1.]
