Hi,
Ok so I saved a model in json with a custom activation layer. The model_from_json works fine if the model is loaded on the same machine, yet if I attempt to port the model to a different machine the model_from_json breaks.
If we look at the json file we see a pointer to the file that contains the custom function. Since we are on a new machine I changed the directory to point to the new file directory. This however does not work.
For what I understand this is because the custom function is serialised in the json file and I guess something else needs to be changed besides the directory.
Any help to make this work?
