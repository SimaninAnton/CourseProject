Can someone please confirm this case? Seeing the code and running some dummy experiment, it seems to me that the forward and backward RNN outputs are not time synchronized if 'return_sequence=True'. So when I timestep-wise concatenate the forward and backward outputs to encode something, it does not make any sense.
Thanks :)
