Dear Fchollet,
The installation exited with the following error:
Command "/usr/bin/gfortran -Wall -g -L/usr/local/lib -L/sw/lib build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scipy/cluster/_vq.o -L/usr/lib64/atlas -L/usr/lib64 -Lbuild/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7 -llapack -lptf77blas -lptcblas -latlas -lpython2.7 -lgfortran -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/scipy/cluster/_vq.so" failed with exit status 1
Please suggest the solution.
