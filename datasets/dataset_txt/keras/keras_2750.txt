There are some hard-coded assumptions in the current 1D global pooling implementations that I'd propose fixing, being: dimensionality (ndim=3) and the axis to pool over (axis=1). For a number of reasons, I'd like to make this a bit more flexible by exposing these as arguments.
I've already taken the liberty of implementing this on a fork/branch and written some test cases to verify it behaves as advertised.
Before submitting a PR though (I'm reasonably convinced it conforms with the design / style of the library), I wanted to open this up for discussion. Selfishly, this is all the functionality I need at the moment, but I wonder if there isn't some other low-hanging fruit here worth polishing, e.g. the non-global 1D pooling layers.
thoughts?
