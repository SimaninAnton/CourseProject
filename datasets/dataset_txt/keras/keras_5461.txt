I have just upgraded Keras, and trying to import a network I had saved as json (architecture) + h5 (weights). However, model_from_json throws a KeyError exception referring to class_name.

>>> from keras.models import model_from_json
Using Theano backend.
>>> model = model_from_json(open('models/complete2/architecture.json').read())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/migliorini/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/models.py", line 30, in model_from_json
    return layer_from_config(config, custom_objects=custom_objects)
  File "/home/migliorini/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/layer_utils.py", line 24, in layer_from_config
    class_name = config['class_name']
KeyError: 'class_name'
Keras and Theano are updated to the latest version. I was hoping not to have to train again the net.
Thanks in advance for the help,
