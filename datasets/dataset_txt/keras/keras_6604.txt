This issue is a place to discuss more about what callbacks can be created but the current implementation of callbacks and its probable limitations makes creating these callbacks impossible.
One particular case is discussed here #763.
To be able to reset the hidden state of an RNN not only after some predefined number of epochs, but also inside any mini-batch, requires that the callback have access to the mini-batch data.
What are other use cases? Is this particular case feasible at all?
