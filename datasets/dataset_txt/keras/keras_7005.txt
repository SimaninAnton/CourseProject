Hi,
Thanks for developing Keras - it's really awesome! I'm looking to use Keras for my research and have a question regarding implementing objectives that require negative sampling. For example, suppose I want to optimize the max margin loss as follows:
Ppos = model.predict(Xpos)
Pnet = model.predct(Xneg)
loss = T.sum(T.maximum(0, 1 - Ppos + Pneg))
Is there a way to do this in Keras?
Another example would be negative sampling, where we'd want to optimize something like:
loss = -T.log(Ppos)
for Pneg in Pnegs:
    loss -= T.log(1-Pneg)
