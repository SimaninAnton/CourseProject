Hi, while trying to give a tuple as my output_shape for a lambda merge layer
subt = Merge(name='subt', mode=lambda x: x[0] - x[1], output_shape=(None, n_output_dims))
I get the error
we cannot infer its output shape because no `output_shape` argument was provided
I'm using Keras 1.0. I'm not sure if this is a known issue / backwards problem, since the help text specifically says you can pass a tuple. I believe it is a pretty easy fix here, something like:
elif isinstance(self._output_shape, tuple):
    return self._output_shape
The error message also seems a bit misleading since it could be given if the wrong argument type is passed.
