I tried several ways but cannot get parallelization of sample / data generation to work successfully. Below is a gist. Am I doing something wrong, or is there a bug?

I suppose that my fourth try would be the correct one - but when I set pickle_safe=True, I get the error:
PicklingError: Can't pickle <function generator_queue.<locals>.data_generator_task at 0x000000001B042EA0>: attribute lookup data_generator_task on keras.engine.training failed
