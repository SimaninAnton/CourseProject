As of 6e03136:
        for s in sequences:
>           if s:
E           ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Tests pass because all the test data is in Python lists. @fchollet was this changed to also handle another case or was it simply for style? If it's the latter I'd say just revert to checking if len(s) > 0 instead of if s.
