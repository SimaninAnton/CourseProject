Running latest Keras 1.2.2, on either TF or Theano...
Code/comment below taken directly from https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(32, input_dim=64, input_length=10))

# for subsequent layers, not need to specify the input size:
model.add(LSTM(16))
Running the first two lines of code above throws no error. Then running the third line throws the following error:
"Input 0 is incompatible with layer lstm_2: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2"
...The code (and comment) in the documentation (linked) says that we do not need to specify input size for the second layer, so why am I getting incorrect ndim when I execute the second model.add() statement? Thanks for your time and any help is much appreciated.
