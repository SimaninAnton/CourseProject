I have a folder which contains 100 .npy files each file corresponds to a different class. The shape of each file when loaded is [L, 28 * 28] where L is of variable length. I use np.load to load the data but since I have memory limitations I have to discard some of the data. I want to train my model on all the data. From my understanding I can use flow_from_directory to load batches but I am not sure how to inform keras to load data as chunks of that format.
How to inform keras to load chunks from npy files ?
