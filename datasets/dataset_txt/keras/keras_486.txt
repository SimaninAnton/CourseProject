Hi there!
I wonder if it is possible to parameterize this threshold (hardcoded as 0.5):
keras/keras/engine/sequential.py
Line 271 in e11c48d
 return (proba > 0.5).astype('int32') 
Sometimes we intend to try different thresholds than common 0.5. I suppose this would be the case in which that value could be the default for a possible threshold param.
