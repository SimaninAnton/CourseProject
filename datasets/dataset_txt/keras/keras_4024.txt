I am using
TimeDistributed(Convolution1D(...), input_shape=(None, data_dim, 1)) as a first layer
and get an error. If I use the length of the sequence instead of None everything works,
but I would like to use this model for prediction of the sequences of arbitrary length afterwards.
Is it possible to not specify the length?
