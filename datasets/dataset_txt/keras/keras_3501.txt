From this line, I am not sure whether it allocates a new memory for the result. If so, one can use things like assign_add to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. I am asking about this because in my model there are many merge layer and I found out that it consumes much more memory in keras with tensorflow backend (twice as much that in Torch). Besides, GPU usage is at 50%-60% during training. I am doubting the memory allocation could be the bottleneck. Correct me if I misunderstood.
