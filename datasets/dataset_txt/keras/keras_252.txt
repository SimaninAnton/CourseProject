I have a video classification problem with 2 classes and I'm using a Resnet50 + LSTM architecture.
During training, the accuracy result of each mini-batch is pretty consistent and close to 100%. However after the network is already trained if I test the training dataset with the predict or predict_generator functions I get 100% accuracy for one of the classes and 0% for the other.
Does anyone have any idea why this might happen?
