I'm new to keras and I have a simple question:
For example, I want to encode a n-words sentence using Bidirectional LSTM.
As far as I known, the following code can return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence if return_sequences=True:
Bidirectional(LSTM(10,return_sequences=False), input_shape=(n,dim ))
So, my question is: how can I get the i-th words encode, which is also the i-th time step output of Bidirectional LSTM ?
