I see that a developer guide / style guide is listed in the "projects" area as a useful contribution. I was wondering if starting this on the github wiki would be a suitable place to put the work in progress, or whether you would prefer that to be started in the docs area, or just as a working doc on google drive or something until it's in a useful state.
