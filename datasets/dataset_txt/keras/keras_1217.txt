Hello,
I have latest version of theano and keras and I am trying to run script from keras from this page for learning purposes:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-word-based-neural-language-models-python-keras/
This first example of full code from the page.
When I run the code it work ok untill it starts training the model. Then python just stops executing without reporting any error. What could be the problem?
