hi~ all~
now i have train a model with max_iteration = 300
but when i finish the iteration i found that the loss and the accuracy is not as good as i expected.
but one iteration it will cost 3 minites, now i want to train the model with more iteration, i wonder if i can use the model i have trained on the last 300 iteration, and how i can use it?
is there anyone can give me some advices? thanks a lot in advance!
