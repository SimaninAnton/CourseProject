Hi,
That was my first time with keras and I encountered an error when following the "getting started" sequential guide.
I installed keras by first building my own numpy and then installing keras with pip. Then I tried to import keras module with a simple $python -c "import keras" but gives me that error :
First, it says me that it uses the Theano backend (ok),
Then it writes some python code (see that pastebin) (weird)
Finally it recommends me to recompile it with -fPIC gcc flag because it cannot : "relocation R_X86_64_32S against `_Py_NotImplementedStruct' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC." (what's going wrong?)
I would like to know how to add this -fPIC flag to the compilation line, or what's going wrong with my keras.
Thank
