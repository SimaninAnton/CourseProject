I am using tensorflow 1.0.1 keras 2.0 and python 3.4
When I run my code, it shows no error. However tensorboard show that "No graph definition files were found. "
My tensorboard debug is as follows:
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is in debug mode.
INFO:tensorflow:Starting TensorBoard in directory /home/swx/lk
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard path_to_run is: {'/home/swx/lk/=': None}
INFO:tensorflow:Event Multiplexer initializing.
INFO:tensorflow:Event Multiplexer done initializing
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard reload process beginning
INFO:tensorflow:Starting AddRunsFromDirectory: /home/swx/lk/=
INFO:tensorflow:Done with AddRunsFromDirectory: /home/swx/lk/=
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard reload process: Reload the whole Multiplexer
INFO:tensorflow:Beginning EventMultiplexer.Reload()
INFO:tensorflow:Finished with EventMultiplexer.Reload()
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard done reloading. Load took 0.002 secs
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is tag: b'41'
can any one offer some help?
