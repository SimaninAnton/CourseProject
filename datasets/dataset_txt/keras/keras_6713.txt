May be I am missing something, but this piece of code in models.py L648-650 looks odd to me.
if validation_data:
            sample_weight = [standardize_weights(validation_data[name]) for name in self.output_order]
            val_ins = [validation_data[name] for name in self.input_order] + [standardize_y(validation_data[name]) for name in self.output_order] + sample_weight
Why sample_weight and y are reading from the same field of validation data
validation_data[name] for name in self.output_order
