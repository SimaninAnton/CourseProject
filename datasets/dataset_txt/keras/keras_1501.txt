I'm using merge layer to solve some problem.
But after merge layer, it seems to be merged only two tensors each.
Am I right?
Actually, I want to merge whole input tensors.
For example, build a model like
AA = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
BB = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
merged = merge([AA, BB], mode='mul')
I got merge layer,
input: (None, 32, 64, 64), (None, 32, 64, 64)
output: (None, 32, 64, 64)
What I want is
output: (None, 1, 64, 64)
Could you give me some advice? Thanks in advance!
