Hi All,
I was wondering if you can merge two layers, each of which has a different python generator as input.
I have checked the example on Keras documentation, but the inputs two both layers are ready made data.
If I have two generators, I guess I need to use the fit.generator method to train the model, so shall I use something like the following?
model.fit_generator([generator1, generator2], samples_per_epoch, nb_epoch)
Shall I put two generators as a list or dictionary?
Thank you very much for your help.
Cheers,
Shuokai
