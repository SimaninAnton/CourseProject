Hi everyone, I just cloned the repo and run the py.test and I got the following result.
../../../../anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/theano/gof/op.py:633: ValueError
======================================== 5 failed, 252 passed in 2327.59 seconds =========================================
My OS is Ubuntu 16.04 and my python version is 2.7.13 installed via anaconda. Also Theano 0.8.2, tensorflow 0.12.1 and Keras 1.2.0.
The failed tests are the following:
gw1] FAILED tests/keras/backend/test_backends.py::TestBackend::test_nn_operations 
[gw0] FAILED tests/keras/backend/test_backends.py::TestBackend::test_function 
[gw1] FAILED tests/keras/backend/test_backends.py::TestBackend::test_random_normal 
[gw1] FAILED tests/keras/backend/test_backends.py::TestBackend::test_random_uniform 
[gw1] FAILED tests/keras/backend/test_backends.py::TestBackend::test_random_binomial 
Is that normal? Also I have tensorflow as my main backend.
I'm trying to do a pull request to add another model u-net in the applications but I can't proceed since I want to also run the tests after the addition of the new model.
