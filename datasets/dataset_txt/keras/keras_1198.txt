The callbacks EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau both have a patience parameter which one would expect - also according to the documentation - to have a similar effect.
However, with the current implementation, a value of patience=2 for EarlyStopping will cause the training to stop when the monitored metric has not improved for the second epoch, while patience=2 for ReduceLROnPlateau will reduce the learning rate after the third epoch without improvement.
I think the reason is that the internal counter self.wait is incremented before the check against patience in EarlyStopping , but after the check in ReduceLROnPlateau .
This behaviour should be consistent across the different callbacks.
