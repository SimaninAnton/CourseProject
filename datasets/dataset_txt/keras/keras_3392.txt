I want to implement paper:CNN-RNN: A Unified Framework for Multi-label Image Classification https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04573v1.pdf.
The net work structure can simple understand by below figture

My code can be see below

So, the problem coming to me is that how to decoder sequence embed label to label index.
By the way , anyone knows better way to implement the net work.
