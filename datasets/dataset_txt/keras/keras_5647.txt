Hi, I'm new to neural Keras, and I'm confused about the number of layers in my model.I want to have a model of three layers.
First layer: 4 neurons
Second layer:5 neurons
Third layer: 3 neurons
My code is as follows:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(5, input_dim=4))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(3))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
Am I right?
Actually, I added two dense layers in the model, but it seems that the model is a three layer neural network. I'm so confused. Can you help me?Thank you very much!
