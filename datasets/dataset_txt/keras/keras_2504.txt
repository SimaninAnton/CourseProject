I have followed the retraining on Tensorflow example for my specific classification task and have a grad-CAM visualization written code in Keras. For instance
Usually, I do load pre-train weights such as vgg16 or inception-v3 in .h5 format and works very well on my grad-CAM work. The problem is the retrained_graph.pb from retraining process by Tensorflow and I have no idea if there are any workaround like
mapping .pb file to .h5?
or do Keras have any interface to load .pb file in the same manner with loading .h5 file?
Note: I use Tensorflow as the backend
Please advise
