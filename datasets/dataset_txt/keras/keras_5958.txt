Normal strings in a model config becomes unicode string after using model_from_json():
json_string = model.to_json()
model2 = model_from_json(json_string)
print model2.layers[0].border_mode, model.layers[0].border_mode
output: (u'valid', 'valid')
I think we should fix model_from_json() function in Keras, otherwise it will cause problem like the one we have in PR #1623 right now.
However, I didn't see any problem with model_from_yaml().
