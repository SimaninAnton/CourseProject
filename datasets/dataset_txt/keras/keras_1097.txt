Hi!
I have and LSTM sequence tagger in Keras which I use for highly unbalanced data. Therefore, I'd like to use the (multiclass) F1-score as the model's main metric.
Here's the question on Stackoverflow with my version of implementation. I'd like to confirm whether it seems believable.
And I'm not sure whether there's a possibility to have the output of the model masked as well.
Because if we don't care about the model's output for the 'pad' input positions (they don't contribute to the loss anyway), there may as well be some random garbage in the output which will affect the F1 metric. It would be ideal to only have there zeros as well.
