Hi. I have 10 different data set, and I hope to train 10 models with different data set respectively.
Those model have the same layers, and my codes are as follows:
model_sequence = Sequential()
model_sequence.add(Masking(mask_value=2, input_shape=(input_length, input_dim)))
model_sequence.add(LSTM(150))
model_sequence.add(Dense(20))
My GPU is GTX TITAN X.I wonder can I train the 10 models at the same time using GPU? If I can, how should I write the codes?
Thank you very much for your assistance!
