If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
[] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I have a model made up of primarily of residual blocks which is described here on page 1.
There are around 50 odd layers in the network and it's taking around 5.5 sec for model.predict() to produce an output on a GTX Titan X.
Is this time normal for a model that deep? A 50 layer Resnet model takes 403 ms for one forward and backward pass according to this blog. Isn't model.predict() just a forward pass through the network and hence shouldn't it take less than a second to produce the output?
Thanks for the help in advance!
