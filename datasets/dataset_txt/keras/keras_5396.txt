I used to use
"get_feature = theano.function([model_best.layers[0].input],model_best.layers[17].get_output(train=False),allow_input_downcast=False) "
to get the output of a layer of a cnn model. But in the newest version of keras, it doesn't have the function "get_output()". How can I get the output of a layer of cnn model in the newest version?
I'm very grateful if you can give some advice.
