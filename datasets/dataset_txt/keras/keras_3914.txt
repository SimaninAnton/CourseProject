I'm using train_on_batch for training, which returns the loss on the given batch. How do I also get the output classification on that batch ? (I'd like to do some visualisations on the output)
To do that I currently do another call to predict to get the model output, but that's redundant since train_on_batch have already passed the input batch "forward".
Hopefully the solution would also work with test_on_batch.
