Hello,
I am coming back to you for help. I am installing a DevBox under Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS with 4 RTX 2080Ti Nvidia cards.
I have performed multiple Linux/Drivers installation without success. There is no GPU use by Keras and fore sure no multi_GPU_model calculation.
At this time, the Nvidia drivers are 410.78 with CUDA 10.0.
The Nvidia-smi function shows me the good data : all the 4 GPUs, Drivers version, Cuda Revision
I am using Anaconda Python 3.6.5.
TensorFlow : 1.12.0 with GPU version
Keras : TensorFlow Backend 2.2.4
Additionally, is there anybody who has experienced starting issue with Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS and Nvidia driver such as no starting ?
Thank you for your help
Best Regards
Edouard
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
