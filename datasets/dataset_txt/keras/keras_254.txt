In tensorflow, we can do
def conv_cond_concat(x, y):
"""Concatenate conditioning vector on feature map axis."""
x_shapes = x.get_shape()
y_shapes = y.get_shape()
return concat([
x, y*tf.ones([x_shapes[0], x_shapes[1], x_shapes[2], y_shapes[3]])], 3)
In keras functional api, I don't know how to do this with two input layers that have different sizes. Anyone knows how to achieve this in keras 2.0.5?
