I'm using flow_from_directory to get the training set from a folder with the following structure:
train
  class1
  class2
  class3
  ...
The generator is called as it follows:
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory( 
        train_data_dir,                              
        target_size=(img_height, img_width),         
        batch_size=32,                               
        class_mode='categorical')                    
I am not setting the argument classes, but I was expecting to get the labels in alphabetical order.
classes: optional list of class subdirectories (e.g. ['dogs', 'cats']). Default: None. If not provided, the list of classes will be automatically inferred (and the order of the classes, which will map to the label indices, will be alphanumeric).
However, when I classify the training images (for checking which labels are being returned), I'm don't get any specific ordering. The training goes well (accuracy of ~85%), and there is a consistency with the output labels when classifying images from the same class.
How can I infer the labels numbers generated by flow_from_directory and map them to the classes?
