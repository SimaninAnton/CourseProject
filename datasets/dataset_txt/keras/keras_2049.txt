Hello,
I am trying to build a neural network with keras which is supposed to separate a signal from a noise event. My problem is that my noise events are composed out of different classes of events and this classes are themself imbalanced. I know about the class_weight dict but as i am not interested in separating out the different classes of noise, I am using only the class S and N at the moment.
Is there a way to either tell keras that some events in the noise have a higher weight? Or should I use a multi class identifier?
Thanks in advance,
Frederik
