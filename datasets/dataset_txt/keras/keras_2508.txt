I'm working on a classifier. Currently my data structure looks like this:
data/
        dogs/
            dog001.jpg
            dog002.jpg
            ...
        cats/
            cat001.jpg
            cat002.jpg
I want to use flow_from_directory to do the training and validation.. But it is a bit clumsy to move the files into a different directory each time. Is there any option that can help that?
