I am trying to create a custom metric in keras of form custom_metric(y_true,y_pred). Most of the examples they use import keras.backend as K and then all the calculation is done using methods inside K.
Is it not possible to use just numpy library inside custom_metric function to do all the calculation and come up with one scalar output?
