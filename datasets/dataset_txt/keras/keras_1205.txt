Hi, I'm training a model using fit_generator on GPU with a keras.utils.Sequence object as the data generator but whatever the number of workers I use, Sequence won't use more than one core (over 20).
Here is my call :
history = self.model.fit_generator(self.generator,
                                   epochs=self.epochs,
                                   validation_data=(X_val, Y_val),
                                   callbacks=callback_list,
                                   workers=4,
                                   steps_per_epoch=len(self.generator),
                                   max_queue_size=8,
                                   use_multiprocessing=True).history 
Do you have any idea of a reason why?
Any help appreciated.
