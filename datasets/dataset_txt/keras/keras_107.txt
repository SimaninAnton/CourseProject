AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'get_default_graph'
I am working through an example of building a simple CNN with tensorflow/keras to classify dogs/cat pictures. I keep getting the above traceback message when executing following line of code (the first layer of my network):
Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224,224,3))
Writing tensorflow.keras instead of keras doesn't make a difference, neither does importing any of the other modules etc as suggested in previous threads for similar issues.
I'm running this all on my macbook on IDLE (for various reasons) - could this problem have something to do with the version of tensorflow I have installed? i.e not tensorflow-GPU==2.0.0-beta1
