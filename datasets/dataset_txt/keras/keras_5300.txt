I am using functional API (which is great!), when applying one layer multiple times with different input nodes, the activity regularization would not work. Giving following errors:
Exception: Layer xx has multiple inbound nodes, hence the notion of "layer output" is ill-defined. Use get_output_at(node_index) instead.
Here's my solution:
instead of using output = self.layer.output, we can do
for i in range(len(self.layer.inbound_nodes)):
            output = self.layer.get_output_at(i)
and add original regularization according to each of the output. I have tested it on my problem, but if you find anything.
