Hi im working on seq2sql project and I successfully build a model but when training I get the following error also I'm not using any Keras embedding layer. the bellow is my code.
code
the shapes of the Equestion, Col_Embeddings, and y_train is (10, 12, 3, 100) ,(10, 13, 100) and (10, 12).i searched about this error but all that cases they have used an embedding layer incorrectly. But here though I'm not using any embedding layer i get this error
indices = 2 is not in [0, 1) [[{{node lambda_3/embedding_lookup_2}} = GatherV2[Taxis=DT_INT32, Tindices=DT_INT32, Tparams=DT_FLOAT, _class=["loc:@col_token_2"], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](_arg_col_token_2_0_1, lambda_3/Assign_2, lambda_3/embedding_lookup_2/axis)]]
please help
