Hi, dear all,
I am using keras to build up a end-to-end ASR system with attention model. Keras has all the functions I need for building the model. However, the problem right now I have is my data is too large to fit the memory. So I have to use data streaming. Is there any way I can stream the data and then send the partition into training as mini-batch?
Thank you very much! I am new to Keras, sorry for the rookie question.
