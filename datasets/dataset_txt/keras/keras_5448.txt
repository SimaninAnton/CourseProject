I was looking through recurrent.py as I wanted to implement a custom RNN node.
I don't understand what are B_U and B_W in the step function for LSTM. What are the these variables doing and where are they initialised?
The new state that we passing out from the step function ([h, c]) contains only 2 elements so technically states[2] and states[3] should not exist.
Also why do we need to multiply the input with B_W here
Any clarification would be immensely helpful.
