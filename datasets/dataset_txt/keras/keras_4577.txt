I trained the model but I encountered a problem in line 65 because some values underflow in the log. Note that after the problem is encountered, I only obtain nonsensical text (more like a collection of vowels).
Such a problem is solved if the values are clipped, as in
preds = np.log(preds.clip(min=minval)) / temperature
Does anybody else have this problem? I can open a PR
