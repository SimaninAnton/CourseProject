I am currently trying to run an LSTM on multi classes. The input is in the form:
x_train = [[1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]]
y_train = [[[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]],[[3],[4],[5],[6],[4]]] #keras require a 3d matrix
However, I am getting prediction of all 0s
When I'm compiling, I'm using:
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', class_mode="categorical")
Can anybody point out how I should train such LSTM?
PS. The idea is to train an LSTM to do POS Tagging on Penn Tree bank where each array in x_train is a sentence and each integer represent a word and each integer in y_train is a tag.
