Hi. I use a RNN to classify datas.My code is as follows:
timesteps = 50
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(timesteps, 3)))
model.add(Dropout(dropout))
model.add(Dense(3))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
The sequence input_shape is (50,3), and I give each sequence a label.Actually, each (50,1)
vector is a time sequence and they represents different aspects of my (50,3) sequence.
Should I normalize all the 150 data to mean 0 and variance 1?
Or should I normalize each (50,1) vector, or (1,3) vector?
I think I should normalize each(1,3) data, but this will have a influence on each (50,1) time sequence.
Can you help me?Thank you!
