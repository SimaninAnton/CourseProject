Hi,
I've just upgraded Keras/Theano to the last cutting edge versions.
Unfortunately, I cannot load my models anymore, I get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "Convolutional4.py", line 488, in
model = LoadModel("./Results/Model_4x1_Architecture.json", "./Results/Model_4x1_Weights.h5")
File "Convolutional4.py", line 209, in LoadModel
model = model_from_json(open(ModelArchitecturePath).read())
File "/eppec/storage/sw/conda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/models.py", line 30, in model_from_json
return layer_from_config(config, custom_objects=custom_objects)
File "/eppec/storage/sw/conda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/layer_utils.py", line 24, in layer_from_config
class_name = config['class_name']
KeyError: 'class_name'
And here is the little:
def LoadModel(ModelArchitecturePath, ModelWeightsPath):
model = model_from_json(open(ModelArchitecturePath).read())
model.load_weights(ModelWeightsPath)
return model
This code was perfectly working before, but since the last upgrade, it does not anymore.
My last upgrade was 5 weeks ago, so not such a long time.
