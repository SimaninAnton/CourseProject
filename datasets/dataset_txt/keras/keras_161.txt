For the two input layers in the figure, I want to customize a layer to run specific element-wise operation for them. Define the dim for x is (None, 2, 2) and y is (None, 2). None represents the values of batch size. For every batch's element, the dim is (2, 2) and (2). How to customize a layer to calculate the value of x[0, 0] / (x[0, 1] + y[0]) + x[1, 1] / (x[1, 0] + y[1]), where x means the (2, 2) array and y means the (2) vector? Finally, the output is only one value, etc. (None, 1).
