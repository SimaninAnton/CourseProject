Hi guys,
I am wondering if any of you have implemented the SSIM (structural similarity index) to be used as objective. It is often used for measuring the similarity between two images x and y. Its formulation is as follow:
I think this must be easy to implement using generic functions of the backends (Theano os TF), but I am not familiarized with them enough.
