I am trying to train a deep neural network for speech recognition using MFCC coefficients. I have 2000 hidden units per layer and a total of 6 layers. Even then my network does not seem to learn anything. Even though the value of loss function decreases accuracy on the training set does not seem to improve. Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance.
