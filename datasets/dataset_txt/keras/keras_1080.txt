Hello, I have tried to replace my RNN preprocessing with TimeseriesGenerator and failed. The generator seems to output data in incorrect shape for RNNs:
In[17]: ts = np.arange(10)
In[21]: g = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(data = ts, targets = ts, length = 3, batch_size = 2)
In[22]: x,y = g[0]
In[23]: x
Out[23]: 
array([[0., 1., 2.],
        [1., 2., 3.]])
So first batch will contain all time steps of the two time series samples. But as far as I know, keras batch of size 2 for RNN training should consist from a single time step for 2 samples, so the output should look like [[0], [1]], right? Or fit_generator works differently than fit?
I am using Keras 2.1.5.
