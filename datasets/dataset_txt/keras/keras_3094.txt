Hi, I create a complex model using the functional api Model by combining two sequential models. When the model is training using model.fit,
the validation accuracy on the validation dataset is m, but when I use the model.evaluate to test the accuracy of the validation dataset, it gives me another value. I am wondering which one is correct and how to test the data correctly for the complex model. Thanks.
