I am currently working on a lambda layer that takes in data formats it, and pass it through a convolutional layer.
Problem is the formatting, since keras is more suited for model definition, not much can be done regarding the tensor manipulation...
Is it possible to somehow convert a keras tensor to a tensor flow tensor, do the data manipulation, and then convert it back to a keras tensor?
In my case are the operation i would like to perform is tf.unstack and tf.stack.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
