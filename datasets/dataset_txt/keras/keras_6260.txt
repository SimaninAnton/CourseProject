I am unable to run any example that uses Convolution1D. I am pretty sure it used to work for me(because I actually wrote one of those examples). I thought it might be some memory issue, but its not. The models compile successfully and crash on training (it crashes the terminal, and no theano error message or anything).
The error can be reproduced by running imdb_cnn.py or imdb_cnn_lstm.py. To make sure that this not a memory problem, I wrote a smaller model and it too crashes the same way:
import keras
from keras.layers.core import*
from keras.activations import*
from keras.models import*
from keras.layers.convolutional import*
import numpy as np

model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution1D(nb_filter=5,filter_length=3, input_shape=(10,5)))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='sgd')

x_shape=list(model.input_shape)
x_shape[0] = 7

y_shape=list(model.output_shape)
y_shape[0] = 7

x=np.zeros(tuple(x_shape))
y=np.zeros(tuple(y_shape))

model.fit(x, y)
Output:
C:\Users\USER\Desktop>python conv_test.py
Using Theano backend.
Epoch 1/100

Is anyone else facing a similar issue?
