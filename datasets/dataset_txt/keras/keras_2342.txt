Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I was able to produce a model from training using image_ocr. I also saved the architecture into a json file which I used with the model in this predict script which passes an image in a numpy array format:
`import keras.backend as K
from keras.models import model_from_json
from skimage.io import imread
K.set_image_dim_ordering('tf')
json_file = open("image_ocr_architecture.json", "r")
loaded_model_json = json_file.read()
json_file.close()
tf_dim_model = model_from_json(loaded_model_json)
weight_fn = "weights03.h5"
tf_dim_model.load_weights(weight_fn)
im = imread("a01-000u-00.png")
tf_dim_model.predict(im)`
However, when I run this script I get this error:
ValueError: The model expects 4 arrays, but only received one array. Found: array with shape (89, 1661)
I wonder what I'm doing wrong here :O
