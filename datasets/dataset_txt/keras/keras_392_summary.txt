I have developed a sentiment analysis model with cNN ,now I want to deploy the model using flask api , please can anyone tell me how should I preprocess the text after getting it as a json object from my application ,so that I can feed it my network(my network has embedding layer as the first layer with output shape as (None, 500, 32))
