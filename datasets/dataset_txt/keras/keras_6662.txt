Hi there, I run mnist_mlp.py and get the following problem
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "mnist_mlp.py", line 24, in
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
File "//anaconda/lib/python3.4/site-packages/keras/datasets/mnist.py", line 19, in load_data
data = cPickle.load(f, encoding="bytes")
TypeError: must be a unicode character, not bytes
I am on Mac OS X Yosemite, and Python 3.4.1. The file downloaded alright. I saw there was an issue opened before, actually I've tried both versions, the old one:
import six.moves.cPickle
And the new version:
from six.moves import cPickle
Didn't make any differences. Stuck and cannot train. :(
Any idea to get around it will be greatly appreciated!
