Hi,
while trying to implement conv' autoencoder, i needed to reshape the Dense input layer of the decoder to a (filters, filter_size, filter_size) shape.
d.add(Reshape((32, 11, 11))
and got the following error:
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/theano/tensor/basic.py", line 4360, in make_node raise TypeError("Shape must be integers", shp, shp.dtype) TypeError: ('Shape must be integers', TensorConstant{[ -1. 32... 19. 19.]}, 'float64')
probably i'm doing something wrong, but what??
