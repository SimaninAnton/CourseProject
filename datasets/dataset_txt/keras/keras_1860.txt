Hi..
i wander if there is a way for ZeroPadding2D in one size of the axis only ?
i have Conv2D with padding='valid' that i want to concatenate it the deeper layer
i have mismatch size by one pixel
( from the ZeroPadding2D API its look like padding is only on both side of the image )
Thanks for the help!
