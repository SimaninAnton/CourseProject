The error:
You are attempting to share a '
'same BatchNormalization layer across '
'different data flows. '
'This is not possible. '
'You should use mode=2 in '
'BatchNormalization, which has '
'a similar behavior but is shareable '
'(see docs for a description of '
'the behavior).')
Is it because of the way Batchnorm is implemented in Keras or is there something wrong with the code. I read the doc and I think I want to use the average of the mean and std to normalize in test which is mode=0.
