confidence for decision is very good to have
for example neural network gives decision 1 for given input data sample
let say that data sample is text, then text has positive sentiment
then if confidence is available it maybe used for estimation of reliability of this decision
example 1
decision is 1 , and confidence measured by probability is 0.99
so decision is reliable
example 1
decision is 1 , and confidence measured by probability is 0.1
so decision is un reliable
