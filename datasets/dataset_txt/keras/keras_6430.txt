I'm searching for the discussion somewhere but if i remember correctly somewhere in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90-S1M7Ny_o Jeff Dean talked about the fact that TensorFlow do not support loops, they basically unfold the scan each time. I think we must do the same for our backend if we don't want fragmentation.
In theano should be possible to unfold a scan. and so in tensor flow. In my opinion we should do the same.
