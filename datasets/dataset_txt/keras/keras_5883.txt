It seems that Keras 0.3.2 is incompatible with TensorFlow 0.7.1.
I was running Keras 0.3.2 succesfully with TensorFlow 0.6.0.
After running 'pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl' to upgrade to 0.7.1, I've got the following error message:
`ImportError: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/root/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/init.py", line 35, in
from tensorflow.core.framework.graph_pb2 import *
File "/root/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/core/framework/graph_pb2.py", line 6, in
from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor
ImportError: No module named protobuf
Error importing tensorflow. Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.`
It happens in the very beginning, on the import (see gist - https://gist.github.com/lukovkin/cbc13af27fa0aa7cf7e3)
Does anybody have this issue too?
May be doesn't need to be fixed right now, but worth mentioning in the docs?
