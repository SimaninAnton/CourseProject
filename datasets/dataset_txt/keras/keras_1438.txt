Hello,
This feature might be too niche but I thought it could be useful for developers like myself who are less accustomed with multiprocessing:
When working with large objects that can not be saved to disk efficiently (in my case pandas dataframe with lists of lists inside the columns) memory usage of multiple workers that operate on this object can become prohibiting and bottleneck the training. There are ways to enable memory sharing between sub processes , however, since Sequence generator hides away multiprocessing functionality, user will have to write their own multiprocessing logic to enable shared memory.
I imagine Sequence utility could have an optional method that would accept a list of objects and will enable them as shared before initializing the pool of processes that will cut down on the RAM requirements of workers
Please let me know your thoughts and thank you for continuous support to an awesome library!
