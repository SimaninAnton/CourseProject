I tried to use AtrousConvolution2D, but its behavior is not consistent.
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import ZeroPadding2D, AtrousConvolution2D
from keras import callbacks
import numpy as np
model = Sequential()
model.add(ZeroPadding2D((1,1), input_shape=(3, 12, 12), dim_ordering='th'))
model.add(AtrousConvolution2D(3, 3, 3, atrous_rate=(2,2)))
model.summary()
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
print 'Actual Output Shape: ', model.predict(np.ones((1, 3, 12, 12))).shape
Actual Output Shape: (1, 3, 10, 10) <- as model.summary() says.
print 'Training completed successfully?:', isinstance(model.fit(np.ones((1,3,12,12)), np.ones((1,3,10,10)), nb_epoch=1, verbose=0), callbacks.History)
Training completed successfully?: True
As model.summary says that output of AtrousConvolution2D should be (1, 3, 10, 10), but actual shape is (1, 3, 12, 12)
Therefore, I cannot train the model with AtrousConvolution2D.
Can you, @patyork, help with this issue, too?
