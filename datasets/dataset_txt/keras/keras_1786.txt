When I run RandomizedGridSearchCV on a sklearn Pipeline with a KerasClassifier, I have to pass n_jobs=1 to RandomizedGridSearchCV.
If I don't, the CV jobs get assigned to the same GPU and I get CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
I am thinking about making a version of RandomizedGridSearchCV with multi-GPU support that uses the GPUs in round-robin. Is this the correct path or is there an easier way?
