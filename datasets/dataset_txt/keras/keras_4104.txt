Hi,
I have an issue with the MaxPooling2d layers in Keras using theano (and in theano itself).
I fail to run my code when I use a MaxPooling2d layer in Keras (using theano). I have my own neural network code using theano which also fails when I use the theano maxpooling:
from theano.tensor.signal import pool
pool_layer = pool.pool_2d()
Perhaps there is an issue in this new maxpooling version in theano? I believe that it was recently changed, previously being:
from theano.tensor.signal import downsample
Basically running the MNIST convolutional example fails with the maxpooling layer in Keras, but works without. You can see the simple code here:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py
I would very much appreciate any help. Since everything else is working for me, I have an idea that this is a general issue.
Thanks,
Marco
