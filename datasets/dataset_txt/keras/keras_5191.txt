I have a problem with the Scikit-learn wrapper. I have my model ready and I already tested it with some parameter, but I would like to investigate more accurately the hyper-parameter space. I already used scikit-learn's GridSearchCV in the past for some simple classifier, so I'm familiar with its simple syntax.
Unfortunately when I run GridSearchCV for my keras model I don't get any error message, but the IDLE simply ask me if I want to kill my process. If I push 'cancel' this message appears 4/5 times and at the end it stops asking, but the program never finishes to run and python simply stop to responde. I'm sure that is not because of the running time because I also tried with very limited space to explore and it does not work. I also tried to update Theano, Keras and Scikit-learn, but nothing changed. Do you have any idea of how to solve this problem?
P.S. I'm using OS X El Capitan
