Using TF backend, I want to iterate 2 Tensors at the same time.
These Tensors have the shape (?, N, M) when constructing the computation graph, with N and M being natural numbers and ? will be the batch size.
I need to iterate this 2 Tensors at the same time so that I can apply transformations to them at the same time. If it was only one, this would be easily managed with this layer Lambda(lambda x: function(x)). However, since I have 2 Tensors, this can not be done like that, Lambda(lambda x,y: function(x,y)) raises an error since you can only pass one argument to a Layer. If passing [Tensor1, Tensor2] to the Lambda layer, an error will be raised since since the y variable is not defined.
How can I solve this?
