Hello, I am training autoencoder model with real time data by calling fit method of keras model on each occurance of the sample data. To understand the scenario, please refer #4446, which says we can call fit multiple times.
Raw code for my implementation is:
for each_occurance_of_the_sample: model.fit(the_training_sample,the_training_sample)
As I am using autoencoders input and outputs are the same(mentioning to avoid confusion).
