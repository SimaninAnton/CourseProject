What is the best way to implement a model with following logic:
InputA: SHAPE (, 50, 85)
InputB: SHAPE (, 85)
I have InputA and InputB coming as output from two different models.
I want to learn a new representation of all the single instances of InputA such that output shape from new model should be (_, 85) following the below logic
New representation:= aA1 + bA2 + ... + cA50
basically, I need dot product between single instance InputB and single instance of InputA
which weights (a, b, .., c) in the above equation.
Any help how to best implement this model in keras will be highly appreciated.
