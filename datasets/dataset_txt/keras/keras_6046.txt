I am solving a regression problem using neural network, I wrote a generator to generate batch data and use
model.fit_generator(generate_batch_data(vocPath,imageNameFile,100),nb_epoch=10,show_accuracy=True)
to train the model. In my generate_batch_data function, x is a 4D array contains a batch of images, but y is a list, each element in the list is an custom object containing the ground truth value for my problem, I want to use this list to calculate loss in my custom loss function.
How can I implemented a custom loss function then? Can I assume that the parameter y_pred in custom_objective(y_true, y_pred) is just the list generated by my generate_batch_data function and I can treat it as a normal list? Thx!
