Hi
Suppose we have this structure:
model = load_model(model_path, custom_objects={'AnchorBoxes': AnchorBoxes,
                                               'L2Normalization': L2Normalization,
                                               'DecodeDetections': DecodeDetections})
The name of keys of custom_objects are arbitrary or they are the name of custom_objects are defined before in the model structure?
