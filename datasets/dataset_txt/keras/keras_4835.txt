Hi,
there is a small issue in the example of LSTM layer - https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py
If user uses list instead numpy array to store X data, the program will trigger the exception in 620th line of models.py.
Hope this problem could be solved in order to reduce confusion.
Thanks,
Shun
