Hi and thanks in advance,
I am using theano GPU as backend and here is my code:
import os
os.environ['KERAS_BACKEND'] = 'theano'
from keras.layers import Deconvolution2D
from keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np
model = Sequential()
model.add(Deconvolution2D(3, 3, 3, output_shape=(None, 3, 14, 14), border_mode='valid', input_shape=(3, 12, 12)))
dummy_input = np.ones((32, 3, 12, 12))
preds = model.predict(dummy_input)
print(preds.shape)
I got an output with shape (32, 5, 14, 3) which I cannot make sense of. Also, it is different from the documentation https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#deconvolution2d
I am confused.
