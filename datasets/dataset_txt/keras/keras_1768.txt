I want to stack a conv layer on top of lstm layer and I get the following error "Layer convolution1d_1 does not support masking", I'm not using the most updated version of keras(I know I know its in the posting rules) because I don't want to update all my code until I will be sure that by doing so I will solve my problem.
In #411 @fchollet wrote that "This will be resolved by the upcoming TimeDistributed layer; closing." and I would like to know if this actually happend (this post is from 2015)
If it didn't, how can I overcome this error?
Thanks in advenced :)
