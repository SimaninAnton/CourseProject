I have an image of unknown dimension (None, None, None, 3) and a small 1d vector of size 5, and I'd like to concatenate this vector to the channels of every pixel in the image, thus creating an "image" of size (None, None, None, 8).
How can I do this concatenation, and is it best to do with tensors or should I do it with layers?
I've been looking at K.tile but the documentation is a bit weak for that function.
In other words, I’ve got a 1d tensor of length w I would like to concatenate to every pixel in an image, which would make an nxmx3 image become nxmx(3+w) image.
