It seems that Keras lacks documentation regarding functional API but I might be getting it all wrong.
I have multiple independent inputs and I want to predict an output for each input. Here's my code so far:
 hour = Input(shape=(1,1), name='hour')
 hour_output = LSTM(1, name='hour_output')(hour)

 port = Input(shape=(1,1), name='port')
 port_output = LSTM(1, name='port_output')(port)

 model = Model(inputs=[hour, port], outputs = [hour_output, port_output])

 model.compile(loss="mean_squared_error", optimizer="adam", metrics=['accuracy'])
 model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=10 batch_size=1, verbose=2, shuffle=False)
Error I get for this:
ValueError: No data provided for "hour_output". Need data for each key in: ['hour_output', 'port_output']
I also had a hard time getting the right input for this, so I ended up using dictionary with example structure:{'hour': array([[[0]], [[1]], [[3]]]) }. I don't like that (using dict) either.
Note that I have more inputs to use and for this to make sense, but now I am just trying to make the model work.
