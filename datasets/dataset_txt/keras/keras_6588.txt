Dear fchollet:
Here is the issue:
I just change the Keras from anaconda's version to the version on Github.
when I try to build a DNN:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(x.shape[1], hiddenLayers[0],init='glorot_uniform')) 
model.add(PReLU((hiddenLayers[0])))
model.add(BatchNormalization((hiddenLayers[0])))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
It meets the error saying that:
model.add(PReLU((hiddenLayers[0])))
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.10-x86_64/egg/keras/layers/advanced_activations.py", line 33, in init
AttributeError: can't set attribute
Any idea what it is reason?
Cheers,
