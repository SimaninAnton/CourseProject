I'm using the builtin image preprocessing to produce a stream of batches.
In the directory, there is one subfolder (=class) with a total of 8 pictures.
If I specify a batch_size >= 8, every batch has the same size.
But if the batch_size is <8, then the batch_sizes will be:
batch_size
8%batch_size
batch_size
8%batch_size
...
so for example: 6, 2, 6, 2, 6
This seems like a bug to me.
It might make sense, if Keras is internally keeping track of the images it has already visited.
But even then, this behaviour should be documented.
