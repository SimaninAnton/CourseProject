Using TF backend, I need to construct a similarity matrix of two 2D vectors, both with shape (N, M), being N and M natural numbers.
The function tf.losses.cosine_distance is only between 1D tensors. I need to build a Tensor matrix NxM such that matrix[i][j] will be the cosine similarity of the Tensor1[i] and Tensor2[j].
How can I do this?
