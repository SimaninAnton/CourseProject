on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
installed keras from scratch as below :
installed Cuda Toolkit 7.5
installed cuDNN v4
installed python-pip, python-dev using apt-get
installed tensorflow 0.9.0 (later upgraded to 0.9.0rc)
installed keras by downloading from here https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git
and extract, and typing command line : sudo pip install keras
however, it didn't work properly, I remembered it was a scipy problem so I installed scipy and
again tried to install keras by the same command : sudo pip install keras
but I only got these messages :
Requirement already up-to-date: keras in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Requirement already up-to-date: theano in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from keras)
Requirement already up-to-date: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from keras)
Requirement already up-to-date: six in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from keras)
Requirement already up-to-date: numpy>=1.7.1 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from theano->keras)
Requirement already up-to-date: scipy>=0.11 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from theano->keras)
Cleaning up...
and on the terminal by typing "python" I tried to import Sequential from keras.models only to check if keras was installed properly but got theses errors :
File "", line 1, in
File "keras/init.py", line 4, in
from . import engine
File "keras/engine/init.py", line 3, in
from .topology import InputSpec
File "keras/engine/topology.py", line 17, in
from ..utils.io_utils import ask_to_proceed_with_overwrite
File "keras/utils/io_utils.py", line 3, in
import h5py
Originally, the error occured when importing module backend so I upgraded my tensorflow and after that the above errors occured. (I edited the home./keras/keras.json to change the backend from theano to tensorflow)
I installed anaconda just because it is equipped with many useful python packages but it didn't work for this problem.
What should I do?
