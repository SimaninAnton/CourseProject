Hello,
As the title states I am curious as to if there is a way to control the image modification seed and the shuffle seed independently. This would allow for example, two ImageDataGenerators with the same image modification parameters (rotation_range etc) to flow through the same directory in the same shuffled order, but perform the image modifications different random ways . Thank you
