I'm working on a sequence labeling task where I need to predict multiple labels for a given video. My vocabulary for the labels is 5000. I extracted 20 frames from each video and got a visual embedding by passing it through a CNN to get a 512 dimensional feature vector. So my input data is of the form
X_train = (no_videos, 20 , 512).
For the labels, I can have multiple labels to each video which is a subset of that 5000 vocabulary.
I want to train a LSTM model to predict the labels for a given video using the above dataset.
Can anyone please help how to do this ?
Thanks in advance.
