Hi there! During experiments with Keras I have faced with the following problem. When I use any type of RNN layers, method model.predict(X, batch_size=b_size) gives different answers with different b_size values. Furthermore the bigger the b_size value then better the results. It is very strange, because, obviously, if you don't use stateful RNN then output should not depend on the b_size.
I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that. Thanks for help!
