As mentioned in issue #5357 (#5357 (comment)) by @spearsem and @alexchao56 it would be nice if we could enable dropout in the prediction stage of the model and not just in training.
There is solid work motivating this use case as an approximation to Bayesian deep learning http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gal16.pdf (in this case as a variational approximation to deep GPs).
Ideally one would be able to run predict multiple times and use the expected value of these predictions as an estimate of the overall prediction and its std to quantify the uncertainty around the prediction.
Other than the feature request, is there a way to possibly go around the current setup in Keras to achieve this ?
