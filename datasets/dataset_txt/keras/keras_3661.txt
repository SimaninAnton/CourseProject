This is the error and it seems that the layer shape shown in the example is not the same as the 'vgg16_weights.h5' downloaded.
Here is the error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):

model.layers[k].set_weights(weights)
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/keras/engine/topology.py", line 889, in set_weights
'provided weight shape ' + str(w.shape))
Exception: Layer weight shape (3, 3, 128, 64) not compatible with provided weight shape (64, 3, 3, 3)
