Hi,
I am trying to do some computation between the layers while model is being created ( via build graph ). Is it possible that I can know the number of the layer being processed during this time?
For eg. if there are 6 layers
model = Sequential()
model.add(ZeroPadding2D((1,1),input_shape=(3,224,224)))
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, activation='relu'))
model.add(ZeroPadding2D((1,1)))
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2), strides=(2,2)))
Is is possible to know that Convolution2D is at 3th and 5th place. I can't use the output function( used to get the output using layer list) because this needs to be used during the graph building.
