For example model.save_weights('model_weight.hdf5') will put the file in the same directory as my python file. But
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="weights.hdf5", verbose=1, save_best_only=True)
model.fit(X, y, batch_size=128, nb_epoch=120, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1)
and weights.hdf5 is no where to be found. I've imported ModelCheckpoint.
