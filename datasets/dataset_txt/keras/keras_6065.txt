In compile() function of class Sequential, the self.y is declared as
self.y = T.zeros_like(self.y_train)
self.y should be the groudtruth input during training. The weird problem I encountered (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34983983/the-right-way-to-define-a-function-in-theano) makes me suspect if this is the right way to declare an input of theano function.
So is there anyone can shed explanation about this?
