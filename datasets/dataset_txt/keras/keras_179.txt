Describe the current behavior
Hi !
I'm having a strange behavior during fine-tuning.
I'm trying to fine-tune Inception on two classes : dogs and cats, with the example from the documentation. But when I launch the learning, the accuracy stays around 0.5 and the loss is around 7 (that's a bit huge isn't it ?).
It seems that there's nothing wrong with the code, so what's happening there ?
I've tried the same code and dataset on another computer and models but the behavior is still the same !
Describe the expected behavior
The model accuracy tends to 1 and the loss to 0.
