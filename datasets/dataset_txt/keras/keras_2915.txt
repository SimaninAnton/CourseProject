Hi,
I work with Conditional GANs and in the last days I'm working with Conditional Wasserstein GAN keras implementation, starting from this code:
https://github.com/tdeboissiere/DeepLearningImplementations/tree/master/WassersteinGAN
the problem is that Conditional WGAN (and GANs and Conditional GANs too) don't produce correct output when batchnorm is not set on batchnorm_mode=2
I tried mode=0 before keras 2.0 and the generated images by the generator become indipendent by the noise, so I do not get any variability.
So, in keras 2.0 I cannot work with WGAN/GAN anymore, being mode=2 removed by new batchnorm implementation.
I think this is a very big issue and I hope the old batchnorm modes will be supported again, otherwise keras would not work on most of recent generative models.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
