I am building a two-stream model and use pretrained ResNet-50 twice. But the error came out:
RuntimeError: The name 'resnet50' is used 2 times in the model. All layer names should be unique.
If there is some one knows how can I change the names of my two ResNet50 model?
(My code like this : x=ResNet50(weights='imagenet')(x)
y=ResNet50(weights='imagenet')(y)
)
