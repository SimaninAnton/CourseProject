Hey guys,
Has anyone managed to derive the math in these recent active attention stuff?

I'm having trouble understanding the concept of how they derive the errors through their new 'layer' and see whether it can actually be implemented in keras.
I think at least the last one a softmax layer and a multiplicative "merge" mode is enough. The first one is rather iffy.
