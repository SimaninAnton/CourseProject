I am trying to implement a full image test because according to literature eg https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1700v1.pdf it is more efficient. Suppose I have two max-pooling layers of stride 2, it means that I have to shift the input in each layer 4 times,. How can one merge the resulting feature maps in each layer before using it as an input to the next convolution layer?
Any advice on how to best approach this?
