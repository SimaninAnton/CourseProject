Hi,
I was testing the graph models and could not get to run the "mnist_siamese_graph.py" file in the examples folder. I did not get the same error when I used Keras 0.3.2.
Using Theano backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "../mnist_siamese_graph.py", line 111, in
g.compile(loss={'output': contrastive_loss}, optimizer=rms)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/models.py", line 1265, in compile
if self.outputs[self.output_order[0]].output_shape[-1] == 1:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getitem'
