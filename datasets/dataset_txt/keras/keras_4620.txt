Hi, all.
I have customized my own generator to read image data batch by batch. In the training process, I used model checkpoints to save the best model as hdf5 file. However, I consistently run into the following issue. I confirm that I have installed up-to-date Keras from source and I am root.
Could any one share suggestions to fix this? Thank you.
