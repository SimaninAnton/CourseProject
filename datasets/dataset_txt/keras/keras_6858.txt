Hi, I have a question about training a LSTM with multiple time series. Could you tell me how does the BPTT work at this case? Suppose these sequences are related to each other, so I can't train each sequence separately. Also, there is no obvious order of these sequences so you can't train them using a multi-dimensional LSTM, as discussed in Alex Graves' paper.
