Hello,
I'm a new about python and Keras, I wanna make some test about OCR without segmention using LSTM. I didn't find related example in the code. I noticed MNIST demo, but it's a single char not string sequence. Would you like to make a little demo about OCR using LSTM similar to ocropy [https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy],
THX.
