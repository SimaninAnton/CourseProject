Hello,
I am trying to build a very large neural network, this neural network would be too computationally intensive for my computer, so I would like to optimize my neural network so that each neuron is not connected to every other neuron in the next layer, but connected to the 100 neurons next to it on the next layer. How would I do this? Thank you!
