Hi,
I am new in python and theano, and I have a big question about Keras.
Is it possible to implement MLP mixture of expert methodology in Keras?
Could you please guide me by a simple code in Keras for a binary problem with 2 experts.
It needs to define a cost function like this:
g = Gate.layers[-1].output
o1 = MLP1.layers[-1].output
o2 = MLP2.layers[-1].output
def ME_objective(y_true, y_pred):
A = g[0] * T.exp(-0.5 * T.sqr(y_true – o1))
B = g[1] * T.exp(-0.5 * T.sqr(y_true – o2))
cost = -T.log((A+B).sum())
return cost
Thank you.
