When the generator returns a numpy array and not a list, the fit_generator function uses the wrong axis to determine the batch_size. This results in a wrong counting of the samples seen.
For example, if the generator returns numpy arrays with shape (128, 40, ..), then the number seen will be increased in 40 steps instead of 128. This can cause an Exception if the sampes_per_epoche is not dividable by 40. This bug is fixed in pull request #1407.
