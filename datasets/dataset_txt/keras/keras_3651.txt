Hello,
thanks for creating the great Keras!!
I have one issue:
I create weights with np.zeros
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((max_features , embedding_dims))
Then I use
e = Embedding(
                  max_features,
                  embedding_dims,
                  input_length=maxlen,
                  weights=[embedding_matrix],
                  trainable=False,
                  )
And I get the error:
ValueError: You called set_weights(weights) on layer "embedding_1" with a weight list of length 1, but the layer was expecting 0 weights. Provided weights: [array([[-0.01543641, 0.00745765, 0.0926055 , .....
If I create the Embedding without setting the weights and query the weights with w = e.get_weights(), w is an empty list. What am I doing wrong?
Thanks a lot,
Ernst
