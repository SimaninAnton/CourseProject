This is more of a conceptual clarification.
I have the following architecture :
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(batch_size,
               batch_input_shape=(batch_size, tsteps, 1)))  
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop',metrics=["accuracy"])
The LSTM is able to make pretty accurate predictions as of now.
Training data :
Note that the training data for each of the 3 weeks is almost similar in shape.
LSTM predictions on unseen testing data :
As you can see, the LSTM is still able to trace the unexpected peak in the graph which was never seen in the training data.
Any reason as to how the LSTM is able to do the above?
