As far as I know, LCN (local contrast normalization) is one of essential parts in systems that employ convolutional networks. I was wondering and have searched if it is implemented in Keras or if how I could implement it, but couldn't find any except one issue, #521, that Keras doesn't do it by default.
How do people do it then? This issue might be more suitable on google groups, but looks like here is more active. Also I'd like to know if it would be implemented in the future.
Thanks.
