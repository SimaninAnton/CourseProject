I am new to Keras so maybe I just don't know it better yet but there are a few things I noticed.
For example train_on_batch() changes its return type from a scalar to a list depending on whether the network has just one or many outputs. If I wanted to create something more generic that handles both cases, I am forced to perform type-checking operation on my end. This is why I wanted to ask whether it was possible to change thing like this and simply always return a list.
Something similar, but way worse, happens when one changes the model inputs from single, to multi channel. I noticed that I have to change because in a single-input network I might hand in a [batch_size, nb_samples, nb_dimensions] matrix whereas this changes to a list for each input where each list has to contain the data for each channel etc. Imho it would be easier to simply always demand a list because that way you do not run into the issue where you have to re-write your batch generation logic.
This is not a complaint. I love Keras and I think it's awesome and please forgive me if I am wrong with what I suggest here but if not it would be great to keep such things in mind.
And since I am on it .. I noticed that a lot of questions are getting asked here on github. A lot of questions that would also fit to stackoverflow. I am not sure why but wouldn't it be better to enforce this as some point by close all new issues and ask the people to move their general questions to stackoverflow? I am not affiliated with so but it's simply much easier to get an overview of existing questions over there.
What do you guys think?
