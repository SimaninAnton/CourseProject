The predict_on_batch method appers to be broken in 1.0.X (tested with head revision as well).
If I load a graph defined model (a multi-layered LSTM) and attempt
preds_batch = model.predict_on_batch({'input' : X_batch, 'output': y_batch})
I get an output like {u'output': array([ 0.97785485], dtype=float32)} , even though the batch has 128 items in it.
The predict method appears to have the same issue.
