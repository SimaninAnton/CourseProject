In Reuters dataset, there are 11228 instances while in the dataset's webpage there are 21578. Even in the reference paper there are more than 11228 examples after pruning.
Unfortunately, there is no information about the Reuters dataset in Keras documentation. Is it possible to clarify how this dataset gathered and what the topics labels are? It mentioned there are 46 topics but what is the category e.g. for topic number 32?
