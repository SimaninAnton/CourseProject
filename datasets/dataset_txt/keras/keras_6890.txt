Hello!
I was looking my network weights, when I realize that all my bias values on a Dense layer were 0s. I saw on the Dense Layer initialization: self.b = shared_zeros((self.output_dim)). Shouldn't be self.b = shared_ones((self.output_dim))?
I don't know if I didn't understand, or if it exists somewhere inside the code that changes it. I'm kinda new on Theano stuff.
