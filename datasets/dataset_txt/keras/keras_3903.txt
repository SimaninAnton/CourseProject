I would like to experiment with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) as in arXiv:1606.00915. The Idea is basically that you use the same filter kernels at different atrous rates to extract features at multiple scales.
I know I can create shared Layers using something like
aconv = AtrousConvolution2D(64, 3, 3, atrous_rate=(6,6), border_mode='same')
shared_1 = aconv(input)
shared_2 = aconv(input)
But I would need to change the atrous_rate parameter of one layer afterwards. Maybe something like the following?
aconv = AtrousConvolution2D(64, 3, 3, atrous_rate=(6,6), border_mode='same')
shared_1 = aconv(input)
shared_2 = aconv(input, atrous_rate=(12,12))
Or is it possible to create two different layers and have them share their weights?, something like:
aconv_1 = AtrousConvolution2D(64, 3, 3, atrous_rate=(6,6), border_mode='same')
aconv_2 = AtrousConvolution2D(64, 3, 3, atrous_rate=(12,12), border_mode='same')
aconv_1.shareWeights(aconv_2)
shared_1 = aconv_1(input)
shared_2 = aconv_2(input)
