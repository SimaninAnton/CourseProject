In most simple classification problems, we have two classes: class-0 and class-1.
In my case I only have the data for Class 0 and none for class 1. I am thinking of making a model based on "One class classification" approach [http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/76420/classifier-for-only-one-class]
Does current Keras support "One class classification" approach ? If not, any plans of putting it in your roadmap ?
