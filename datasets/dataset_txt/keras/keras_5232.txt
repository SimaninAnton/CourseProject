Hi all,
I am trying to do multi-task learning, like a single network, multiple loss functions. I show a simple graph below, hope you will get it.
                                  | --->   layer3_1 ---> loss
layer1 ---> layer2 --->   
                                  | --->   layer3_2 ---> loss
I already read through issue 224 here, but i can't find the fork function or layer, or split function. Could anybody show me how to do this? Thank you
