Currently, the ImageDataGenerator.fit() and ImageDataGenerator.flow() implementations require assert that the number of channels is either 1 or 3. Some datasets use images with a different number of channels while not being video. For example RGBD, RGB+NIR imagery (common in satellite imagery) or even 8 band multispectral imagery. A current example is Spacenet challenge dataset.
This was tested with the current theano and keras, current exception is at the implementation line 439.
