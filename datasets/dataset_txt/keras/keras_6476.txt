Hello,
I'm having issues with padding empty sequences.
Those might happen when dealing with sentences containing only out-of-dictionary words, such as Tweets.
Here's a very small use case: http://www.neuralnoise.com/keras_tokenizer_py3.html
Here's a stripped-to-the-core code sample: http://www.neuralnoise.com/pad_empty_sequences.html
Is this a known issue?
All the best
