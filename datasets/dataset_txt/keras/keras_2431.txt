I encountered an error when try to input the initial_state to the ConvLSTM2D layer.
lstm_input = Input(shape=(None,) + (32, 32, 3)) 
initial_state_input = Input(shape=(32, 32, 3)) 
x = ConvLSTM2D(128, (3,3), initial_state=initial_state_input, name='lstm')(lstm_input)
It gives me an error message: TypeError: ('Keyword argument not understood:', 'initial_state')
Probably "initial_state" has not been implemented for ConvLSTM2D layer? If so, what else method I could use to set the hidden state of the ConvLSTM2D layer? #6142
Thanks!
