Dear all,
Keras is new to me! I just play with provided example script: mnist_mlp.py (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py)
The accuracy is very good, but I found a interesting thing: although val_acc is improving, val_loss don't converge, more badly, after 20 epoch, the val_loss is larger than val_loss at first epoch. I have attached my training log, please check! Could you tell me the reason why this happen?
Thanks in advance!
