I try to produce some solution to Kaggle's Galaxy Zoo Competiton with Keras. This is essentially a classic image classification task where "labels" are class probability vectors.
The data being far to large to read into the memory en bloc, I try to apply Keras's data generators (actually, at the first step I don't want to apply any augmentation so most services of ImageDataGenerator are unused at the moment).
My problem is, that if I understand correctly, flow_from_directory requires that all the training images must be sorted in distinct subfolders according to the classes (and so no explicit training labels vector/matrix required). But this fits only to classification; how could one separate training files when the training labels are probability vectors with possibly equal values so no clear winning class? And anyway, in general, how could one provide "labels" in case of entire matrices as desired outputs?
Isn't any way to skip the sorting to subdirectories by "class" and provide any y/Y by the traditional way as common vector and still flowing data from directory?
