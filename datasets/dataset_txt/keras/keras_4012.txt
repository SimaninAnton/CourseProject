I would like to create a custom RNN for which the initial state value can be estimated. As an initial proof of concept, I updated the build method, to create a tensor for the initial state and appended the initial_state variable to the trainable_weights.
self.trainable_weights.append(self.initial_state)
I also changed get_initial_state
def get_initial_states(self, x):
    return [self.initial_state]
Having done this, I am getting the Theano error:
ValueError: ('this shared variable already has an update expression', (rrntest_1_initial_state, DimShuffle{0,1}.0))
It appears that my na√Øve approach is not sufficient and that I will need to dig deeper into the code to produce a working solution.
I would like to understand what else need to be changed and why. Thanks.
