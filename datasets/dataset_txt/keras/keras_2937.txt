Using "ImageDataGenerator" on RGB images seems to generate images with non-RGB values. I'm having issues figuring out the mapping to throw the generated images to RGB.
Example:
an RGB image
an <? channels> image generated from ImageDataGenerator's flow()
I have tried varying the order of the channels but I cannot retrieve a normal image. Has anyone seen this before ?
Keras version: 2.0.1
