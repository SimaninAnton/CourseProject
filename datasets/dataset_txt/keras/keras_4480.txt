Hello! I want to implement the neural network model with CRF-based objective function via Keras.
So, in order to do it, the loss-function should store and update during the train a few matrixes.
How can I do this? Moreover this layer should be able in test or predict mode to give another output - a most likely sequence of tags. As I've understood - there's no way to solve this issue without changes in the core code of Keras.
Thanks for help!
