Sometimes we need to create an output of a graph that does not need a desired. For example, variational auto-encoders have a gaussian prior that needs to be optimized that are solely function of the hidden states. Sparse auto-encoders have the same property. Also, we may want to create a measurement output to visualize what is going on inside the network (like how sparse is a hidden state, what is the spectral radius of a recurrent layer, etc).
Right now, I'm solving this problem by creating an output and defining an objective function where y_true is merely a place holder. Nevertheless, I still have to pass a value for y_true at fit time and take space on the GPU.
My question is, should we write a new type of output that does not need a desired or does Keras already have a way to solve that problemï¿½?
