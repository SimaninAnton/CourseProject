In situations where Keras is not being used to create a classifier, it seems a bit confusing to me that (a) class_mode is set to 'binary' or 'categorical' and (b) model.fit(show_accuracy=True) outputs values instead an error or warning.
(I was peeking through the discussion in #108 to get some background.)
How would you feel about adding a class_mode=None option for situations where class_mode doesn't make sense, that a user could set manually in model.compile, along with an associated error for show_accuracy=True if class_mode has indeed been set to None?
Happy to submit a PR if this (or a related change) seems reasonable to you!
