Hello,
I'm trying out Keras and I liked the ImageDatagenerator idea.
However there are still some bugs as far as I can see.
One that I notices was when you save the images to a directory, the generated data gets changed.
if self.save_to_dir: for i in range(current_batch_size): img = array_to_img(batch_x[i]
array_to_img can change batch_x[i](it scales the values)
So a fix might be :
array_to_img(batch_x[i].copy())
I hope I did not overlook anything
