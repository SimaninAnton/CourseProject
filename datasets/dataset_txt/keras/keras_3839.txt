Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
optimizers.rmsprop(lr=0.001, rho=0.9, epsilon=1e-06)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')
I change the lr=0.001 to 0.1,10,etc but I got the same loss.
And I tried to change many things in my LSTM,including batch_size,nb_epoch,output_dim,optimizer...all the things I can think to change, but I just got similar loss.What can I do now?
