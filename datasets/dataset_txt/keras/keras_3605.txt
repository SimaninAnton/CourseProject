Hi everybody,
Keras doesn't have a model for multi-player games. Most people just create multiple models and alternate training batches.
I put together an adversarial model to make things easier. The model simultaneously trains each player and combines the updates into a single training function. This way you can train an adversarial model using model.fit. Should significantly reduce the amount of code needed for GANs, BiGANs, etc.

Please let me know any thoughts or comments. I'd like to eventually get an adversarial model pulled into the main line. Anyone want to help put something like this together?
AdversarialModel
AdversarialModel constructor takes a base model and a list of players. The AdversarialModel constructs a copy of the base model and targets for each player.
AdversarialModel compile takes a list of optimizers. Each player model is compiled, and the updates are combined into a single training function.
AdversarialOptimizer
AdversarialOptimizer determines how the updates are combined. I implemented simultaneous, alternating, and unrolled. This is where a lot of interesting research is taking place. I don't see a good way to implement Unrolled GANs without something like this module.
Cheers,
Ben
