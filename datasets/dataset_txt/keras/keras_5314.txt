I had a graph model that has one input, a middle feature extractor sequential model (called 'seq_model') added as a node in the graph right after the input node, and multiple output nodes after the feature extractor sequential model. This code works fine with keras version 0.3.2.
I upgraded keras to version 1.0.1 without any changes to the model as well as any training code that uses the model.
The first thing it complains were the ThresholdedLinear, ThresholdedReLU and SReLU activation are not definded. Since those were not important in my training, I just commented those out.
Then, it failed with the following exception.
Exception: Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor activation_input_1 at layer "seq_model". The following previous layers were accessed without issue: []
Since this same code works even after reverting back to 0.3.2, is graph legacy API broken? Is there any intent in supporting Graph in the future or will it be removed in future releases in favor of the new functional API?
Thanks in advance for any help on this.
