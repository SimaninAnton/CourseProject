Hello,
Is there a way to add a trainable scalar weight in order to multiply a dense matrix, preferably in a Graph? I am trying to build morphologically aware word embeddings and I need to be able to weigh differently the embeddings of the whole word and its morphemes. I am trying to build a variation of this model: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/226628/[COLING2014]%20Morphological%20Word%20Embedding.pdf
Thanks for your help!
