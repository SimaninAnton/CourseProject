Right now the backend code for creating an identity matrix creates a numpy identity matrix using np.eye, and then converts it to a tensor. However, both tensorflow and theano provide tf.eye and T.eye methods specifically for this purpose. Unlike np.eye, these allow the identity matrix to have a variable size. Could the backend code be updated to use the native functions?
