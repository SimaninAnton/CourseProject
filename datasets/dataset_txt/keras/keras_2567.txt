In the example of variational auto-encoder in keras, the batch parameter must be used in the function of sampling, which makes the number of all training samples must be divisible by batch. Actually, the practical number of training samples is often not divisible, like the number 1133. As a result, I can only set batch=1 or batch=1133. How can I solve the question above?
If you give me some advice, I would be very grateful.
