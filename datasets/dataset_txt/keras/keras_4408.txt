To reproduce please clone the repo with the docker files that I had used to isolate my installation to just the required pieces.
Given a docker machine is present the steps to reproduce should be
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/run.sh
The docker images will be built with the latest versions of Theano and Keras so I must be missing something simple that someone with experience can point out to me so that I can learn.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
