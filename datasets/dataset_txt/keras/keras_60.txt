I have a pretrained model with bidirectional LSTM layer for which I want to set return_sequences=True. I am trying as:
config=model.layers[-1].get_config()
config['layers']['config']['return_sequences']=True
This changes the value of return_sequences in dictionary config. But I do not know how to set this configuration in layer. Something like, is not working.
model.layers[-1]=LSTM.from_config(config)
It gives init takes at least two arguments.
Layer[-1] of model is actually a bidirectional wrapped LSTM.
