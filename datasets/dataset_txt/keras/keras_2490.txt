I am trying to develop an Intrusion Detection System based on deep learning using Keras.
We simulated a NORMAL network traffic and I prepared it in CSV file (numerical dataset of network packets fields (IP source, port,etc..)). But I do not have the ABNORMAL (malicious) packets to train the neural network on.
I searched for problems like that and I found that Autoencoder is a good approach in unsupervised learning, but the thing is that I am new to deep learning, and I only found this example Image Recognition with Autoencoder where they are using Autoencoder on images dataset.
I want to use Autoencoder (or any thing useful in my case) with numerical CSV dataset in order to predict if the incoming packet is normal or malicious.
Any recommendation?
