Hello there,
I am experimenting with keras and imagenet , my network is setup so is everything else, I am just making sure that my inputs are correct by asking you here. So basically I take the JPEG images and resize them , change their format from BGR to RGB and finally using numpy change their shape so they would fit the shape of the network (samples,3,224,224), when I load them with OpenCV the format is 224,224,3 so I have to reshape them , but I am afraid that numpy may not be reshaping them correctly. Can you tell me if what I am doing looks correct?
file=cv2.imread(filename)
file=cv2.resize(file,(224,224))
file=cv2.cvtColor(file, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
file=np.array(image).reshape((3,224,224))
files.append([file])
print(file.shape[0])
