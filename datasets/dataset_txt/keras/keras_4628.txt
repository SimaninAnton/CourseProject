Some research papers showed the benefit to adjust dropout rate over epochs.
Specifically, they used this dropout rate:
max(0,cur/N)*initial_dropoutrate
where cur is the current epoch and N is a fixed parameter.
How can I achieve this using Keras? I think I can re-write the call function in the dropout layer but the problem is that how can I get the epoch variable.
