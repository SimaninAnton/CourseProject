Hi,
I am trying to implement a multi layer NN with a custom loss function.
Suppose I have the following function,
def custom_loss(y_true,y_pred):  

    loss = T.mean(T.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1)  

    return loss  
(which is just the default MSE code)
If I want to add a variable or a function of a few variables that are taken from the outside the NN - is it possible to do so?
for example:
def custom_loss(y_true,y_pred):  

    loss = T.mean(T.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1) + T.dot(a1,a2)  

    return loss  
where a1,a2 are defined outside.
