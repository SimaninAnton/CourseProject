I am new to Keras and trying to implement a convolution neural network for predicting handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using the theano backend.
I tried with having a MaxPooling2D layer in my model and it gives a good result. I am planning to try on a pooling method that will give the max value and the min value on the feature map (essentially doing two poolings on the feature map). I realized that Keras uses pool2d function from theano and they don't have a implementation of a min pooling.
I am wondering is there any way to implement a custom pooling layer in Keras just like using a custom objective function?
Thanks!
