Hello everyone,
I would like to know if with the current backend and the graph api it is possible to extract the representation in a predeterminate node for a given example. If it is not i would like to understand how to create a fast workaround.
I have seen a post in the past that was for Sequential layers using Theano. My request is to know if it is possible to create general API that works container-wise.
My idea is to extract the representation of the penultimate layer of the network to stack on top other kind of classifiers. (SVM and possible Kernels for instance) So i need to extract the feature vectors from the network.
Thanks you.
