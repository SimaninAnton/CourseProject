Hello, i have a triplet network like below and i want in lambda layer to have a global table will be used in calculations and also will be updated. i have also a custom objective for triplet loss.
how can i achieve this?
another way is to compute the gradients apart from train procedure and only doing a backpropagation.
specifically, my problem is:
table1 = somedata;
for each epoch:
for each batch:
outputs = model.predict ()
table1 = UpdateValues(table1, ouputs)
loss = CalcLoss (outputs, table1)
gradients = CalcGradients (loss, table1)
backward pass(gradients)
end
end
