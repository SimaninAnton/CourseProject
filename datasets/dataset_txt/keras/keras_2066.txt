Hello,
My problem is about how to mask variable-length sequences for stacked BÄ°-LSTM Networks. At first, we tried Embedding Layer with mask_zero=True option but it gave us nan loss(later it gave an Invalid Argument Error). Then, we explicitly used a Masking Layer with an Embedding Layer.
So, what is the correct way of doing masking?
Thanks
