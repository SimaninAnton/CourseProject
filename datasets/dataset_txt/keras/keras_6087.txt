I'm using a siamese network with three different outputs.
Two of them are the classification and the other is an additional label I use.
The question is, how the loss given in the callback is computed?
I'm sure it is not the sum since I have computed it and does not match, but it is a bit messy to follow the logic in the code.
The three outputs are using MAE as the optimizer.
Moreover, It would be nice to be able to monitor each of the loss values in the callback.
