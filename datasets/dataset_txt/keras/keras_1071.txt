I have several embeddings matrices, lets say E1 matrix is for Glove and E2 is for Word2vec.
I would like to build a simple sentiment classifier which takes trainable weighted sum of this embeddings.
For example, for the word "dog" I would like to get x["dog"]*E1["dog"] + y["dog"]*E2["dog"] when x and y are learned parameters (notice that I want to learn x and y for each word
I know I need to somehow learn the X vector and Y vector and use merge with "add", but I have no idea how to actually do it, help will be highly appreciated
