I, for my application have created a custom Regularizer. And I wish to vary the "weight decay constant" after every certain number of epcohs. Is this implementation possible with callback ?
Example code:
from keras import backend as K
def l1_reg(weight_matrix):
return 0.01 K.sum(K.abs(weight_matrix))
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=64,
kernel_regularizer=l1_reg))
model.compile()
Now I want to vary the 0.01 in the l2_reg, after every certain number epcohs.
I have tried a similar approach which was followed for decaying learning rate. But I am not able to implement using that idea, correctly. Any suggestions would be really helpful.
Thanks!
