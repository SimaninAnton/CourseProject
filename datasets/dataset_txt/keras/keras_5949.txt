Hello fchollet, or whoever is responsible of Keras.io website,
I have noted an misunderstanding between the literature and the Dropout feature in Keras package.
In Hinton paper, the best way to prevent overfitting with dropout is for dropout = 0.8 which means that they keep 80% of the input layer
In Keras, using dropout = 0.8 means that you set to zero 80% of the layer (cf here http://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout)
If you want to keep it this way, which I think make more sense than the paper, maybe you should emphasize it a little more in your website.
Best,
