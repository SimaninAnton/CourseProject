Hi all,
I get a warning:
UserWarning: Output "custom_variational_layer_1" missing from loss dictionary. We assume this was done on purpose, and we will not be expecting any data to be passed to "custom_variational_layer_1" during training.
Although the file can still running and give results. But as I change the dimension of the latent space in the"variational_autoencoder_deccon.py ", there is some input dimension problem:
ValueError: Input dimension mis-match. (input[0].shape[0] = 7840, input[4].shape[0] = 25000)
Anyone has an idea, I will be appreciate it very much.
