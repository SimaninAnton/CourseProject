First , I appreciate your contribution for deep learning , I think keras is amazing for me to build a nn,
But I have trouble with speedã€‚ As a ordinary student ,I can't afford a gpu ,so I might choose to use caffe which is said to be faster ,Therefore,I look for the method to convert model to caffe or a method to make my model in keras work faster without gpu,thanks very much !
