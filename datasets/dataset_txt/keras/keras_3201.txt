Hi,
When reading through some blogpost regarding keras implementations, I see some comments about sequential model and general model. For instance, VGG is sequential and Alexnet is not. I am quite confusing about this comments. And moreover, when should we use sequential, and when should we use general model to implement some deep learning models in Keras?
