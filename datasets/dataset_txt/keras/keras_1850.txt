hello, i recently use a CNN+LSTM model to do some NLP tasks ï¼Œbut the input size of sequences is variable.I try the LSTM model with masking layer and it works well. In fact ,my model doesn't require a fixed length of input and the docs also say Conv1D can solve the variable input. However ,the fit need the fixed shape of trainx and trainy. One solution is separate the different length of sequences and make up
a list of data of fixed shape. And you also can train one sequence each time but the result is worse than LSTM which in a paper it should be better. My question is since the model can accept different length,why
the fit function still check the input shape?
