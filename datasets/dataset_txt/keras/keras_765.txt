As far as I can tell from documentation, Keras does not have a MatrixMultiplication layer, only Dense, TimeDistributed and the dot function. Is that correct?
If so, this feature request is to add layers.MatrixMultiply(). Naturally one can implement this using a custom layer and dot. But why would this be required for the general population?
The calling semantics would be something like:
layers.MatrixMultiply((l, m))(input) # input is a batch of (m x n) tensors.
