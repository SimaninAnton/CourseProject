as above picture described,I have some doubt about:
self.weights = [K.variable(np.zeros(K.get_value(p).shape)) for p in params]
it seems that every time we call get_update() method,self.weights will be a zero numpy tensorvariable!!!
but according to SGD's definition,it should be the delta value of the last batch,which we call "momemtum"
Did I miss something ? I just cannot figure it out...
