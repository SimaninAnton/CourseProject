Hi, I came across some weird behaviour today running this simple script:
from keras import backend as K
import numpy as np
kvar = K.variable(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), dtype='float32')
K.eval(kvar)
Which gave this output:
Using TensorFlow backend.
Out[1]:
array([[  1.00000000e+00,   3.15087917e-29],
       [  8.61639512e-36,   4.50566121e+15]], dtype=float32)
My TF version is 1.0.1.
Has anybody else come across this??
