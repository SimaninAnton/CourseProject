When I execute model.get_weights() , It seems each BN layer have 4 parameters serially
I believe there are gamma , inverse stdev , Gamma , beta are included.
But I cannot sure the order of the parameter.
what is the first parameter?
what is the second parameter?
what is the third parameter?
what is the fourth parameter?
It will be grateful for me to know.
