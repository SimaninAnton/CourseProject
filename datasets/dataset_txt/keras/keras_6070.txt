as of the backend change, standardize_weights doesn't work correctly with return_sequences=True.
assuming I have a mini-batch size of 1600, and my y.shape == (1600, 20, 1000), and my weights.shape == (1600, 20, 1) if I call standardize_weights(y, None, None) I get weights with shape (1600,), but If I call standardize_weights(y, weights, None) I get weights with shape (32000,), e.g. my weights are just flattened and returned.
What is the purpose of the flatten call?
