Hi all,
I've wanted to double check my setup with you guys for the example problem "lstm_text_generation.py".
I am currently training it on the GPU, and it takes 30min per one iteration. That's a long time.
What numbers are you getting? I am worried that I've configured something wrong and that's why it is so slow.
My machine: Geforce 650M, 12GB RAM, i7-3612QM@2.1GHz
