I have got the Keras' VGG 16 model from https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3. For fine tuning in caffe, we change the final layer's output to desired the number of classes and relearn the weights of the final layer.
How do I do the same in Keras?
For e.g: Instead of 1000 classes, I want now 47 classes.
