Hey,
I'm using both tensorflow and theano. Although for big modules tensorflow is much better - building time wise.
I'm using the lastest keras version (master branch) and tensorflow version 1
I have a dataset around 7000 images. Theano run a single apoch in around 70 seconds.tensorwflow runs this apoch around 800 seconds.
What can cause such a huge difference comparing tensorflow?
Thanks
