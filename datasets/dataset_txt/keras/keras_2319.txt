The following script
from keras.metrics import fbeta_score
Gives me this error:
ImportError: cannot import name 'fbeta_score'
And this script:
from keras.metrics import *
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy', 'fbeta_score'])
Gives me this error:
ValueError: ('Unknown metric function', ':fbeta_score')
So I assume that fbeta_score function is not implemented, as it says in the documentation.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
