Hi, trying to create input conv1d layer, my data is 64 bytes.
I find it hard to figure out the meaning of the parameters ...
nb_filter: Number of convolution kernels to use (dimensionality of the output).
filter_length: The extension (spatial or temporal) of each filter.
What is "nb" shortcut for ?
filter_length ? is this the conv kernel size ?
Then there are the input and output shape which include steps and samples ? I thought the shape is provided by input_shape ?
I used this :
model.add(Convolution1D(64,1,input_shape=(1,64), border_mode='same') )
but not sure if it is correct ?
If you could point me to some explanation of Conv args in general as used in software, rather than math.
Also is there a way to print the dimentions/shapes of the layers and other information ?
