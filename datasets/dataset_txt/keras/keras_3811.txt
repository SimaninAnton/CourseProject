Hello everyone, I am a fresher in Keras . Now I encountered a problem that how to feed multiple outputs of previous layers to a successive lstm layer.My model(part) is just like below:
batch_size = 64
output_1 = Dense(output_dim=(128, ), input_dim=(200, ))
output_2 = Dense(output_dim=(128,), input_dim=(200, ))
output_3 = Dense(output_dim=(128,), input_dim=(200, ))
output_4 = Dense(output_dim=(128,), input_dim=(200, ))
and then how to feed all above outputs to a lstm ? the input_dim should be like (batch_size, number_of_previous_outputs, 128)
