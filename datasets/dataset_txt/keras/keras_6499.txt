LImited weight sharing is used in speech recognition, you can found brief description of it in this link: http://recognize-speech.com/acoustic-model/knn/comparing-different-architectures/convolutional-neural-networks-cnns
Is it possible in keras ?
I think the idea is similar to using many convolution layer for each subregion of spectra image, the issue is how to make a clean implementation of this operator, especially when each subregion will need different pooling layer.
