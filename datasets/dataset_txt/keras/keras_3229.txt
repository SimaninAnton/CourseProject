According to Keras docuementation, A metric is a function that is used to judge the performance of your model. Metric functions are to be supplied in the metrics parameter when a model is compiled.
Is metric used to evaluate the performance only? Will it also affect the training process? I am not very clear about this.
For instance, model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=1e-5), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['binary_crossentropy']) . I am using binary_crossentropy as the objective function for the training process. what are the proper setup for the metrics? Here I just use binary_crossentropy as well, can I use other metrics? Does it really matter?
