I thought I had read about this topic here before, but I can't seem to find the issue.
I would like to implement an activity based regularisation, but I don't think this is possible right now. I think it would be possible to include the option to do this without breaking the API but it would include some additional complexity in the code (in particular around here).
What I want to implement is a sparseness regularisation like descibed by Andrew Ng here.
I realize this might be an obscure use case. Would you be interested in merging such a modification?
