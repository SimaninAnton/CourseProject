First, I love the keras.utils.visualize_util module. It makes a quick summary of the neural network possible.
But it would be nice to also annotate the visualization with the expected input and output shape. This would make debugging the neural network easier.
How does a change to keras.utils.visualize_util.plot and keras.utils.visualize_util.to_graph with this feature sound?
