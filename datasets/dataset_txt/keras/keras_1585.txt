I am running tensorflow 1.3.0 backend for keras 2.0.8.
While running the following code
    import keras.backend as K

    input_img = Input(shape=(64,64,3))

    x1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_img)

    gateFactor = Input(tensor = K.variable([0.3]))

    fractionG = Multiply()([x1,gateFactor])

    complement = Lambda(lambda x: x[0] - x[1])([x1,fractionG])

    x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(fractionG)
PS: All functions are properly imported. Complete code can be found here
The following RunTimeError occurs while creating the model
RuntimeError: Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor <tf.Variable 'Variable_2:0' shape=(1,) dtype=float32_ref> at layer "input_6". The following previous layers were accessed without issue: ['input_5', 'conv2d_11']
