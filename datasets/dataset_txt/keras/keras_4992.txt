I have a model which contains Paragraphs. Paragraphs in turn contains Sentences. Thus I want to feed in a (Batch_size, nb_para_in_document, nb_sent_in_para) to my embedding layer as input to my Embedding layer and obtain a (Batch_size, nb_para, nb_sent, Word_vector) as ouput. I tried using TimeDistributed(Embedding(10000, 64), input_shape = (20, 10)) but it raises
''TypeError: index must be integers''
