The following script fails with Keras 1.0.4, but worked with 1.0.3:
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation
from keras.models import Sequential
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, input_dim=2),
    Activation('relu'),
    Dense(10),
    Activation('softmax'),
])
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd')
model.fit([[0,1], [1,1], [1,0]], [1,2,3])
gives the following exception:
Exception: Error when checking model target: expected activation_6 to have shape (None, 10) but got array with shape (3, 1)
The check doesn't seem to take into account the sparse categorical entropy loss (which should only take one integer target per training example). This has been tested with both Tensorflow and Theano backend.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
