Hello,
I am using a Keras-Model with an Embedding plane filled with weights from GloVe (not trainable).
Now, I want to change a small part of the weights before each prediction. However, changing the full matrix with set_weights() takes 0.3 seconds. This is far too long. Is there a way to change only 1 row of the matrix a time, and is this faster?
Or is there a way to change the first 2 layers (Input & Embedding) of a model after training? If yes, how?
Thanks and kind regards
Ernst
