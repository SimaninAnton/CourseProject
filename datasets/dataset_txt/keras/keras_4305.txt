I saved a model's weight in an HDF5 file and I am trying to load it to initialize a different model (with a different output layer) using this command:
model.load_weights('model_weights.h5', by_name=True)
But I got this error:
TypeError: load_weights() got an unexpected keyword argument 'by_name'
Could anyone help?
