from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input
import numpy as np

model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

img_path = 'elephant.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = preprocess_input(x)

features = model.predict(x)
the code above comes from official keras documentation in https://keras.io/applications/
I got 2 problems
Can't download weight file(timeout); I solved it by using my own downloader to download weight file named vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5 and store it in ~/.keras/models/ folder.
and then when i execute the code above(just replace 'elephant.jpg' with my own picture), predict function returns None.... yes, no error, return None, I don't know why...
I'm sure i use the latest version of both keras and tensorflow, and this problem also occurs when i change vgg16 to vgg19.
Can anyone help? THANKS!!!
