Assume our model have two outputs :
output 1 'class' for classification
output 2 'location' for regression
Now we have the imbalance dataset(eg. binary classification, class '0': 98 percent, class '1': 2 percent), so we need set the class_weight params in model.fit() function, but for output 2 'location' regression task, we do not need class_weight.
How can we set the class_weight in this situation?
Does "class_weight = {0: ratio 1 , 1: ratio 2} is applied the classification task and ignore the regression task by defaultï¼Ÿ
