Hi,
I've just upgraded Keras, and it seems that the SReLu are not available anymore.
from keras.layers.advanced_activations import PReLU, SReLU, ELU
ImportError: cannot import name 'SReLU'
And I don't see them anymore in the documentation either: https://keras.io/layers/advanced-activations/
What's wrong with the SReLu?
