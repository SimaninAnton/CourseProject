I'm using Keras with Voxel grids , so I use Convolution 3D and other 3D layers heavily. I'm using Theano as backend.
I want to shift to using Multiple GPUs for my project. I'm planning to buy GPUs conditioned on the fact that I can use it with Keras. Hence I'm asking here before buying the GPUs.
Looking at previous forum questions, these two issues exist, that put me in a deadlock:
Multiple GPU support currently is only available with Tensorflow
3D Layer support (like Convolution 3D) are only available with Theano.
Have any of these 2 changed, considering the other posts were over a month old..?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
