I used the script variational_autoencoder_.py, I save the model of vae, when i want to load the saved model use the code belowed:
from keras.models import load_model
model=load_model('mnist_vae_try100.h5')
It occurred an error:
NameError: name 'batch_size' is not defined
I think it is because the vae use the variable variable,
Pleased help me, thanks !
