keras version 2.2.4 does not recognize pathlib
from pathlib import Path
h5filepath = ...
load_model(h5filepath) # OK
load_model(Path(h5filepath)) # ERR
saying TypeError: Required Group, str or dict. Received: <class 'pathlib.WindowsPath'>.
The previous version (2.2.2 or so) was running flawlessly: guess the type assert is now missing in the new version 2.2.4
