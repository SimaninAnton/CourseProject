I found that LamdaMerge was deleted from core.py and keras.io.
I want to implement a merge mode of the euclidean distance (euclidean is from scipy).
My left model is a Sequential RNN while the right model is a Sequential CNN.
Here is a snippet of my current code.
def edis(inputs):
    l1 = inputs[0]
    l2 = inputs[1]
    return euclidean(l1,l2)

model =  Sequential()
model.add(LambdaMerge(layers=[left,right], mode=edis))
Now I couldn't find the LambdaMerge source code in core.py. Is it removed from keras?
If I want to implement a custom-defined merge code, is the only way to modify source code of Merge model? It seems that the Merge layer is also moved to another py file. Since I can only find the following code line related to Merge in core.py.
from ..engine import InputSpec, Layer, Merge
p.s. This is the previous snippet about LamdaMerge in my local downloaded keras package.
`class LambdaMerge(Lambda):
'''LambdaMerge layer for evaluating an arbitrary Theano / TensorFlow
function over multiple inputs.
# Output shape
    Specified by output_shape argument

# Arguments
    layers - Input layers. Similar to layers argument of Merge
    function - The function to be evaluated. Takes one argument:
        list of outputs from input layers
    output_shape - Expected output shape from function.
        Could be a tuple or a function of list of input shapes
    arguments: optional dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed
        to the function.
