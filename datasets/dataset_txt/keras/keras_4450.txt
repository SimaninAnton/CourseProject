I have a test data which contains 20 features and 1 class label (10 class label) but test data has 20 features and 1 class label (20 class label). I have numeric feature values i used lstm, cnn for classification. I am able train model but when i test it with model.evaluate generates an error. How to correct this? Then i used y_pred = model.predict_classes. Then i used scikit for accuracy calculation. But it is giving same accuracy for both lstm and cnn around 80%. I also tried another way i removed all the rows which has class label from 11 to 20 and i i had given model.evalute..This works and giving 99 percentage accuracy in one epoch itself. The accuracy reduces in 20 class label test data is that because of scikit? How to re correct it.
