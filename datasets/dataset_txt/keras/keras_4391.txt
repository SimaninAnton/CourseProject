I have a question about cosine distance:
In the wikipedia article, the denominator is defined as sqrt(sum(a)) * sqrt(sum(b)), in keras, it is implemented as sqrt(sum(a) * sum(b)). Why does the implementation differ?
Also in keras, does the implementation refer to similarity or to distance? And is the range (-1, 1) or (0,1)?
