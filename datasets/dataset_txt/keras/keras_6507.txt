I installed Keras yesterday. I think the version is the newest. I just uninstalled Theano and reinstalled the Theano from Theano-master. Now I still get the following TypeErrors:
model.add(Dense(10, init='uniform', input_dim=2))
TypeError: init() got multiple values for keyword argument 'input_dim'
model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(784,)))
TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'input_shape'
Could anyone tell what I can do? Thank you!
