I have timeseries data, in multiple channels, with shape=(n_steps, n_channels)
I want to do a convolution in the time dimension, similar to this:
Convolution1D(n_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(n_steps, n_channels))
However, this will train a separate filter for each channel - apparently the weights get shape=(filter_size, 1, n_channels, n_filters).
I want to apply the same filter for all channels (weight sharing), so the weights will have shape=(filter_size, 1, 1, n_filters).
Can this be done with Keras?
