Add target_shape to init parameters and resize transformation to ImageDataGenerator.
Motivation:
Some transformation like rotation, scaling works better on larger images due to interpolation.
Proposed solution.
Have resizing be last transformation in pipeline.
Open CV is nice option as it faster then scipy, but requires this dependency.
