Hello,
I just want to verify if the keras early call back retains the weight at the best network performance or does it retain the weight after the end of the patience?
i.e. if my network at x epoch had 80% validation accuracy and at x+3 epoch it stops training but validation accuracy is now 70%.
Does keras retain the weights at the epoch x or at epoch x+3?
