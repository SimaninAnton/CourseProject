I can't figure out how to supply a masked output to an RNN layer, without using the Embeddings layer before it.
Say I have X of shape (1000, len, 500), how to I pad the len dimension correctly, and make SimpleRNN (or LSTM or GRU) understand that this is only padding? If this is the first layer there is no such way... Am i write?
