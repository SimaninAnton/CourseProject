I need to define a custom loss function of multi-class logarithmic loss, the formula is show in the picture.

Just like the def categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):, I wonder is y_true an array of softmax probability, and y_pred an array of one-hot encoded array. Can I just use numpy to calculate the loss value without use the backend (K).
I am a newbie, I hope someone can tell me how to write a function of that loss function in the figure?
