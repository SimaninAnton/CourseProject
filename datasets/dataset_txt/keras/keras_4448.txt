Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hi,
I was doing batch learning using a batchsize of 256. I found the error at fit model.
h = [newm.fit(trainGen.x,trainGen.y,batch_size=256, nb_epoch=10, validation_data=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight=None, verbose=1)]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "keras-adapt/adapt_tmp.py", line 68, in
h = [newm.fit(trainGen.x,trainGen.y,batch_size=256, nb_epoch=learning['minEpoch'], validation_data=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight=None, verbose=1)]

AttributeError: 'ProgbarLogger' object has no attribute 'log_values'
I was calling next function in fit command. It combines all the input and output features of all splits.
def next (self):
while (self.splitDataCounter <= self.numSplit):
x,y = self.getNextSplitData()
self.x = numpy.concatenate ((self.x[self.batchPointer:], x))
self.y = numpy.concatenate ((self.y[self.batchPointer:], y))
self.splitDataCounter += 1
    return (self.x, self.y)
I am new to this keras. Could you please help me how to solve this issue.
Thanks
