Just a quick question: I can quickly build a single layer bi-directional (BiRNN) layer using the functional api (and example). My question is, how does one go about building a deep BiRNN giving the current api and how does this change if the RNN is LSTM?
p.s I have seen this #1629 Is this the only way? Im also referencing the architectures built here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6026.pdf.
Any advice would be great!
