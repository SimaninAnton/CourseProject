Hi there,
First of all I should mention that Keras is brilliant. Keep up the great work.
I'm training two stacked LSTM layers for a vector-2-vector mapping. The model is:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(embedding_size, hidden_size, activation='sigmoid', truncate_gradient=-1, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(hidden_size, output_size, activation='sigmoid', truncate_gradient=-1, return_sequences=True))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
Training the model works fine. For one epoch:
  Epoch 0
  9500/9500 [==============================] - 125s - loss: 0.0054 - acc: 0.2139 - val_loss: 0.0038 - val_acc: 0.0475
However, the evaluation code:
model.evaluate(Xtest, Ytest, batch_size=batch_size, show_accuracy=True, verbose=1)
Does not output anything informative:
  Evaluation...
  401/401 [==============================] - 1s    
The above is all that happens before ending, without any loss/accuracy values.
Any suggestions?
Thanks!
