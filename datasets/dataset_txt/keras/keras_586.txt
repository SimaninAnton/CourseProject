A year to the day that this issue was first reported, when @fchollet called it "a serious issue", this has still not been fixed, unfortunately. I suspect it has got lost in the system, which is unfortunate as without multi-threading it is difficult to consider keras for production use in large servers, which surely is what Tensorflow (and Keras) is all about?
Here's the original issue:
#8595
Could somebody look at this please?
Thanks,
