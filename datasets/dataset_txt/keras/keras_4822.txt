I used Theano for the keras.
When I ran the example code imdb_cnn.py, I got nan for loss after a few seconds.
I changed the .theanorc.txt files as follows:
[global]
openmp=False
allow_gc=False
optimizer = fast_run
floatX = float32
device = cpu
[blas]
ldflags=
[gcc]
cxxflags = -ID:\Anaconda2\MinGW\include
So how do I solve this problem?
thanks.
