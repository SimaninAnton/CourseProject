Hi, i defined a two-level custom loss function in my model , it works well in training. But when i try to load saved model, keras shows:
    def customLoss(self, weight, graph_dis, lamda1=0.2):
        def lossFunction(y_true,y_pred):  
            loss1 = categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
            loss2 =K.mean(K.mean(multiply([(K.ones_like(weight) - weight), graph_dis])))
            loss = loss1 + lamda1 * loss2
            return loss
        return lossFunction
ValueError: Unknown loss function:lossFunction
and, How do I solve this error? thanks.
