I understand the stateful LSTM prediction example in Keras on a single sequence. That example has one sequence of 50k observations.
My questions for all you experts out there:
What if you want to train multiple sequences of 50k observations? Say other sequences that start/end at different values and have a slightly different behavior?
How to modify the example to increase the prediction time step?
Are LSTMs even any good for that sort of thing?
I've posted the full question including sample code over here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39758190/time-series-prediction-with-keras-and-multiple-sequences
Thanks for your help!
