I'am doing project on real time face recognition, I found a code on github which uses Yale dataset and I got accuracy of 89%, I've changed the dataset and save the weight. Now I want to make it real time, So now I load an Image and convert it to numpy array then reshape it and pass it though classes = loaded_model.predict_classes(img)
Now here I am getting an error which says : Exception: Error when checking : expected dense_input_1 to have shape (None, 22500) but got array with shape (22500, 1)
I just want to know that in predict_classes function what type of data feed required a numpy array 1d or 2d ?
