I would like to ask a more general question about the analysis of historical loss and accuracy over epochs. I have used keras for training a ConvNet regression problem. The loss and accuracy visualization is below. The loss seems to be OK. But look at the accuracy figure, the valid does not seem to be reasonable. What problem may I occur? Overfitting? Underfitting ?
