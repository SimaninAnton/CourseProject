Ok so from what I understood in the fit_generator function the generator given to validation_data is destroyed at every epoch instead of getting more samples for the same generator.
Is there any reason for this?
In my case this is not desirable as when the generator is created it first makes a connection to a database (aws RDS) and then processes the data. This is time consuming as is not required to be done at every epoch.
