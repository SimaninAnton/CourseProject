It look like in https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py#L793, all callbacks have their verbose parameter overwritten by whatever was passed to fit.
This is a bit of a pain in some situations, for instance: I would like to train the model with the progbar logger at verbosity=2 (the progress bar messes up my log files), and all other callbacks with verbosity 1. Is there a way to do this?
If not, would you accept a PR that simply removes the particular line I pointed to, and instead applies it only to the default callbacks?
