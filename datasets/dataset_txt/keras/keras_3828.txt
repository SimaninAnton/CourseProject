In the case "Using pre-trained word embeddings in a Keras model", I noticed that every document in 20news has the classification label. For example:
Newsgroups: rec.autos

It's the 103723 in rec.autos, at the first line you may notice that it's a document in newsgroup rec.autos. Does that affects the classification accuracy? That's why the accuracy up to 0.96? Is that a mistake?
