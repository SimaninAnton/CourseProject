Specifically trying to save the entire MaskRCNN model implemented here
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
In line 2343 of https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/blob/master/mrcnn/model.py basically changed save_weights_only to False from True
        keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(self.checkpoint_path,
                                        verbose=0, save_weights_only=False),
if  save_weights_only=False is done then the following error is reported

    augmentation=augmentation)
