UserWarning: Epoch comprised more than samples_per_epoch samples, which might affect learning results. Set samples_per_epoch correctly to avoid this warning.
I have around 20k training images,
        train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
                zoom_range=0.2,
                rotation_range=20,
            width_shift_range=0.1,
            height_shift_range=0.1,
                horizontal_flip=False)
...
...
model.fit_generator(
                train_datagen.flow(train_data,train_target,batch_size=40,shuffle=1),
                samples_per_epoch=2520,
                nb_epoch=400)
Ideally this should train with 2520 each epoch, however I gives 2507 on the 9th epoch every time. It says " UserWarning: Epoch comprised more than samples_per_epoch samples, which might affect learning results. Set samples_per_epoch correctly to avoid this warning."
