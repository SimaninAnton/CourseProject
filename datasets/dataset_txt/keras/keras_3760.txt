Hi everyone,
I was wondering if using keras on a production server was a good idea ?
I want to make request to my server to predict some images.
But I'm not sure how I should do that..
Because, with the GPU, in case of a lot of requests, I'm affraid than CUDA fails while allocating memory for prediction. (And crash the server)
Should I use the CPU for the predictions ? Is it even possible if I trained my model on the GPU ?
But there again, even if it work, use the CPU could take a long time..
How should I do it ?
Thanks to you!
