Hello
I would like to learn a model that predicts some labels A, B and C out of a representation
But sometimes, I only know that B=1 and have no information about A or C, so I don't know whether A is true or false.
How do I model this in keras? I could make 2^3 different losses, one for each possibility but it would force a given batch order
Thanks
