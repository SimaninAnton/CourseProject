Trying to run VGG16 on windows PC using Keras. When the VGG16 weights are downloading after about 33 MB of 58 MB are downloaded there is an error saying ‘An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host’. this happens every time like there is a timeout on Github. Suggestions solicited.
