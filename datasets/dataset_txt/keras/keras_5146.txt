Hi,
I used fit_generator in my code, but it throw an exception recently as following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "model3.py", line 149, in <module>
validation_data=(X_test, Y_test))
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/models.py", line 651, in fit_generator

'or (x, y). Found: ' + str(generator_output))
Exception: output of generator should be a tuple (x, y, sample_weight) or (x, y). Found: None

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'stack'
It seems that numpy has no attribute stack.  Is there any change in fit_generator? Why can’t I used that as normal? Thanks!
