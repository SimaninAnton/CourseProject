Hello,
Never contributed to Keras before, but I am interested in creating a PR with a new feature, but before I do so, I want to get feedback and check if it would be accepted :P
The function ``fit_generator'' is extremely useful, but it is difficult to use parallelized. It expects a generator, which are not thread-safe in Python. Alternatively, it can run each generator on a different process, but then it is likely that you would end with duplicated observations across processes since generators can't talk to each other.
The class keras.utils.Sequence is a very useful work-around, but it's not very well documented and not easy to use (it requires an undocumented OrderedEnqueuer wrapper, etc.) I am interested in creating a fit_sequence method that takes care of this.
Thoughts?
Thanks,
Jose
