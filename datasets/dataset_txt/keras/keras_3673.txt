Hello, recently I have noticed this issue that when I try to standardize my test set using my training data generator (let's call it "datagen"), using the line:
X_TEST_scaled = datagen.standardize(X_TEST)
It returns the scaled version of X_TEST, but it also alters the original X_TEST tensor, which makes me lose my original X_TEST data.
Please let me know if I am doing something wrong, or is this the intended behaviour (in which it's pretty weird).
