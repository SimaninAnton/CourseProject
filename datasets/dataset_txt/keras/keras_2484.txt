Hi,
I have 2 neural net, let's say NN1 and NN2
and I would like to fit alpha1x NN1 + alpha2 xNN2 (alpha i some constant ) to fit some specific target.
I heard that I can use merge function :
merged_vector = keras.layers.concatenate([NN1, NN2],)
but ho to tel merged_vector to output something like alpha1x NN1 + alpha2 xNN2
and train it to fit a target?
Thanks you in advance.
