Hi everyone,
I have a reasonably big dataset of images, and I'm trying to train the Inception Model on it.
The problem is, when I try to use the Image Generator (To apply random transformations), I get a MemoryError.
This is weird, because, when I fit my model without the generator (So without transformations) I have no problem.
Possibly, the generator has some memory leaks ?
(I train the model with train_on_batch method and yield batch_size from the generator)
If there are no solutions, is there a way to apply transformations to images without the generator ?
(By each images possibly ?)
Thanks!
