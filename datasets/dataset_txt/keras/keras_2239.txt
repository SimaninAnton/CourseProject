Hi;
I am not sure whether keras forum is the right place to ask this question. until 3 days ago, I am using keras 1.1 and theano 0.8. My computer have 2 gpus. Operating system is windows 7. I am canopy user. I can run two seperate theano code (in different python exe) without any lock by setting theano flag. I upgraded cuda, cudann, theano and keras 8, 5.1, 0.9 and 2.04 respectively. I can run keras with "gpuarray warning". Speed is better than previous setup. But i can't run two gpus seperately because of theano lock (I set device gpu0 and gpu1.
for example os.environ["THEANO_FLAGS"] = "mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu1,floatX=float32"). Then I installed gpuarray. In installation there is no error but when i import keras or theano ( I change device cuda0), python is crashing. I cant pass pygpu.test() . It crashes again. If i change device to gpu0, there is no problem. If i install pygpu, theano and keras with conda ( i am not preferring this choice), it is working but theano lock is still valid for this solution.
I will be gratefull if someone can help me
to find solution running multi gpu seperately
to install pygpu in windows with pip.
Thanks.
