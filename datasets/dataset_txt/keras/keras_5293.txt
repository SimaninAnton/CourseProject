My data looks like these,
X_t=0 = [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0, .....]
X_t=1 = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, .....]
X_t=2 = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, .....]
.......
This is a series of sparse vectors
And I want to train my model to predict the event of next time step.
I am using LSTM with binary cross entropy + adam
But accuracy is not good. (Always stuck in 0.75 acc, it is similar to percentage of 0 in my data )
I think It is always converged to all 0 result.
Why I think like this, when I use init='zero' , It starts with 0.75 accuracy
That is the my convergence point, when I didn't use init='zero'
There are many zeros in my training data.
But I can not use 'softmax', because multiple choice is possible...
The distance between the all zero vector and target is very close.
I am worrying about case that my model just predicts all zero vector in many cases.
Is this issue not worth discussing ?
