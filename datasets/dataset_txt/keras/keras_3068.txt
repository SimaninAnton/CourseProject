my input time series data is of the shape (nb_samples, 75, 32).
75 is the timesteps and 32 is the input dimension.
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(4, input_shape=(75, 32)))
model.summary()
The LSTM weight vectors, [W_i, W_c, W_f, W_o] are all 32 dimensions, but the output is just a single value. the output shape of the above model is (1,4). But in LSTM the output is also a vector so should not it be (32,4) for many to one implementation as above? why is it giving a single value for multi-dimension input also?
