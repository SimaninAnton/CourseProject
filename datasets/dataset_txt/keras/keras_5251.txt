For example: Text1 [A,B,C] Text2 [V,D,Y]
In merge layer, if concat_axis = -1, it means [A,B,C] and [V,D,Y] transform to [A,B,C,V,D,Y] or [V,D,Y,A,B,C] ? What about dot_axis?
How to set the output_shape in merge layer when using lambda or function?
merged_vector2 = merge([encoded_a, encoded_b], mode=lambda x: 1 / (1 + l2_norm(x[0], x[1])),output_shape=lambda x: x[0])means that the output shape of merged_vector2 is as same as encoded_a?
The output of mode = 'cos' merge layer is (1,1) matrix?
Any opinions would be appreciated!
