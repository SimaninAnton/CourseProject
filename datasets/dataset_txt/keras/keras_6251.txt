In the example of imdb_cnn, it is the architecture that convolution 1D, max-pooling 1D, flatten layers and then follows the traditional MLP. I want to study the detailed theoretical explanation, but I have read most about convolution 2D processing images like the paper of Letcun. Which paper can I refer to about convolution1D, max-pooling1D and flatten layers? Many thanks!
