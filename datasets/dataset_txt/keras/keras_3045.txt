In the documentation, the objective functions below are given. I wonder if Keras has maximum likelihood as an objective function. If not what is the easiest way to implement our own objective function?
mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error, mean_squared_logarithmic_error, squared_hinge, hinge, binary_crossentropy, categorical_crossentropy, sparse_categorical_crossentropy, kullback_leibler_divergence, poisson, cosine_proximity
Thanks.
