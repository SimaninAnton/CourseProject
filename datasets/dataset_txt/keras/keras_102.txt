When defining a custom loss function for a classification problem, is there a way to access particular elements of y_true and y_pred?
Use-case: multi-label classification problem where I wanna penalize the model extra if I predict a false positive for class 5 i.e. y_true[5] == 0 but y_pred[5] == 1
I'm defining the loss like:
def loss(y_true, y_pred):
      wt = 10 if (y_true[5]==0 and y_pred[5]==1) else 1
      return wt * binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
My batch size is > 1 (256) and i'm using fit_generator - if that makes any difference. Thanks!
