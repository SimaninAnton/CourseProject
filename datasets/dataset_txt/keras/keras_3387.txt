i was trying to do so stuff in the call() function to make a custom layer.
and of course call() function take the input x like call(self,x):
i did inside it:
print type(x)
print x._keras_shape
print type(x.shape)
print (x.shape)._keras_shape
and the first 3 outputs are:
<class 'theano.tensor.var.TensorVariable'>
(None, 1)
<class 'theano.tensor.var.TensorVariable'>
BUT for the forth output it is an error that says
"AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute '_keras_shape'"
Both of them are Tensor Variables why it output error only in x.shape ?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
