In the documentation on this (http://keras.io/callbacks/) page for callback, it says that the key values for the logs dictionary sent to the on_epoch_end function will contain
val_loss
val_accuracy
The key is actually val_acc. Likewise, for the on_batch_end function, it claims the keys will be
loss
accuracy
Once again, the real keys are loss and acc. Took me a little while to get this sorted out.
