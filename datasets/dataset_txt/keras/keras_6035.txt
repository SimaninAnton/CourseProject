Hi,
I've just achieved a DNN with Keras, but in order to improve my model, I need some optimization overall for all hyper parameters (neuron number, layers, learning-rate etc...), I intend to use both grid search and random search, while i've seen some examples in scikit, but it seems keras isn't compatible with that.
Do I need to implement all by myself?
Or anyone has other idea of getting them?
Thanks a lot.
