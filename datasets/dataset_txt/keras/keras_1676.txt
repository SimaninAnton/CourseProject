Hi,
Is there an easy way to cast the RNN cell of a RNN model of sequence_length=10 into a RNN model with higher sequence length ?
It would be useful since we often restrict sequence_length to make training more efficient, but for inference, execution time might not be critical and it could be better to use different lengths of RNN. (It could even shorten time if we use smaller RNN on smaller sequences)
I know it sounds like dynamic RNN but I think it's less demanding.
We could transfer weights from old one to new one but it sounds a bit messy to me. Is there a better wya ?
Thanks
