Tensorflow currently packs a dynamic RNN function and an experimental scan op. @fchollet, do you think we should add a "scan-based" K.rnn implementation?
I am currently working with some networks that process really long sequences and unrolling the loops in TensorFlow takes forever, but compiling the scan in Theano is fairly quick, so that's an interesting use-case for this. I can run some benchmarks as well.
