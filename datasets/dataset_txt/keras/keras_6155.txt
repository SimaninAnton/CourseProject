I often find myself training a complex graph, then transferring some of the weight matrices to a smaller, simpler one, and use it to attach outputs and compute stuff. However compiling the graph with a loss function I'm never going to use when all I want to do is compute it in a forward manner takes too long for comfort.
Would there be any way to compile a network with no loss function just to run it in "production" mode?
