Hey Keras-Team :).
On your page : https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/#the-concept-of-layer-node
you show how to use multiple outputs when the error:
AttributeError: Layer lstm_1 has multiple inbound nodes,
hence the notion of "layer output" is ill-defined.
Use get_output_at(node_index) instead.
is thrown.
I assume this happens because I am using a dense layer with a softmax function so I can access with the get_output_at function two tensors:
Code:
layer.get_output_at(0)
layer.get_output_at(1)
Output.
Tensor("dense_3/Softmax:0", shape=(?, 7), dtype=float32)
Tensor("test/dense_3/Softmax:0", shape=(?, 7), dtype=float32)
Since I want to use a different models on transfer learning I wrote a simple parser for this. But here is my bottleleck: I want to use the last output of the trained model-layer and connect it to the next inputs of the layer outside of the already trained model. But for this I need to know what is the exact size of the outputs so I can get the latest output by get_output_at method. Sadly it seems not be described in the tutorial (or I am to stupid to find it) how to get the size of the outputs. Note I dont want the shape, rather than the output itself.
So question 1:
How can I know the output size of a layer (that are accessable by get_output_at)
question 2:
Is there a method to determine if there exist multiple outputs for a layer?
Thanks in advance :)
