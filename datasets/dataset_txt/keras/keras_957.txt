The Keras documentation regarding the method 'pad_sequences' seems to be partly confusing.
It states in the last sentence that per default for padding -pre- is being used. However, a few sentences earlier it is stated that the value is padded at the end thus being possibly a bit irritating when not read carefully.
Sequences that are shorter than num_timesteps are padded with value at the end.
Please adjust the description.
