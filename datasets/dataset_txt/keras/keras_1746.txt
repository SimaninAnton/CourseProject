I'm getting this error even with a simple, direct
predict (model, x) where x is a (10, 60) array; I've checked that the # of columns is exactly what the model is expecting. When I look at the code at the referenced area in training.py, I don't even see this error being raised in the function called:
def _standardize_input_data(data, names, shapes=None,
check_batch_axis=True,
exception_prefix=''):
My keras version is up-to-date.
Any pointers will be much appreciated.
