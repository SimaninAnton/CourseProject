I tried to install Keras 2.2.0 and it breaks my codebase when I try to use the legacy submodule
Installing with pip:
sudo pip install --upgrade keras
or
sudo uninstall keras
sudo pip install keras
leads to the following error:
    from keras.legacy import models as legacy_models
  File "/Users/kiddo/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keras/legacy/models.py", line 5, in <module>
    from .layers import Merge
ImportError: cannot import name 'Merge'
I do not use Merge at all, but if Merge is removed, you better completely remove it from keras code.
Installing directly from github repo:
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
cd keras
sudo python setup.py install
leads to the following error:
    from keras.legacy import models as legacy_models
ImportError: cannot import name 'models'
Here the whole submodule (folder) is missing...
I removed calls to legacy from my codebase, but still keras code should be able to load correctly.
