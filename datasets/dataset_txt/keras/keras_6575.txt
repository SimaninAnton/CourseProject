The image data generator's flow method always perform some random deformations (translation, rotation, etc), if those features were selected. However, there should be a method that only applies the normalization options (mean, stnd dev, whitening) and ignores the deformations. Otherwise there is no reasonable way to obtain a normalized version of images at test time without also deforming them.
