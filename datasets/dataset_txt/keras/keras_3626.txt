In this example, the last sequence of the bidirectional LSTM will be used by the next layer right?
The last sequence of the bidirectional LSTM will be just the last sequence of the forward LSTM, concatenated with the first sequence of the backward LSTM, right?
How is it different from a unidirectional LSTM where also only the last layer will be taken?
