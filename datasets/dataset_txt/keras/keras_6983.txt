I have video and audio input and I want to train a joint layer using feedforward neural network. The architecture is as follows:
audio input (goes to) hidden layer (goes to)
video input (goes to) hidden layer (goes to) joint layer (goes to) output
I did this on theano but I wonder if it is doable in Keras. If yes, can you provide me a simple code? Thanks
ps: I couldn't draw the figures as I wanted. The architecture is similar to Figure 3 of this paper http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml11-MultimodalDeepLearning.pdf
