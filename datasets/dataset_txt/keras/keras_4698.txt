Hi,
I am using the variational auto encoder described in http://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html.
My input shape is (22664, 678) and I have changed loss to "categorical_crossentropy". I am not using the customized loss function(I thought that me be causing the problem). And following are parameters values
batch_size = 64
original_dim = 678
latent_dim = 2
intermediate_dim = 45
nb_epoch = 5
My input contains value ranging from 0.5 to 21(most of them are 0s).
The program is giving the following error
Input dimension mis-match. (input[0].shape[0] = 8, input[1].shape[0] = 64) Apply node that caused the error: Elemwise{mul,no_inplace}(Elemwise{Composite{exp((i0 * (i1 + i2)))}}[(0, 1)].0, Reshape{2}.0) Toposort index: 47 Inputs types: [TensorType(float32, matrix), TensorType(float32, matrix)] Inputs shapes: [(8, 2), (64, 2)] Inputs strides: [(8, 4), (8, 4)] Inputs values: ['not shown', 'not shown'] Outputs clients: [[Gemm{inplace}(Elemwise{mul,no_inplace}.0, TensorConstant{1.0},Elemwise{Composite{(i0 * (Abs(i1) + i2 + i3))}}[(0, 2)].0, dense_47_W, TensorConstant{1.0})]] HINT: Re-running with most Theano optimization disabled could give you a back-trace of when this node was created. This can be done with by setting the Theano flag 'optimizer=fast_compile'. If that does not work, Theano optimizations can be disabled with 'optimizer=None'. HINT: Use the Theano flag 'exception_verbosity=high' for a debugprint and storage map footprint of this apply node.
Can someone please explain the reasons behind this?
