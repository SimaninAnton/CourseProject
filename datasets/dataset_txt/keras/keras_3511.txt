Keras has made our life really easy for coding in deep learning. New activation function can be added. But some aspect is not clear. When I try to use Singular value Decomposition(svd) using same way as adding activation function I have failed. While using theano.tensor.nlinalg.svd(x) where x is input matrix it is saying expecting matrix. While using numpy.linalg.svd(x) it's saying getting 0-dim vector expecting 2-dim matrix. How to solve svd problem in keras
