I'm using Debian 8.5 with Python 2.7.9.
Firstly, I could import keras successfully in Shell.
Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar  1 2015, 12:57:24) 
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import keras
Using Theano backend.
>>> from keras.datasets import mnist
>>> 
Then I tried to run this script, and I got following error meesage:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./keras.py", line 8, in <module>
    from keras.datasets import mnist
  File "/home/hzxie/Development/Python/Experiments/Deep-Learning/keras.py", line 8, in <module>
    from keras.datasets import mnist
ImportError: No module named datasets
Then I tried to import keras in Shell again, but failed:
Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar  1 2015, 12:57:24)

So strange isn't it?
