Here is the main info of my workstation:
Ubuntu 16.04
i7-6850k
64GB memory
NVIDIA TITAN X PASCAL
tensorflow 1.0.1
keras 2
I tested both tensorflow-cpu and tensorflow-gpu, and they work perfectly well.
However, when I ran keras on top of both tensorflow-cpu and tensorflow-gpu, the memory blows out within a few seconds and the process was killed like following.
