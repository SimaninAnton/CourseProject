Hi,
Can one create a layer with this library that is connected to two other layers and not only to one?
For example - one can apply a conv and then max pooling on an image and call this layer 1 and then apply only a conv on the original image and call this layer 2. Now we can create a fully connected layer that will be connected to layer1 and layer2. Therefore the network is not linear and can be any kind of a directed acyclic graph.
Thank you!
