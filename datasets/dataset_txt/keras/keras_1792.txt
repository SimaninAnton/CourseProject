I am working on a project which involves the use of a datagen. The project's data consists of data arranged in subclasses that resides in directories named: '1', '2', ..., '64'.
When i checked the results on the test set, I recognized that the datagen rearanged the directories in a non-lexicographic way using a directory as follows:
dict = {'10':0, '11':1, .... , '7':63}. (under the field: validation_generator.indices).
Meaning that if my probabilities vector of size 64, looks like the following:
[1, 0, 0, ... , 0]
The network will consider the samples as class '10'-th, while i want it rearranged in a lexicographic way, meaning the above probabilities vector would be the output of an image belonging to the '0'-th class.
Is there a way of controlling the datagen's labels shuffle system?
