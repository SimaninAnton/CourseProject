hello, I wonder if you could tell me the exact meaning of the attribute regularizer in models.py?
Normally when we define an instance of a sequential, we do not give any value to sequential.model, let alone sequential.model.regularizers. But I found a place which use the attribute and an error occurred 'AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'regularizers'. As for the code, you can view it at https://github.com/berleon/tensorflow_vae/blob/master/variation.py. The error is raised in line 126 when it try to execute line 57
'Millions of thanks!
