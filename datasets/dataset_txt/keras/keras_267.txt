Hi ,
I am trying to retrain Inception V3 pretrained on ImageNet dataset.
I have retrained Inception V3 using Keras(tensorflow backend) with following code :
# SETUP MODEL
    CLASSES = 3
    base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
    x=base_model.output
    x=GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    preds=Dense(CLASSES,activation='softmax')(x) #final layer with softmax activation

    model=Model(inputs=base_model.input,outputs=preds)
    
    # transfer learning
    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False
    
    model.compile(loss="categorical_crossentropy", optimizer='adam',metrics=["accuracy"])
    
    # train the network
    print("[INFO] training network...")
    H = model.fit_generator(
     aug.flow(trainX, trainY, batch_size=BS),
     validation_data=(testX, testY),
     steps_per_epoch=len(trainX) // BS,
     epochs=EPOCHS, verbose=1, callbacks=[csv_logger])
After training for 100 epochs , I get an accuracy between 85% to 90% as shown in plot :
******** Tensorflow **********
I have also retrained Inception V3 pretrained on ImageNet using Tensorflow following the link :
How to Retrain an Image Classifier for New Categories
After 4000 Iterations , I am getting an accuracy between 93% to 96% as shown in plot below :
Could anyone please help me to find the explanation for this reason or please point out the the mistake (if any) , for my interpretation.
Thanks
Rahul
