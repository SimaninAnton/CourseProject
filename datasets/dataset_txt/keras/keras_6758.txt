I'm trying to get acquainted with keras, and if I understood it correctly, sample_weight argument in the fit() takes arrays, and each element of this array is multiplied with the loss value of the corresponding sample. What I am interested in is differentiating these weights for each output node. Can this be done in some way?
To give a background to this question, I am working on a classification problem, where there are 20 output nodes. And for each output node y_m there is a input node x_k, such that if x_k is equal to 0, then y_m is 0. y_m can only be 1 if x_k is 1 (those two variables are binary by the way). So it would be fitting to use something like sample_weight = x[,1:20] as an argument.
