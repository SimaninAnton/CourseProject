We need docstrings for every single function, class or method that is longer than 5 lines.
Every docstring should include an # Arguments section (if applicable), a # Returns section (if applicable), and a # Raises section describing every exception raised by the function (if any). Classes should also include a # Properties section for their public properties.
I've started working on this yesterday. Would anybody like to help? It's going to be a lot of work.
Thanks!
