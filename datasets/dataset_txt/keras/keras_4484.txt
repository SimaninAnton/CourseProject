I trained a relatively standard convolutional neural network with Keras using Theano with a K40m GPU. The training goes well and I'm happy with the results. I then save the network topology with model_to_json and the weights with save_weights and read it from another computer without a GPU to do some applications for the network using model.predict. The results with the CPU are completely off and different from what I should get. I run the CPU version with the environment variables device=cpu,floatX=float32 to make sure that the CPU is using 32 bits for the floating point numbers. My version of Keras is 1.0.8. Any indication of how to proceed to solve this issue?
