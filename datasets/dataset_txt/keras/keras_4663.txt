I tried training the following code on github:
https://github.com/osh/KerasGAN/blob/master/mnist_gan.py
using tensorflow backend (although the original code uses theano backend, but nothing in particular depends on theano). Training is working well: training loss and generated images are all good, and I saved the generator after training:
generator.save("test.h5")
But when I try to reload the model, for example in ipython, I got the following error:
Any ideas what's going wrong?
