Hi, following my previous message I can now confirm the bug at loading the models.
So, a minimum working example is:
from keras.models import model_from_json

with open(model_1_file_name) as f:
    model_1 = model_from_json(f.read())
with open(model_2_file_name) as f:
    model_2 = model_from_json(f.read())
Now, if someone checks the model_1.input and the model_2.input he will see that both are the same.
