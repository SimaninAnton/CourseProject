System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using example directory): Not needed(keras-examples)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow backend (yes / no): yes
TensorFlow version: 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0
Keras version: 2.2.0 -> 2.2.4
Python version: 3.6.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Gefore 1050Ti 4GB
** Problem description **
When I upgrade tensorflow-gpu from 1.10.0 to 1.11.0, it's keras requirements get upgraded. And, the new tensorflow-gpu performs much worse(60x time needed to initialize, 10x slower when training). Problem presists when I downgrade tensorflow-gpu from 1.11.0 to 1.10.0 but the problem is gone again when I downgrade keras to 2.2.0
My guess is that there are several breaking changes in keras minor updates that could affect tensorflow's performance on windows dramatically.
