I had a keras model that ran fine with keras 1, but having updated to keras 2 (and updated tensorflow) I now get an error trying to run this:
vae.compile(optimizer="adam", loss=vae_loss,metrics=["categorical_accuracy","top_k_categorical_accuracy"])
The following error shows up.
Dimension (-1) must be in the range [0, 2), where 2 is the number of dimensions in the input. for 'metrics_4/categorical_accuracy/ArgMax' (op: 'ArgMax') with input shapes: [?,?], [].
The keras release notes doesn't mention anything about arguments of the categorical_accuracy metric to have changed. What am I missing?
