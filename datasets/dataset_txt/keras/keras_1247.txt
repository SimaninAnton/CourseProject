Hi,
I wanted to use the layer Conv2Dtranspose and Conv3Dtranspose in order to do deconvolution.
I can get my model built and compiled, but the upsampling part does not seem to work, even when I modify the parameter dilate_rate.
Any idea how to do the upsampling part using ConvXDtranspose?
Or am I misunderstanding how this layer works?
