I seem to get this error when I am using the callback function modelcheckpoint..
I saw from a different issue(#5253) that, that the error could be due to a large network architecture.. Which is also my case.
But how should i then save the model, I can save the model using yaml or json but what about the weight? how can i store them if the model is too large?
