I am wondering: can I run Keras on a cluster of CPUs in parallel? Since currently I am not having GPU resources but I have CPU-cluster, I am wondering can I manage my Keras program and run it on many CPUs?
And do you have some ideas about the speed between GPU (let's say Amazon EC2 g2.2xlarge instance) and a CPU cluster (let's say 10 cpus).
I have also seen this tool elephas . There are some usage-of-data-parallel-models. I am wondering what is the data parallel meaning here?
Does it mean that during each of the epoch, the many batchs are paralleled and trained on different workers?
