I am working on reinforcement learning task and it requires calculating prediction too many times. I have found that 56,87% of cumulative time is taken by _predict_loop method. Also I have found that installing CUDA and enabling GPU calculation doesn't help.
Is there any configuration tricks that can help here? If this is something that will require updating keras code - I am happy to help.
