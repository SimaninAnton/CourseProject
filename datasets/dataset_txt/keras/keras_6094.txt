The fit function of my graph model is:
model.fit({'input': X_train, 'output': y_train},
          batch_size=batch_size,
          nb_epoch=nb_epoch,
         validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
I got an error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "imdb_cnn.py", line 79, in <module>
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/keras/models.py", line 1129, in fit
    y_val = [standardize_y(validation_data[name]) for name in self.output_order]
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/keras/models.py", line 1129, in <listcomp>
    y_val = [standardize_y(validation_data[name]) for name in self.output_order]
TypeError: tuple indices must be integers, not str
Could someone tell me where is the problem?
By the way, I also noticed that show_accuracy argument is not supported in Graph. Will it be added?
