Is there any way to import Keras without Theano if using a Tensorflow backend? I ask this because with the new Google Cloud ML, you can train models in the cloud, but the cloud instance needs to download Keras before it can begin training, and I notice that a lot of the time spent downloading Keras is actually downloading Theano. If there was some way to only download the parts of Keras relevant to Tensorflow, that would be ideal.
