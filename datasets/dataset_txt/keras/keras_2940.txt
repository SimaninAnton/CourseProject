Hello there,
I am using Keras (version 2.0.1) with the latest Tensorflow (installed from pip) as a backend. This is one of my first attempts to use Keras but I get the following error when I try to fit the training data into my model:
ValueError: None values not supported.
which is thrown from within Tensorflow.
I run MacOS Sierra on a Macbook Pro, but I haven't tried to reproduce the problem on other machines.
Here is an Jupyter notebook with the code which reproduces the problem (with example preprocessed data):
https://gist.github.com/ant0nisk/f5ee88af693b37d93d4d6adb572e6f98
I checked my data, and it doesn't have any None values, however I am still new to this, so I am not sure what exactly causes this exception.
Anyone else has this problem?
