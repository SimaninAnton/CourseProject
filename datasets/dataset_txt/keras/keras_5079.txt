I have a dataset about Travel ( ~800000 row). A small data set is below:
user_id | loc_id | num_checkin
1000003 | 168913 | 2
1000003 | 29488 | 1
1000003 | 9310 | 2
1000007 | 11138 | 1
1000007 | 11195 | 1
user_id : id of traveler;
loc_id : id of location;
num_checkin: times visit
Now, I need to implement a system to recommend location for traveler, that i want to try with Deep learning in Keras. Do you any idea about that. Please help!
