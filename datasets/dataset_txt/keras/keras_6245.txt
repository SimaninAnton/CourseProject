The following code is from https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L551.
I don't understand why we need reshape here. And it will cause exception. Anyone tested this?
        output = T.batched_tensordot(l1, l2, self.dot_axes)
        output_shape = list(self.output_shape)
        output_shape[0] = l1.shape[0]
        output = output.reshape(tuple(output_shape))
        return output
