I guess this more of a feature request, but I'm trying to render some visualizations of my model weights from the h5 files and I'm having a hard time figuring out which parameters are which. I have no idea if this would break anything but it seems like giving parameters names in addition to being able to name layers would be fairly straightforward and might be a big help to some people.
