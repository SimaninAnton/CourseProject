System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using example directory):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow backend yes
TensorFlow version: ''v1.13.1-0-g6612da8951' 1.13.1
Keras version: 2.2.4
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 10.0
GPU model and memory: 4 GB
i was tried continues training in keras.
because i was build keras multiclass classification model, after i have new labels, and values. so i want to build new model without retraining. that is why i tried continuous train in keras.
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='sigmoid'))

    model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    
    model.fit(training_data, labels, epochs=20, batch_size=1)

    model.save("keras_model.h5")
after completing save the model , i want to do continues training. so i tried,
    model1 = load_model("keras_model.h5")
    model1.fit(new_input, new_label, epochs=20, batch_size=1)
    model1.save("keras_model.h5")
i tried this. but it was thrown error.like previously 10 classes.
but now we add new class means error occurred.
so what is my question is, is it possible for continues training in keras for multiclass classification for new class?
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Received a label value of 10 which is outside the valid range of [0, 9).  Label values: 10

Thank you :)
