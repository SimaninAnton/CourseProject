Someone has a theano port of the layer that was custom implemented for Ross Girschick's fast/faster RCNN models: https://github.com/ddtm/theano-roi-pooling
I thought I'd leave this here in case someone wants to pick that up and run with it to integrate it into Keras. I can't work on it myself until June at the earliest.
