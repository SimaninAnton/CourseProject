The current item ("Sequential" and all sub-items in the figure) should be indented by one more tab. The current display is rather confusing.
I played with the CSS for a little bit but couldn't fix it easily.
How to reproduce: Open the page https://keras.io/models/sequential/ in Chrome, Firefox, or IE.
