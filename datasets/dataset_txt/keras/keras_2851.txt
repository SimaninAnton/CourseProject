I'm now migrating to keras2 and I find the documentation and hints regarding keras.layers.merge unclear:
The hint says "Use instead layers from keras.layers.merge, e.g. add, concatenate, etc.", however the layers actually have their names capitalized, perhaps the hint is meant to use capitalized initials or say "functions" instead of "layers".
My naive attempt to use the functional interface was
import keras.layers.merge as m  # or even better, "...as merge"
features = m.concatenate(feature_list, name='merged_features', axis=channel_axis)
but I get the error AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'concatenate'. I think the issue is that this imports the legacy merge wrapper. I don't know if this has a good solution but it'd be great to be more verbose about this in the new documentation, and I think many people will not be excited about importing non-namespaced globals like "add", "dot" or "maximum".
