I have a five dimentions series vector. I want to use Convolution1D to get series characters
but I have some problems. I couldn't understand the difference about input_dim and input _length in Convoltion1D.
coding:
`
training set
x_test=np.random.random_sample((100,5))
y_test=np.random.randint(2,size=100)
model
model= Sequential()
model.add(Convolution1D(nb_filter=1,filter_length=2,input_dim=5))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_test,y_test)
`
but it is wrong, It says I don't input parameter 'input_length'
So I change the code
code is following:
training set
x_test=np.random.random_sample((100,5))
y_test=np.random.randint(2,size=100)
model
model= Sequential()
model.add(Convolution1D(nb_filter=1,filter_length=2,input_dim=5,input_dim=5))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_test,y_test)
`
However, it is still wrong, It says my input-dimensions is wrong?
anyone know it?
