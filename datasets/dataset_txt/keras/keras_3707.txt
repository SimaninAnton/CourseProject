I am a newbie in Keras. My topmost layer is a (n,1) vector, and I am trying to get all of its 2-way interactions. I attempt to do so by multiplying the layer by its transpose using a Lambda layer:
Lambda(lambda x: K.(dot(K.transpose(x), x)), output_shape =(n, n))
Unfortunately, this doesn't work because at runtime (surprisingly?) it seems that the first dimension of my layer are the datapoints.
I am working with a Sequential model, but I would be happy to change to a functional model if that helps. I can send more code if it's helpful.
Thank you for your patience and help.
