I noticed that the data_format is still hard coded in the Tensorflow backend to convolution2d (conv2d). I read an issue that stated it was to unstable about a year ago and that is why it wasn't being supported as of that time, but now I think it has been tested enough since then and it may qualify looking into officially supporting it.
I made the modification to my local version of Keras and notice a good throughput improvement on CPUs.
Can enabling this functionality be revisited?
