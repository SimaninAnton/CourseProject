Hello,
I am training a neural network with fit generator because of the large dataset I am using. This dataset consist of 56000 samples and has got 60 classes. The line that I use to train is the following one:
history=model.fit_generator(generate_training_from_file(samplesTrain,batch_size),validation_data=generate_test_from_file(samplesTest,batch_size),steps_per_epoch=np.floor(len(samplesTrain)/batch_size), validation_steps=np.floor(len(samplesTest)/batch_size),callbacks=callbacks_list, epochs=50,verbose=1)
I have checked that my generators, generate_training_from_file and generate_test_from_file, are working well.
When very few samples are passed to the network, this one begin to learn very quickly and the training accuracy reaches 1. However, my validation accuaracy is 0.
I don't know if I have any mistake in above line or you think that the problem can be in another place.
Could you help me?
Thank so much.
