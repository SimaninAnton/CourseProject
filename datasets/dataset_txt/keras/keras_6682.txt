Taking imdb_cnn as an example, classification accuracy using maxent outperforms that using cnn. Why do we use CNN for texts classification. What the advantages CNN have? In fact, I have used many suitable parameters and add another convolution layer according to my comprehension. I don't know if I didn't adjust the suitable parameters.
Expect someone who has used two methods to tell me how to handle this problem. After all, deep learning is the tendency in CS.
