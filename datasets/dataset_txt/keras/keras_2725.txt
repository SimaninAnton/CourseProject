Hi,
Suppose that someone builds a model. Then he will compile it with a loss L_1 and a optimizer Opt_1. If, at a later point and after some training, he re-compiles the model with optimizer Opt_2, what will be the effect on the model?
Will the weights re-initialized? Or the initialization in the build method will be kept and, thus, the weights will be the ones calculated by the Opt_1 optimizer?
