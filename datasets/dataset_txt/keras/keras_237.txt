Description
In Variational Autoencoders (VAE) there is an encoding layer that is composed of the standard deviation and mean of the inputs in the coding space.
I looked through the documentation and couldn't find any pre-exisitng Keras layers that implemented this functionality found in standard VAEs.
I also couldn't find any issues that currently ask about this (though if there is, I apologize).
Ask
Is this feature being actively worked on? Or is the need so low that it isn't something included in the roadmap?
Reason being is that I am writing my own Keras layer class to implement this functionality, and I wanted to know if I could open a pull request for this to be included in the Keras library if it does not exist.
TL;DR I want to make a pull request for Encoding Layers found in VAEs, but don't know if its already been done or currently worked on.
