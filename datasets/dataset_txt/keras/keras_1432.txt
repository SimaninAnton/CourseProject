While using keras' flow_from_directory to load a dataset (using ImageDatagenerator), I encounter some error while calling the method fit_generator. This is because there is/are some image(s) file(s) that is/are corrupt in my data directory.
How can I check what image is corrupted or how can I tell flow_from_directory or fit_generator to drop examples that raise and exception?
