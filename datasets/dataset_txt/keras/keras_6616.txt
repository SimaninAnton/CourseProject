Fchollet and contributors -- Thank you so much for what you have put together. Keras has significantly helped me.
Recently, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks have been of deep interest to me. I see however, that Keras does not support these.
I know there are resources out there (http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/DBN.html) for DBN's in Theano. However, it would be a absolute dream if Keras could do these.
I know this is all open-source, but I would even be willing to pay someone to help develop DBN's on Keras so we can all use it. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all use them, and if we could use them, I think our deep learning abilities would be expanded.
Thoughts on this?
