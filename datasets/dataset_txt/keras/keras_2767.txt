Hi, i am using ModelCheckpoint callback to monitor 'val_acc' and I get this error
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1485, in fit
initial_epoch=initial_epoch)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1160, in _fit_loop
callbacks.on_epoch_end(epoch, epoch_logs)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/callbacks.py", line 75, in on_epoch_end
callback.on_epoch_end(epoch, logs)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/keras/callbacks.py", line 383, in on_epoch_end
filepath = self.filepath.format(epoch=epoch, **logs)
KeyError: 'val_acc'
Looked at Keras codebase but could not debug it, why is this error coming?
