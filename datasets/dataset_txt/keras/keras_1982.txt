Hi,
I have a question about Bidirectional LSTM implemented in Keras.
I have shared Bidirectional LSTM
`shared_lstm=Bidirectional(LSTM(50,return_sequences=True),merge_mode='concat')
a=shared_lstm(emb_1)
b=shared_lstm(emb_2)
pool_vec_1=Flatten() (MaxPooling1D(pool_size=max_length)(a))
pool_vec_1 =Flatten() (MaxPooling1D(pool_size=max_length)(b))`
and I would like later to use my pre-trained weights
lstm = shared_lstm.get_weights()[0] lstm=Bidirectional(LSTM(50),merge_mode='sum', weights=[lstm],trainable = False)
My problem is : shared_lstm has 6 outputs. Which shoul I use?
