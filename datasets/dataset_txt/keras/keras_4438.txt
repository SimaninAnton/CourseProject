It is often useful to have a second copy of the model being trained that maintains an exponential moving average of the model weights. This can results in improved performance on validation/test set and is already available in Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/train.html#ExponentialMovingAverage
and can be a useful feature for training with Keras.
see 'Model Ensembles" section here for an intuitive description: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/
I implemented this for my Keras experiments using callback function:

Feedback is highly welcomed. I can later on submit a pull request for this if it turns out that implementing it as a callback function is a good enough solution.
