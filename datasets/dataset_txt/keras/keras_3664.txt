This is a request for an implementation of learning to learn (L2L) as a keras optimizer option published by google deepmind.
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474
TensorFlow implementation: https://github.com/deepmind/learning-to-learn
This may require some design modifications to work with something like the following from the cifar10_cnn.py example:
# Let's train the model using RMSprop
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='rmsprop',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
That is because the MetaOptimizer has to be tuned for the specific problem.
