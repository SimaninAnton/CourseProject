Hiiiiii........
First of all, I want to let you know I have installed anaconda, theano, keras, cuda and it works. so charming.
But after the new gpu appears, I change the configuration according to the tutorial. And it did not work.
I have reinstalled, and no longer work like before. Three days I've been following most of comments on stackoverflow and github, but it still does not work
Is anyone willing to help me just by making a tutorial with NEW GPU?
Please, i need help u
