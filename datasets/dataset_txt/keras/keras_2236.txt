I have searched high and low but found no satisfying results...
So, here is the problem:
The neural network outputs a (4,) array, and the predicted labels should be those greater than 0.5.
The problem is, top_k_categorical_accuracy won't work.(of course)
And, when I tried to implement one by my own,
I noticed that:
def customized_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
the parameter y_true and y_pred are tensors. And what I tried to do is in-place assignment, making those values greater than 0.5 become 1 and others 0.
Any ideas?
