I found one small bug for function 'add_ngram' in the file examples/imdb_fasttext.py. When adding n grams, the grams with size of 1, 2,..., n-1 should be all added according to the original paper. However, this function cannot fully achieve this goal due to these two lines: "for i in range(len(new_list) - ngram_range + 1):"; "for ngram_value in range(2, ngram_range + 1):". I think the positions of the two lines should be swapped so that it looks like this: "for ngram_value in range(2, ngram_range + 1): for i in range(len(new_list) - ngram_value + 1):". Please check on this issue to make updates. Thank you!
