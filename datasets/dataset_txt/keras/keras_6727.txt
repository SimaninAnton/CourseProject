An issue with using the shared scalars for lr and momentum -- now the to_json and to_yaml methods don't work, as they don't know how to handle theano types directly. I've simply been pickling the dict from the get_config method, but I have a project where I need to actually sent the network structure as a PUT request. Before I draw up a PR, do you have a preferred way of handing this?
