Subsampling: Keras 1: What is the subsampling in the Convolution2D doing?
One of the Arguments of Convolution2D-layer:
"subsample: tuple of length 2. Factor by which to subsample output. Also called strides elsewhere."
Is it a "Stride" so the convolutional-kernel is filters only every 2nd pixel or so?
Or is it a form of pooling? If so: What kind of pooling is it exactly?
MaxPooling?
AveragePooling?
Or does this subsampling, downsample the feature map created by the convolution? So not exactly a pooling, but using only every 2nd pixel of the feature map?
It is a very specific question and I could not get a clear answer online. Most people seem not to know the exact difference.
