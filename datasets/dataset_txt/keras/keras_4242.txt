For some reason, the cifar-10 example is not converging when image_dim_ordering is set to tf. I have tried both with theano and with tensorflow – neither version works. When I switch image_dim_ordering to th all works as expected.
I have checked the data and it seems it gets loaded correctly – is it perhaps some quirk of the model or a bug in one of the layers' implementation?
