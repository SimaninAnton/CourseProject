Hello,
I was trying to make a model with multi-inputs and outputs:
model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs= [output_a, output_b]) model.fit_generator(data_generator(True, batch_size=batch_size), steps_per_epoch=train_steps, epochs=20)
^ data_generator returns two inputs and a target ( [X1, X2], y)
and I got this error:
ValueError: The model expects 2 input arrays, but only received one array. Found: array with shape (32, 1).
It was confusing as I was passing two input_arrays. It turned out that I had to pass two targets for two outputs, which was not clear from the error. Is this the intended behavior or should it be addressed?
Thanks
