In the old keras 1.x there was a callback called TerminateOnNan. I used this frequently, it is gone in the update to 2.0.
But the old code works without changes, I could just import the Callback class and paste the old code for TerminateOnNan. It works as expected.
Could you add this to keras/callbacks.py again ?
