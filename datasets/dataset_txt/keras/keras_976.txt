Hi, I'm currently thinking about using keras to implement the spectral normalization for GANs. I'm thinking to use the kernel_constraint, but it seems like only several available built-in functions can be used as kernel_constraint. Can I use my own functions as constraints?
Can someone give some ideas or instructions about this?
