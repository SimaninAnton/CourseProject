Is there any changelog or releasenote for Keras?
Some projects claims they requires Keras>1.0.7 some requires >1.1 but if I use 1.2.1, some broken because of API change, e.g. CallbackList._set_model disappeared.
Building a awesome library like Keras might provide a changelog or release note and some backward compatibility docs, then the ecosystem might be integrated better.
Thanks. You guys doing a great job.
