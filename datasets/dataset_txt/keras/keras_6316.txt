Now that we've completed the switch to a modular backend, here's an update on where we want to go in the near future.
Priorities: code quality and documentation.
better, faster unit tests with higher coverage.
comprehensive docstrings everywhere. Switch to autogenerated, versioned documentation.
strict enforcement of user input assumptions, and raising of helpful error messages.
Secondary goals:
layer output memoization.
Graph API improvements.
Caffe model support. There is a PR outstanding, it needs to be reviewed. Also it seems to be lacking any form of tests. Anyone interested?
