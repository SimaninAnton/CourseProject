Hi,
My application is similar to cifar100. I am working on multi-label classification and I have many such labels in an image.
For example, lets say I have an image with two cars and a ship. I want to get an output that the image has a car and ship.Also, I want to classify it saying that it has two cars and a ship.
To explain it further, I will give the sample of my label file.
Lets suppose my images have car, bike, truck, aeroplane and ships.
In multi-label classification, my label file would be of the form:
image_name [-1 1 -1 1 1] {1 is class present, -1 is class absent}
I am making an assumption that each image has atmost 3 components. So my label file for an image with 2 cars and ship would be:
image_name [[-1 1 -1 -1 -1], [-1 1 -1 -1 -1],[-1 -1 -1 1 -1]]
How to load these data in keras ?? Is there any example code to upload the labels and the images separately???
