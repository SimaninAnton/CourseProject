Hi,
I want to implement a neural network with two loss function as in [http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf]
How can I implement this in Keras?
Do I have to split my last dense layer and call a loss function layer for each output?
Or do I have to create my own custom layer which has to compute both softmax and center loss ?
Regards
Sebastien
