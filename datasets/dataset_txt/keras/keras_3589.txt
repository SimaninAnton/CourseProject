Hi! I'm new to keras, I have one confuse regarding the learning rate decay schedule of keras implementation, it seems that keras only implement the 1/t decay schedule, but as proposed inhttp://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#anneal, step decay is much more preferable, so I'm confused that why keras didn't implement other decay schedule method, and in practice, for example, I'm going to train a network, how to set the decay prameter?
