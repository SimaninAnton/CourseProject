Hi! I am working on transferring NASNet Mobile weights from Keras to Pytorch.
After transferring the weights and making predictions of the same image using both frameworks I am getting absolutely the same values both in confidence and in any middle layers of the network.
However, the evaluation of the imagenet using transferred weights in Pytorch gave me
Acc@1 38.110 Acc@5 60.844
Also, I tested the script that I am using for evaluation on ImageNet and it works correct, as I got correct values for other architectures.
I was wondering if you could double check the weight that you provide for NASNet Mobile, probably there is some issue with them!
