I try to run sequential with Keras; I found that the thread running sequential model generated about 13 sub-threads. How to control the number of sub-threads?
part of my code:
model = Sequential()
model.add(...)
.....
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=params['optimizer'])
model.fit(.....)
Please help me with this problem. Thanks in advance!
