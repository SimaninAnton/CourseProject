Hi, I think there is a bug in Deconvolution2D.
I run the example code in the tutorial,
model = Sequential()
model.add(Deconvolution2D(3, 3, 3, output_shape=(None, 3, 14, 14), border_mode='valid', input_shape=(3, 12, 12)))
The output shape is equal to (3, 14, 14). according to the formula,
s (i - 1) + a + k - 2p = 1 (12 - 1) + 0 + 3 - 0 = 14 (s = stride, i = input size, a = user -defined, p = padding)
However, If I add padding layer,
model = Sequential()
model.add(ZeroPadding2D((1,1), input_shape=(3, 12, 12)))
model.add(Deconvolution2D(3, 3, 3, output_shape=(None, 3, 14, 14))
The output shape should s (i - 1) + a + k - 2p = 1 (14 - 1) + 0 + 3 - 2 = 14
However, keras produces an error, "ValueError: impossible convolution output dim: expected 32x3x12x12 but received gradient with shape 32x3x14x14"
I think that Deconvolution2D does not count pad for calculating output shape.
Do you what happens?
The error can be resolved if I use moder_mode = 'full', and I don't understand this one too.
Thanks,
