Convolution1D behaves differently from Convolution2D, e.g. the output shape are inconsistent. Shouldn't these two layers be equivalent for the following example?
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Convolution1D, Convolution2D

model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution2D(32, 1, 3, input_shape=(1, 1, 128)))
print(model.output_shape)  # -> (None, 32, 1, 126)

model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution1D(32, 3, input_shape=(1, 128)))
print(model.output_shape)  # -> (None, -1, 32) instead of (None, 32, 126), which I would expect
Is this a bug or is there a reason for this that I don't understand?
