Hi guys,
I am using Keras 2.0.2 with TensorFlow backend. I have read the previous issues in Keras giving different results at every run. So I set my Numpy seed initially like this :
    np.random.seed(1337)
    import tensorflow as tf
    tf.set_random_seed(1337)
I want to run an LSTM layer so I also initialized all the initializers to a fixed seed like this :
 lstm = LSTM(300,activation='tanh', recurrent_activation='sigmoid', recurrent_initializer=keras.initializers.RandomNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.05, seed=33), bias_initializer=keras.initializers.RandomNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.05, seed=33), kernel_initializer=keras.initializers.RandomNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.05, seed=33))(Embeddings)
I have also set " shuffle = False " while fitting the model so that the input does not get shuffled and set the number of epochs to be 1. When I check the LSTM weights, I get two different weights for two different runs. Could you please let me know how to solve this issue?
Thanks in advance.
