ValueError Traceback (most recent call last)
Error when checking input: expected conv2d_17_input to have shape (None, 1, 1876, 1) but got array with shape (30, 1, 1867, 1)
the shape of x_train is (30,1,1867,1) and input_shape = (1,1867,1) , matched quite well and the other dimension is batch_size. it should be (batch_size, 1, 1867 , 1) . however it doesn't work .so what's the problem with it ?
