I think it would be useful to have a predict_generator method, which accepts a generator as a first argument just like the existing *_generator methods.
Example use case:
I want to do custom evaluation after training (e.g. computing F1 score) and my evaluation data is too large to fit into a single array.
While it is not too complicated to write my own utility method for this, I believe having this in keras would have advantages as there is already some infrastructure for generators in the code base (e.g. background queue) and it would complement the other _generator methods nicely.
