Hello,
i am using 1.2.0.. I am trying to parallelize a model by splitting the batches. In my examples an error is raised when using any sort of regularizer. The same happenes, when a regularization layer is used. Is this error replicable for you and what can i do to fix that?
This is one example training vgg16 on cifar10.
In this example an error is caused by line 106
model.add(Convolution2D(64, (3, 3), kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.00004), ################## causes the error activation='relu'))
when trying to parallelize the model by slicing the batches and copying the model using the make_parallel function adapted from kuza55/multi_gpu
The error tells
AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute '_losses'
