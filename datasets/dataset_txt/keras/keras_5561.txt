Currently, I'm trying to use Graph Model for my experiment.
So, firstly, I just rewrite the code in /keras/example/mnist_cnn.py, and replace the Sequential Model with Graph Model
in mnist dataset, the X_train has 50000 samples, and the batch size is set 128, the program goes well until it gets the 49920th sample(which is exactly 390 batches), the batch-left data has 80 samples, which is not the same as batch size(128), and the program stopped, gives me an error.
I change the batch size to 100, it will perform well.
I set the batch size to 128, and use SequencialModel, it also goes well.
So, I'm not sure whether the Graph Model can deal with the batch-left data? If it supports, how can I use it?
