according to the tensorflow documentation, it seems y_preds are assumed to come from softmax when from_logits=False, yet how about keras? there is no such a parameter from_logits in keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy()
And also, if it's assumed to come from softmax, isn't the name categorical_crossentropy misleading since it sounds like combined softmax and CE ?
