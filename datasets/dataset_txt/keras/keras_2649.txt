Hello everyone：
I am a newer to keras. I want to use keras classify the image. There are some problem. I have two kinds of inputs which are paired but have different size，so I want to use the functional model. But I wonder if the two different inputs will be not paired after shuffle. And any one have an idea to deal with the problem?
Thank you!
