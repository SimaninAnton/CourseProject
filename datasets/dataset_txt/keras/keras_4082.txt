is there any function available for building stacked auto-encoder in keras library? If no, does some offer some ideas for that. Actually I also have an idea, but I think it is a very naive idea. My idea is that each time train two layer (encode and decode) then freeze them. And add new layers (both decode and encoder) train them. And repeating above processes until reaching the full model.
