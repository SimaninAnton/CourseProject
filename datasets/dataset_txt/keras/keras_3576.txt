I have just updated my TensorFlow to version r0.12
It looks like they are no longer supporting 'batch_matmul' operation
Specific error:
File "/home/itay/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py", line 871, in batch_dot
out = tf.batch_matmul(x, y, adj_a=adj_x, adj_b=adj_y)
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'batch_matmul'
What can I do to solve this?
