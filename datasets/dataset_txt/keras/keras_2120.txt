Let suppose I have a keras model and a function train_model(data) to train it on some data and save the it.
I would like to know if it is possible to combine/merge identical architecture models that have been trained separately/independently?
 python train_model( data1 )
 python train_model( data2 )
 ...
then
 load( model1 )
 load( model2 )
 merge( model1, model2 )
If it is not, is there a way to distribute the learning in a way to make it faster?
