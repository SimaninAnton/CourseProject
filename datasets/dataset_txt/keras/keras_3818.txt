I am using Keras with Tensorflow backend for implementing a convolutional autoencoder. I keep getting shape related errors when I try to use validation_split in the fit function with Deconvolution2D layer. If I do not provide validation_split to fit() and explicitly provide the batch_size in the output_shape of Deconvolution2D, everything works fine. In this case, I have to explicitly provide the validation_data to fit(). However, using validation_split is a more elegant choice and it would be great to have it working with Deconvolution2D also.
