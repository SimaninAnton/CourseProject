When saving a model using the keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint I've encountered a missing dependency. I assume the same is true for a direct call to model.save(...).
Since this is a direct (or indirect) dependency is it worth adding to Keras' dependencies? I'm new to the code base and couldn't find where you are tracking them. If somebody points me to the location, I'm happy to submit a PR.
If it isn't worth tracking, could we instead update the docks to very clearly state that this is a dependency? I can see somebody careless (like me xD) running an expensive model only to find it crashing after 1 hour, because they try to save it.
