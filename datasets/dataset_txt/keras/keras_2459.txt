In the image processing module: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L330
img.resize has the aspect ratio issue, see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273946/how-do-i-resize-an-image-using-pil-and-maintain-its-aspect-ratio
It would be great if img.thumbnail is used. Or it would be better if both option is supported
Thank you!
