I am new to CNN and have been trying to use it for the document classification in Keras.
My dataset has 1500 documents which comprises of 20 paragraphs, which consists of 50 sentences each and each sentence consists of 15 words (200 dimension word embeddings). So each instance is in 4D (20 paragraph, 50 sentence,15 words,200 wordvector).
My query is "which convolution filter (1D, 2D or 3D) would work in my case? A possible explanation is welcome. A tutorial or links would also be appreciated.
To begin with I don't want to use sentence/paragraph embeddings for now.
