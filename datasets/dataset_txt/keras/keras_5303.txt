Hi,
I'm new to Keras and currently evaluating the library for my research purpose. Could someone clarify if Keras supports error backpropagation to train a neural network built using DenseLayers? I could not find any references in the documentation. I'm working on a multi-class classification problem and the objective function is 'categorical_crossentropy'.
