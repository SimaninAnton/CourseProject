I know the functional API supports declaring input shape in an Input layer, and then passing that to a Model() object, but what's the equivalent for Sequential()? I'd expect something like this to work:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Input(batch_shape=(batch_size, height, width, channels)))
model.add(Convolutions/RNNs/Dense/Whatever)
model.compile(...)
but it doesn't.
AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute 'inbound_nodes'
What am I missing? Shouldn't the API's work similarly?
I'd even expect something like (my preferred API, because all models always have at least one input, right?):
model = Sequential((batch_size, height, width, channels))
model.add(Convolutions/RNNs/Dense/Whatever)
model.compile(...)
Also, why is it called batch_input_shape in some layers, and batch_shape in others? It's a bit confusing, honestly.
