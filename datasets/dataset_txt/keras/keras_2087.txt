Using keras 2 this works fine:
from keras.models import Sequential
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(4096, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,3,3)))
model.summary()
However when I try to inherit from Sequential it fails with "AttributeError: 'Sequential2' object has no attribute 'nodes_by_depth'":
class Sequential2(Sequential):
    pass
model2 = Sequential2()
model2.add(Dense(4096, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,3,3)))
model2.summary()
I note that Sequential.init does not call the parent init. However if that were the problem I am not sure why the first version works. I note also that if I insert a self.build() after the add then it seems to work though not sure if that just causes other problems.
