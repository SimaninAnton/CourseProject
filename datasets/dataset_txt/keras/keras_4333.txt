I want to visualize the hidden layer of my pre-trained autoencoder like https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html do, but I find that the amplitude of result will increase without stop, because there is no normalization for the input.
So, how can I add a BatchNormalization layer before my pre-trained autoencoder?
