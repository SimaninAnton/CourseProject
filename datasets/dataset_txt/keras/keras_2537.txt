When using Sequential, the 1st layer must be provided with input_shape, which is reasonable if that is all about your model, but it is not necessary (and not always known) when used as a Layer in a bigger model (for the purpose of hiding lower level details and readability when using summary). Can we actually made the input_shape of the 1st layer optional, i.e., by checking if is called as a Layer or not?
