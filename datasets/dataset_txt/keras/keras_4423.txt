Hi, I would like to build a model like following to preprocess 2 datasets before feed into my model:
model = Sequential()
model.add(AveragePooling1D(input_shape=(2,2)))
model.compile()
How could do the preprocessing and get the result, should I use model.train(input_data) or model.predict(input_data)?
