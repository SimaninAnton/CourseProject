Dear moderators,
Are there any particular reasons skipgram was removed from latest release? I have built upon Skipgram to code cbow, WSABIE, and various other word2vec style embedding which I tested to be of equivalent quality (qualitatively) as that of gensim. if there was no particular reason for Skipgram removal, I would like to contribute the codes to Keras.
Regards,
SK
