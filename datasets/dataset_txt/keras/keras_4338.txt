model.add(LSTM(4, input_dim=look_back)) // 4 LSTM blocks
But how many cells it has in keras?
for example i assume 4 memory blocks and 2 cells. Is there any architecture?
In stacked LSTM
model.add(LSTM(4, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(4, return_sequences=False))
for example i assume 4 memory blocks and 2 cells. How it looks like architecture?
in that case, will have 2 hidden layer, hidden layer i have 4 lstm blocks (layer1) these feedback to another lstm layer which has same 4 lstm blocks. Am i right?
