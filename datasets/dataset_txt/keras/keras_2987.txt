I have been following the instruction for setting up keras on GPU . This is what I did as suggested by method 3
import theano
theano.config.device = 'gpu'
theano.config.floatX = 'float32'
However, I get the following error message
Using Theano backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "train.py", line 17, in
theano.config.device = 'gpu'
File "/devl/geophys/dplearn/tensorflow/tf_0.12/lib/python3.4/site-packages/theano/configparser.py", line 338, in set

Exception: Can't change the value of this config parameter after initialization!
