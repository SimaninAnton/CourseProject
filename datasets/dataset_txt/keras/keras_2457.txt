Hi guys,
I have developed a numpy function for custom reshaping required to convert a block of 3x3 pixel into a timestep to feed into an LSTM.
This function is working correctly on numpy arrays.
Now I want to make my network end to end trainable. For that, I will have to write this layer as keras layer. Can I use the numpy function which I wrote directly?
Or will I have to write it using theano ( My backend)?
