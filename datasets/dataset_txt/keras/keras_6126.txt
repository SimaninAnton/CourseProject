Hello,
I recently tried to run Keras imdb_cnn.py example (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_cnn.py):
I have noticed that it returns the following error message:
AttributeError: module 'theano.tensor.nnet' has no attribute 'relu'
I solved this error by defining my RELU function like this and by calling it when needed:
import theano.tensor as T

def my_relu(x):
    return T.switch(x<0, 0, x)
That problem has been solved, but now it returns a new error message:
TypeError: max_pool_2d() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'
I am using Keras 0.3.1 with Theano 0.7.0.
Could you help me with this problem?
Thank you!
