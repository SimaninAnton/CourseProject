I really cannot find a way to input sparse tensor with more than 2-d (in batch). In scipy.sparse there are really only implementations for sparse matrix but not sparse tensor (using scipy.sparse is also not mentioned in the document, ). I think this needs an improvement to allow rank > 2 input sparse tensors.
I am constructing a graph network, where I need to deal with sparse adjacent matrices. To train in batch, I need to feed adjacent matrices with the shape of (sample, n, n), so it is really necessary for this kind of jobs to allow rank > 2 sparse tensors as input.
