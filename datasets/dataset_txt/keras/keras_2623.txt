Hello,
The implementation of the HDF5Matrix class does not support inferred slices (e.g. data[:10]) as the code expects both key.start and key.stop to be integers.
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/utils/io_utils.py
Here is tiny modification to the if statement to support the said operation.
https://github.com/siryog90/keras/blob/inferred_HDF5_slices/keras/utils/io_utils.py
This is a small issue, but it can get annoying when inferring the end index (e.g. data[10:]), as I have to check the shape of the data set each time.
May I request a pull?
