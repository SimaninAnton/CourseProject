Is it possible to incorporate the output from a discriminator function in Keras?
For example is it at all possible to create something to this effect?
def adversarial_loss(y_true, y_pred): return K.log(1-discriminator.predict(y_pred))
where 'discriminator' refers to a model that takes in y_pred and returns a 0 to 1 value.
It appears there have been Tensorflow implementations which combine contextual and perceptual loss:

Any help is greatly appreciated.
