So I build neural network with input_shape (255, 255, 3). I want to have my output as (255, 255, 1). In my fit_generator I return inputs and labels with shapes (64, 255, 255, 3) and (64, 255, 255, 1) simultaneously. And when I start to train my neural network, it throws an error:
ValueError: Error when checking model target: expected conv2d_16 to have shape (None, 225, 225, 1) but got array with shape (64, 255, 255, 1)
What should I do to resolve this problem?
