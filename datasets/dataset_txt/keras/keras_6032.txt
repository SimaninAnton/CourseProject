Wouldn't it make more sense, rather than having specific concat_axis and dot_axes parameters, to have a general axis specification of what shapes should merge operate on? The semantics might be tricky for dot_axes, but for concat_axis, I don't see why that needs to be specific for concat.
For example, right now I'd need a model that could produce a time series by summing up two other time series timepoint-wise, and I see no easy way to do that - I'd like something like merge_mode='sum', merge_axis=1. I hope I'll figure out how to do that using LambdaMerge but it seems a bit scary for such a simple operation...
