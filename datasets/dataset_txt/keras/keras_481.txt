Hi, I create a autoencoder model with Keras, everything goes fine for training and prediction, but when I save the model then load it I can't retrain it, I get the following error :
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'input1' with dtype float and shape [?,3506,132]
[[Node: input1 = Placeholderdtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[?,3506,132], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0"]]
[[Node: loss_2/mul/_583 = _Recvclient_terminated=false, recv_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0", send_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0", send_device_incarnation=1, tensor_name="edge_6463_loss_2/mul", tensor_type=DT_FLOAT, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"]]
The model.fit(..) method throws the previous error.
Any suggestion ? Thanks !
Edit : FIXED !
If you're using a loss function that depends on internal layers, you should feed them to that loss function.
