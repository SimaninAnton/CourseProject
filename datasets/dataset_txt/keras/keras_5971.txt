So I've been trying to work with the fit_generator method for the graph model.
All works well if I set nb_worker=1, but any value higher than that and it just crashes.
It seems thread.start automatically triggers _stop.is_set() after the first thread. This is in python3. Haven't tested python2.7
I lack the skills for any more informative debugging >.>
