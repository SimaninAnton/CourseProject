Hi guys,
I've 2 conceptual questions about keras. Hope is not a problem to ask them in the same time (since they are related).
First: In many examples and also there are some questions about keras reproducibility of results, appears the motivation to fix a seed before one imports anything related to keras. I know keras randomly sets the events for each batch during the fit and that if not fixed could lead to different results in the end of training even using the same configuration in different runs. So, could some one explain what exactly happens when we fix the seed? Is there any other stochastic process that is affected by fixing the seed? I looked in keras documentation and the questions already asked here but I didn't find a clear detailing for that.
Second: These variations we observed in the final models, when not fixing the seed, can be used as an estimation of the uncertainty of the keras (for a particular application)?
Thanks in advance!
And I'm sorry if I should have asked the questions separately.
