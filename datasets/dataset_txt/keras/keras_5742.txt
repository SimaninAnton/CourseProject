In the CNN example for the minst dataset:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py
they tell you how to make a good CNN network to recognise hand written digits.
The issue is that it doesn't tell you how to predict new digits.
For example give an image, if I do this:
model.predict(image)
instead of telling me what digits it think it is, it instead gives me a list of 10 numbers (presumably probabilities)
Please help!
