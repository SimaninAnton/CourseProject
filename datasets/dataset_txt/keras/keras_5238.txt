Hi, I'm trying keras for analyzing text sentiment based on examples/imdb_lstm.py .
I trained model and saved in file
json_string = model.to_json() open('lstm_model.json', 'w').write(json_string) model.save_weights('lstm_weights.h5')
Now I want to feed new text to model to get sentiment of text. But how?
I'm not able to convert string text to word_index.. I tried preprocessing.text.Tokenizer but I need word index dictionary which I don't see to be available for IMDB dataset. Am I missing something? Thank you very much..
