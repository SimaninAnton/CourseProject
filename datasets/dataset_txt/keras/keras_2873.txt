When adding a constant tensor create by tf.zeros()
a = tf.zeros([batch_size]+list(input_shape))
b = ...(output of some layers)
c = add([a, b])
# a.shape = [batch_size, x, y, c]
# b.shape = [None, x, y, c]
raises following error:
ValueError: Only tensors of same shape can be merged by layeradd_1 Got input shapes: [(None, 216, 176, 1), (8, 216, 176, 1)]
Thus we can not add a constant to a tensor, even given right batch_size, since the error is raised during compile time.
