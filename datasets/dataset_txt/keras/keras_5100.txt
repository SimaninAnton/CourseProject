Saving LSTM weights for a model trained in "mem" optimized mode and then trying to load them in a rebuild of the same model but in "gpu" optimized mode yields the following error.
Layer #6 (named "r1a" in the current model) was found to correspond to layer r1a in the save file. However the new layer r1a expects 3 weights, but the saved weights have 9 elements.
I can see why it's the case and why patching it would be a bit of a hassle but it's rather inconvenient.
