Training suddenly stops due to a segmentation fault after running successfully for several epochs.
I am using keras=1.2.0 and theano=0.9.0 and training on an GTX Titan X card. The number of epochs it successfully trains depends on the size of training data and the size of the network (but it runs at least 200 epochs before a fault).
The fault is definitely raised in:
keras/engine/training.py (line no: 844): outs = f(ins_batch)
I am still trying to write a small script that reproduces this problem but it seems to more of a Theano issue.
Any idea how to address this problem ? or even how to generate some logs to trace the error ?
