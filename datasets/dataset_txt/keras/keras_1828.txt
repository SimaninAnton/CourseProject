This is my first layer like you can see I have input shape (150,) and with the fixed batch size of 1 it becomes shape (1, 150).
My data (in this case new_state_m) has shape (150,) for example a numpy array with 150 zeros.
model.predict(new_state_m, batch_size=1)
But this gives me an input shape of (150, 1) so keras is putting the extra dimension for the batch size at the wrong place. I have also tried it without the batch_size specified a second time model.predict(new_state_m) but it didnt change anything.
The error occurs with tensorflow and theano. If you need more information to answer my question feel free to ask and thank you very much in advance
