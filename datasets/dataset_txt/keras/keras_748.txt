Currently keras and keras-preprocessing depends on each other.
Since it's already a separate module with it's own pip package, shouldn't we be able to use keras-preprocessing as an independent tool that does not depends on keras?
Having these two modules mutually depends on each other is causing conflicts at keras-mxnet (a keras fork) awslabs#129
same applies to keras-applications
