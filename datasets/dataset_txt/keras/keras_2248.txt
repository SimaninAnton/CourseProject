I am using different Keras models and I am changing different hyperparameters. I would like to do some profiling of the networks but I cannot find a way to do it and I could not find any mention to profiling in the Keras documentation.
I want to know how much time does it take to make a forward pass and how much of that time is spend on each layer. Ultimately, I would like to feed a batch of size n then get the time per layer for a forward pass. If the backward pass is included then it will be even better.
