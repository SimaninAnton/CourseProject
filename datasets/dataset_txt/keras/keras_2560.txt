Hello, I'm trying to define my own metric. It calculates concordance index which is a measure for regression problems.
def cindex_score(y_true, y_pred):
    sum = 0
    pair = 0    
    ylen=y_true.get_shape().as_list()[0]
    for i in range(1, ylen):
        for j in range(0, i):
            if i is not j:
                if(y_true[i] > y_true[j]):
                  pair +=1
                  sum +=  1* (y_pred[i] > y_pred[j]) + 0.5 * (y_pred[i] == y_pred[j])
    if pair is not 0:
        return sum/pair
    else:
        return 0
I get, "TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" error. Because ylen returns as None. I also posted this issue on GoogleGroups and Stackoverflow but so far no solution has came up, so I had to write this here as well.
Could you please help me about how to iterate within a Tensor object?
Best,
