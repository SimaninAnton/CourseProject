The following is described in the RMSprop docstring:
This optimizer is usually a good choice for recurrent
neural networks.
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/optimizers.py#L227-L228
However, I can not find another clear document that RMSprop is often used for RNN.
And, in my experience, Adam or another optimizer may give better results than RMSprop at not only CNN but also RNN.
If there is no reliable original information, I think that it is better to delete this sentence.
