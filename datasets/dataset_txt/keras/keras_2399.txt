I've been looking at some profiling tools available, the chrome timeline from tensorflow looks super useful this stackoverflow post, but its not documented and the only examples I can find to piece together how to run it are tensorflow models.
I am running keras with a tf backend, and my sequential models are all built in keras. For instance, this is how my model is being built:
   model.fit_generator( \
     generator= data_gen(args, 1), \
      steps_per_epoch=tr_steps, \
      epochs=args.epochs, \
      validation_data=data_gen(args, 2), \
      validation_steps=val_steps, \
      verbose=1, \
      callbacks=[checkpointer])
I am at a loss for how I would try to generate a timeline trace for this model, and wanted to know if Keras supports this? And how would I generate a trace for this?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
