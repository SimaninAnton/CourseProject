Hi, everyone, I am a newer to Keras. I have some issues of padding.
My data is a fixed length of features and a classifier label. For example (1,4,5,6,8,0,10,8,0). each feature have different means, i pad the feature if some of samples have no such feature with a label of zero. In the model, i want to sent the feature ids to a embedding layer and then connect the embedding result to MLP for classification. I know the keras Embedding layer have a mask_zero parameter but i am not sure how to use it. Anyone can give some advice for me? than you.
