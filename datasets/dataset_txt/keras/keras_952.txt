Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
fit_generator in engine/training_generator.py recreates the validation enqueuer at the end of every epoch.
There is a validation enqueuer that is created only once during training, but it's never set or used.
val_enqueuer = None
here
Instead, here,
val_outs = model.evaluate_generator( ....
is called, which creates a new enqueuer every epoch.
I do have a machine with 104 virtual cores. The time needed to create the enqueuer is over 25s on my system.
Is there a workaround / fix?
