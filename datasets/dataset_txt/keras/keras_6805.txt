@fchollet : I'm reading the codes of Keras, and I noticed that for every RNN layer, the get_output() function has a line
padded_mask = self.get_padded_shuffled_mask(train, X, pad=1)
My question is, why there's 'pad=1' additional padding? If a model consists of stacked RNN layers, this will mean the mask will become longer and longer
