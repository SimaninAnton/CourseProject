I use a custom layer for a trainable Swish Activation function : https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941. It can be set to non-trainable with any beta value, so it's quite general. I'd like to add it to Keras so that it can be part of the next release. It's quite popular. Or I can add it to keras contrib.
Where should I add the my code for Swish before making a pull request?
