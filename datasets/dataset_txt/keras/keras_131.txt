I want to initialize the initial state of an LSTM layer with the final hidden state of another LSTM layer. Basically, I want to implement the conditional encoding as explained in this paper https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1084
How do I access the final hidden state of one LSTM layer and use it as the initial state of another LSTM layer?
Thanks
