I've built a model with multiple outputs and need to balance the losses against each other.
The theano backend can do this via the loss_weights parameter in model.compile().
Unfortunately I'm using tensorflow.
How does Keras deal with multiple losses:
Do you add them and then take the derivative of the sum ?
Or do you optimize them individually ?
My idea is to just implement the losses I need myself and multiply the weighting factor into the loss manually. But that would only work if you're optimizing the sum of losses.
