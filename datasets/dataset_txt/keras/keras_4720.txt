I'm trying to use keras to do some NLP tasks. I want to initialize the word embedding layer with pre-trained word embeddings. But how to do that?
BTW, is it mandatory that input_dim must be specified in keras.layers.embeddings.Embedding(input_dim, output_dim, init='uniform', input_length=None, W_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, W_constraint=None, mask_zero=False, weights=None, dropout=0.0)
because generally you don't know how many words occur in the input data.
