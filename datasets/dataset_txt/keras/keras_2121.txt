training.py:_standardize_input_data needs a space between the number of expected inputs and the exception_prefix.
        if len(names) > 1:
            # Case: model expects multiple inputs but only received
            # a single Numpy array.
            raise ValueError('The model expects ' + str(len(names)) +
                             exception_prefix +
                             ' arrays, but only received one array. '
                             'Found: array with shape ' + str(data.shape))
        arrays = [data]
This generates exception text like "The model expects 2input arrays, but only received one array."
The fix is to add a space in the message.
            raise ValueError('The model expects ' + str(len(names)) + ' ' +
