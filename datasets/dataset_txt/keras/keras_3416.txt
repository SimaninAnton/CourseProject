Hi guys,
I just have a quick question as shown in the title of this post.
I know that keras displays the training time spent on each epoch if you turns on the 'verbose' parameter. But how can I get this training time manually and use it for other displaying purpose? Is there a builtin method for this? Because I can not seem to find it.
Thanks a lot and cheers,
Kevin
