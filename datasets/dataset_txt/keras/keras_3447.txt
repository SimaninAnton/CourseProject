First of all thanks for the wonderful example to get started with Embeddings.
While the goal of the example is to introduce to the world of Embeddings - I happened to notice that every single dataset includes the headers in the email - most of which should be fine except for the "Newsgroups" which is a dead giveaway on the output label
Perhaps the blog entry can be modified to reflect this fact - so that readers can take the accuracy of the output as not being representative and maybe the example can be modified to ignore the headers -till the one saying Lines:
The suggestion is just to prevent mismatch of expectations w.r.t very high accuracy with training on just 2 epochs

I am not too familiar with the history of this dataset and objective so please pardon my ignorance if the inclusion of the header is intentional)
