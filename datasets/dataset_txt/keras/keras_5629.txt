Hi,
I've trained a CNN, and now I would like to test it on big images. So for each pixel of the test image, I need to cut a neighborhood window / patch of size NxN.
Is that possible to use ImageDataGenerator (or an other function) to generate such batches of window/patches, and then use them into mymodel.predict_proba()?
Because I've seen example of ImageDataGenerator for training NNs, but it's not what I would need.
Thanks for your help.
