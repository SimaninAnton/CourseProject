I wrote the following cost function:
def cost_function(y_true, y_pred):
    leng = (y_true.shape[1]-1) / 2
    ytrue = y_true[:, -leng:, :]
    ypred = y_pred[:, -leng:, :]
    return binary_crossentropy(ytrue, ypred)
But Keras said
ValueError: The index list is longer (size 3) than the number of dimensions
of the tensor(namely 2). You are asking for a dimension of the tensor that
does not exist! You might need to use dimshuffle to add extra dimension to your tensor.
But I am pretty sure my model outputs a T.tensor3. The compiled output does have 3 dimensions. Where did the third dimension go? I tried to read the compile method but I had no clue. Have you experienced that before @fchollet ??? Am I missing something here?
