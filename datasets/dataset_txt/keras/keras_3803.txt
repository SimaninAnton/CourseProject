If I have a convnet with 30 filters, I want to be able to only train certain ones for a given input. For example I may only want to train the first 5 filters and not all 30 of them. How can I turn off learning for a given filter based on a given input (actually the value of the output for an input)?
I know that I will need a custom layer and think I need a batch size of 1 but I'm not sure about the latter. From what I could figure out so far it just seems like either all the weights are trainable or they're all not and you can't pick and choose a specific filter to train. Maybe with a mask but then I don't know if that's applicable by filter or just by weight value.
