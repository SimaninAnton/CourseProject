I just stumbledupon this paper https://people.csail.mit.edu/taolei/papers/emnlp16_rationale.pdf and it would cool to have this in keras, the actual code is at https://github.com/taolei87/rcnn/tree/master/code/rationale . This paper shows how to extract the phrase responsible for the sentiment score. This might be very helpful in numerous other application as well like QA etc.
