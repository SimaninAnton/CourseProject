For a simple 2-hidden-layer MLP, Keras with TF backend is 5x slower than theano backend, and 6x slower than pytorch using the same architecture. This is only for prediction, not training, and it is only on CPU.
Please see this gist for timing. This should be mainly a TensorFlow problem, since the raw TF implementation is still 3~4x slower than theano/PyTorch.
For reproducibility, the test was done on EC2 c5.large, deep learning AMI (ami-e07e779a). Got somewhat similar results on my own Mac, with all packages installed by conda.
My questions are:
Is this performance difference expected? Or there can be something wrong with TensorFlow installation?
Any way to speed-up the TF backend?
Not sure if this is the correct place to ask performance issue. Please feel free to close. Thanks.
