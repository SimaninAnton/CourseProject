The training data is read from two .npy files. Say, train_set is regarded as X, and train_label is regarded as Y. Therefore, it is not a multiple input case. My task requires to augment the image patches in different manner. So how to define different Image Generator for different patches? Although there could be a lot of patches, I use 3 patches as an example:
for patch1:
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20)
for patch2:
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=40)
for patch3:
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=60)
How to apply different generators on different patches, and how may I use the model.fit(...) or model.fit_generator(...) for the described scenario?
Also, Is there a way to rotate the image by a particular degree instead of a range?
Thanks!
