when I load a model that was saved in hdf5 that was using a custom loss function called dice_coef_loss I get the following exception
Exception: Invalid objective: dice_coef_loss
Even if I have defined the function in the current script it still raises this exeption.
Is this the normal behaviour? Do I have to install keras defining my custom loss in the source code?
