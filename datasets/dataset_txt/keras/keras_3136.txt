It appears that some th/tf backend functions are not equivalent.
Particularly the tf implementation of K.switch() through tf.select requires a purely boolean condition, while the th.switch() can also take a tensor. The equivalent of th.switch() is tf.where().
Is that an overlook or is it by design or am I just missing something?
