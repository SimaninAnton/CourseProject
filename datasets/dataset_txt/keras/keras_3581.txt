Currently, the callbacks EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau perform the same general function of carrying out some action after some number of epochs of no improvement on a monitored metric. These classes could be rewritten as subclasses of a more general class that monitors a quantity of interest and calls an action() function once this quantity ceases to improve. This would make it easy to implement other callbacks that are dependent on training progress in the future.
