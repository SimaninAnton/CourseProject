Hello All
http://keras.io/examples/#image-captioning
In the example of Image Caption, there is a function: Repeat()
model.add(Repeat(max_caption_len)) 
I couldn't find doc of this function in Keras.io
Perhaps it is for using the output y head as input feedbacks when generating sequences ?
Could anyone tell me what's it for, and which module I can find it ? Thank you !
