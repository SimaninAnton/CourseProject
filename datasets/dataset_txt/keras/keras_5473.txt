The preprocessing/test_image.py test is failing (both locally and on travis-ci). The error is in the setup_function, and it is:
> os.mkdir('test_images')
E FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'test_images'
I've spent some time trying to remedy this, fearing that it resulted from #2291 but I haven't been able to make heads or tails out of the test failure.
