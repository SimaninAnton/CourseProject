I am working on a project where I need to implement a custom layer that applies some transformation to my data, with the caveat is that that transformation is implemented in non-python code that cannot be used with the auto-differentiation used by Keras. With that said, I can calculate the gradients, and simply need a way to let Keras know it should use my supplied gradients instead of trying to use auto-differentiation.
In tensorflow, it seems that this can be solved by registering a gradient implementation. Is there something similar that I could do in Keras?
