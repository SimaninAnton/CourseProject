I've pieced together from @EderSantana and @jfsantos's commit history that there's HDF5 support for training Keras models on large datasets that cannot fit into RAM, but I've been unable to find instructions. The feature doesn't seem particularly documented, in fact.
I wonder if it's still actively supported, and if there are usage instructions somewhere. Just an example of how the HDF5 should be formatted, at least. Does it support multiple inputs/outputs, and so on?
Sorry if I'm missing something obvious!
