In reccurent.py, there are some codes like this
from .. import backend as K
x = K.reshape(x,(-1,input_dim)) 
x = K.reshape(x, (-1, timesteps, output_dim))
To see the effect of K.reshape, I type the following codes in Python console:
from keras import backend as K
input_dim = 1 # input_dim = x.shape[2], and x has the shape(60000,784,1)
xnew = K.reshape(x,(-1,input_dim) 
The resultant xnew has the shape 'Shape.0'.
I don't know what is the meaning of this.
And, what the difference of K.reshape() from the conventional reshape function?
