Hi! Dear All,
I know we can get the weights of LSTM by using "model.get_weights()". And it returns to me a 14-dimnesion list. I understand that the first 12 elements are:
W_i, U_i, b_i
W_c, U_c, b_c,
W_f, U_f, b_f,
W_o, U_o, b_o
But I don't know understand what are the last two elements.
Moreover, my final thought is to extract input gate i(t),output gate o(t) and forget gate f(t) in terms of time. Is there any easy and quick way to extract them.
I worte a code by myself trying to get i(t), o(t) and f(t) but it looks like it does not give me the right matrix. If it is necessary, I can post my code later.
Many thanks! These questions are really bothering me for a long time.
Best,
Oscar
