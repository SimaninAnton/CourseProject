I'd like to train a neural net on data X, Y where Y has shape (#samples, #outputs) but not all data points have measurements in all columns of Y. For example, perhaps the first row of Y is (100, 12) and the second row is (NA, 15). The motivation here is that I have some prior information suggesting that similar intermediate representations would be useful for learning each of the columns of Y.
Is there a way to do this with keras?
