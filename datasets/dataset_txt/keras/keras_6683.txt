Hi fchollet!
Thanks for great software, which was successfully applied by me to train convnets! It really saved me much time and pain, which I definitely had if I had to learn Theano :-)
But when I tried to run keras to learn word embeddings, I had figured out, that you probably mean to say 'model.fit(X, labels)' instead of 'model.train(X, labels)' ( in skipgram_word_embeddings.py, line 132 ). Because when I run this file as is, I'm getting this output:
Fit tokenizer...
0
Save tokenizer...
Build model...
Epoch 0
0
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./skipgram_word_embeddings.py", line 143, in
loss = model.train(X, labels)
AttributeError: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'train'
