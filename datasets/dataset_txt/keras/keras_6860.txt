Hi there,
Has anyone implemented a (Connectionist-Temporal-Classification)CTC loss with keras?
I attempt to add such a cost function in objectives.py file, based on rakeshvar's code. The model could be compiled, however, there are several errors when I do model.fit(). I am new to theano so it's really tough for me to debug...
It shouldn't be hard in theory, so I guess I made some "naive" mistakes...
