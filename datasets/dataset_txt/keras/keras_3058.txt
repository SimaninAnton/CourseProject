This is a feature request. Could model.summary() print the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) as well as the number of parameters?
From digging a bit through the code, this would require:
adding layer.count_flops() (what would be the preferred name of this?) as an analog for layer.count_params()
adding a call to that for each layer in print_layer_summary(layer) in layer_utils.py
adding one more column to the output (and to positions)
I would be interested in doing a PR for this, but I could use a little bit of help with the first of these. Could someone more familiar with keras under the hood do count_flops() for Convolution2D?
