I'm using a 1.0 version of Keras I updated within the last week or so. When I try to use the image data generator and set featurewise_center=True and featurewise_std_normalization=True to set the mean to 0 and the stdev to 1 of each image, the training goes fine, but the validation set either doesn't improve or only improves slightly. If I turn thee off, the validation set converges at nearly the same rate as the train set. How are these options implemented differently on the training/validation sets? (the validation set I am using is defined in the fit_generator using validaitond_data=***).
Thanks!
