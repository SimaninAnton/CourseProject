This issue has been raised before in #953, I believe the fix c4f3155 did not solve the issue.
Here is a code to reproduce:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense 

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(output_dim=64, input_dim=100))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.save_weights('test')

model2 = Sequential()
model2.add(Dense(output_dim=64, input_dim=100, trainable=False))
model2.load_weights('test') # get a ValueError "You are trying to load a weight file containing 1 layers into a model with 0 layers.
