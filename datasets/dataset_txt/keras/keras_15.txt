I want to transfer text to a list of word ids. I tend to use texts_to_sequences for convenience without any keyword argument before. But now I want to pass in a new char filters which do not consist of , . ? ! etc.
However, I encountered with this type of error:
TypeError: texts_to_sequences() got an unexpected keyword argument 'filters'
This is my code:
tok.texts_to_sequences([tt], filters='"#$%&()*+-/<=>@[\]^_{|}~ ')`
tt is a string of sentence.
It is Ok when I run:
tok.texts_to_sequences([tt])
So what's wrong with this ?
