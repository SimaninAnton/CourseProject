In models such as denoising auto-encoders it is often helpful to inspect the reconstruction results. However, noise is only available in the learning phase, not in prediction phase. Thus one cannot use model.predict but has to create a function from the model using K.function. This however may introduce bugs where the batch size is not correct and generates general discomfort.
Why not add a in_learning_phase parameter to Model.predict? E.g.
    def predict(self, x, batch_size=32, verbose=0, in_learning_phase=False):
        # ...
        if self.uses_learning_phase:
            ins = x + [1. if in_learning_phase else 0.]
        # ...
