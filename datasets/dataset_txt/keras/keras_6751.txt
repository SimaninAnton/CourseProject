I would like to suggest moving the fit and predict params (batch_size=128, nb_epoch=100 ... etc) to __init__(). Scikit-learn is phasing out any parameters that must be explicitly passed through fit & predict. This should make the model much easier to incorporate into ensembles and pipelines.
Perhaps we could shove all the params into a dict self.fit_params = {...} and load in defaults as necessary.
Thoughts?
