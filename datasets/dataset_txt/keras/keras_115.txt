you can see from this plot. The training acc and val_acc after first epochs keep 1. And corresponding loss are also very low. No matter how I change the parameters like epochs, batch, layers...It won't work...
My work is about classification and I have in totally 3 classes, each has about 1800 samples.
Can someone help me ?
