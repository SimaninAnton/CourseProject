hi, all~
i am processing with 3D volume data segmentation.
i wonder if keras can use the softmax loss as the loss function in the model.compile function.
i read some git answer, it said use activation='softmax' in the last layer and loss = 'category_crossentropy' , but when i use it it when to an error said that the last layer can not use 'softmax' as activation because it just can gandle the data 2D or 3D, but my layer input is 5D(example,x,y,z,channel)
now i use the activation 'sigmoid' in the last layer, and compile with loss = 'binary_crossentropy'
it can go. but i wonder it is any other advice to implemente the softmax loss with my 5D output data?
is there any body have a good idea?
thank you in advance!
