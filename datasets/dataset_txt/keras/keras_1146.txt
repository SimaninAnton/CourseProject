I like to learn about LSTMs, and following the code on that has worked for others, but not for me at https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/#comment-433162.
As soon as I typed the following line:
model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=100, batch_size=1, verbose=2)
I get a series of valueerrors - this is the cut-down version of the error output.
TypeError: c_compile_args() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\theano\tensor\blas.py”, line 443, in _ldflags
t0, t1, t2 = t[0:3]
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
lots of files from the Theano package were mentioned (cut out of the edit)
ValueError: (‘The following error happened while compiling the node’, forall_inplace,cpu,scan_fn}(Elemwise{maximum,no_inplace}.0, Subtensor{int64:int64:int8}.0, IncSubtensor{InplaceSet;:int64:}.0, IncSubtensor{InplaceSet;:int64:}.0, Elemwise{Maximum}[(0, 0)].0, Subtensor{::, int64:int64:}.0, InplaceDimShuffle{x,0}.0, Subtensor{::, int64:int64:}.0, Subtensor{::, :int64:}.0, InplaceDimShuffle{x,0}.0, Subtensor{::, :int64:}.0, Subtensor{::, int64:int64:}.0, InplaceDimShuffle{x,0}.0, Subtensor{::, int64:int64:}.0, Subtensor{::, int64::}.0, InplaceDimShuffle{x,0}.0, Subtensor{::, int64::}.0), ‘\n’, ‘The following error happened while compiling the node’, Dot22(, ), ‘\n’, ‘invalid token “=” in ldflags_str: “-LC:openblas -lopenblas;gcc.cxxflags = -shared -Ic:ming64winclude -Lc:python34libs -lpython34 -DMS_WIN64″‘)
This occurs even when I uninstalled Theano and successfully reinstalled using the git method on my Windows PC using the git/bash/mingw program:
pip install git+https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git#egg=Theano
source "bleeding edge installation" at http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_windows.html
Any idea please.
Thank you,
