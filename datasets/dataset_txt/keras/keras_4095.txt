Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Having a callback in the model:
csvc = keras.callbacks.CSVLogger('models/train/results.csv', separator=',', append=True)
and model compilation:
from keras.optimizers import SGD
sgd = SGD(lr=0.03, decay=0.01)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=sgd,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
In the final csv in column 'lr' I get always 0.03 instead of lr calculated by decay.
After looking at callbacks.py I think the problem is in the 'logs' object passed to callback not in the callback itself.
Any hints? I could try to make a PR - given some guidance
