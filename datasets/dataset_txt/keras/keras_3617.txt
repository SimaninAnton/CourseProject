Is there any implementation of LSTM-Conv Layerï¼Ÿ
Not the ConvLSTM.
Shown as the pic, like Conv1D in keras, but replace the conv kernel with LSTM (only keep the last output, return_sequence = False in keras), using LSTM-Conv Layer we can handle the very long sequence encoding problem(LSTM is also fail when the sequence length large enough). And we can stack this layer easily to get model "looks like" Convolution neural network.
