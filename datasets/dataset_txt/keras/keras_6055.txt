Hi,
I developped a recurrent convolutionnal layer according to LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214v1.pdf) for keras.
Before doing a pull request I would have liked some advices:
for the convolution part ,usually you can use or dim_ordering="tf" or "th" .
I can't make "th" work. I tried to debug, but I don't know why it does not work.
To use this layer, it is also nice to have a time distributed version of the 2D convolution layer.
I implemented one, but maybe it is too much to add two layers in the same pull?
I can't install tensorflow backend so I don't know if it works with it.
What are your suggestions?
