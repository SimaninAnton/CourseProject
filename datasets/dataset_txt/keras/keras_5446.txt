HI,
Thanks for making such a wonderful tool!
I'm using Keras 1.0. I want to save and load the model both the arch and the parameters. So I use the method in FAQ. Here is the code.
def save_model(self, model, options):
    json_string = model.to_json()
    open(options['file_arch'], 'w').write(json_string)
    model.save_weights(options['file_weight'])

def load_model(self, options):
    self.model = model_from_json(open(options['file_arch']).read())
    self.model.load_weights(options['file_weight'])
    return self.model
When I load model and use model.predict(), there is a error:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'predict'
Don't know why. If I don't load the model from file, just train a model and use it, everything seems ok.
I checked the issues, most people just need to load the parameters. Is it possible when I load the architecture, I overwrite the old model and loose the model.predict()?
Thanks again for making Keras!
