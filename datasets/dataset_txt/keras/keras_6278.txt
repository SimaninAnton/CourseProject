I have installed keras on a redhat 6 server, it is really a attractive framework cause it is really easy to build a deep neural network. However, I found my keras use only single thread(or single core). I ran examples given in the source code package, such as "mnist_mlp.py", and used "top" command, found the usage of CPU is 100%, never more than CPU, I have 6 cores, each with four threads, no GPU, so hope keras can make efficient use of all cores, however, it use only one thread.
I don't know whether this is caused by my theano or blas.
Below is some information about my keras:
System: redhat 6
Theano: 0.7.0
numpy: 1.10.1
scipy: 0.16.1
BLAS: atlas 3.8.4-1.el6
keras: 0.2.0
Does anyone know how to fix this? I will appreciate any suggestion. Thanks very much.
ps: I can not make keras run with multithreads on Ubuntu 15.10 either.
