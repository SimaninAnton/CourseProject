Hello,
The title might sound a bit confusing but I am trying to do some form of deep learning with LSTM. So, I am first training an LSTM to predict Part of Speech(POS) and I want to take the embeddings produce by training this POS LSTM layer and feed it to another LSTM to do some other form of tagging. I would like to know how I should proceed with feeding the embeddings from the POS LSTM later to the other tagging LSTM layer.
PS. What I want to achieve by doing so is when I train the POS layer, the output embeddings will have the POS features encoded which would be useful for my other tagging tasks.
Thanks!
