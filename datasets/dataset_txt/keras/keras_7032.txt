My reading of the docs and code is that Keras currently supports binary and multi-class classification problems, but it does not support regression problems. Is that correct?
I'm happy to take this on if you provide some guidance. It seems to me that it only requires adding a "continuous" class_mode to Sequential.compile() and renaming Sequential._predict() to Sequential.predict()
It seems likely I've missed something, but I think it'd would be a nice to support regression problems.
