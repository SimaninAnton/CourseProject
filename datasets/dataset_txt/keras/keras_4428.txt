I am working on a port of this project: https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv to use Keras instead of Lasagne.
My question centers upon how to best integrate a new custom loss function (cox proportional hazards regression for example) into the Keras paradigm:
def negative_log_likelihood(ytime, ystatus):
    LL_i = T.switch(T.eq(ystatus[i],1), self.theta - T.log(T.sum(self.exp_theta * T.gt(ytime, ytime[i]))),0)
Any pointers to get started would be of great assistance and sincerely appreciated!
