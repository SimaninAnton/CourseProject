I found ImageDataGenerator doesn't work well with write_images and histogram_freq option for TensorBoard callback. Anyone have any ideas about this?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
