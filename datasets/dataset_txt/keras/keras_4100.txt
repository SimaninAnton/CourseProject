When using tensorflow as the backend, there is an inconsistent api format regarding tensor shape.
For example, If i want an input placeholder tensor of shape, [None, 10]
In tensorflow I instantiate it as:
tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=[None, 10])
In []: <tf.Tensor 'Placeholder_4:0' shape=(?, 10) dtype=float32>
However if I use the same vector as a shape vector in Keras Input tensor:
Input(shape=[None, 10])
<tf.Tensor 'input_3:0' shape=(?, ?, 10) dtype=float32>
Si it adds an extra dimension.
Is this the desired behaviour? Not sure if this should be a feature request or a bug to be honest.
