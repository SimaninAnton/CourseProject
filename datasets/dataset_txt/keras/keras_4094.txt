Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I have a dir which contains some subdirs,and each subdir has some pics.When I use the following code to train a model,error occured like this.
TypeError: ufunc 'subtract' output (typecode 'O') could not be coerced to provided output parameter (typecode 'f') according to the casting rule ''same_kind''
Here is the train script.
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(featurewise_center=True, rescale=1./255)

train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    TRAIN_PATH,
    target_size=(64,128),
    color_mode='grayscale',
    batch_size=100)

model.fit_generator(
    train_generator,
    samples_per_epoch = 100,
    nb_epoch = 5
)
