Hi, I am new to Keras and RNN
I have a dataset that has 1000 videos, each video has 2000 frames and each frame has 5 features. I would like to train a RNN that can classify each video frame to 1 of the 3 categories.
Example
Video1
Frame1 [fc11,fc12,fc13,fc14,fc15] -> output1
Frame2 [fc21,fc22,fc23,fc24,fc25] -> output2
Frame3 [fc31,fc32,fc33,fc34,fc35] -> output3
...
Video2
...
x_shape = [1000, 2000, 5]
y_shape = [1000, 2000, 3] (Since each frame has it's own y value)
I am a little confused how to construct a Model that will fit this shape
