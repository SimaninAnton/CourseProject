this code:
model=InceptionV3(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, input_shape=None, pooling=None)
return this error
TypeError: Indexing elements must be in increasing order
I am using keras 2.0.2 and Theano 0.9.0 as backend .
I think it may be the weight file downloaded is in TF ordering.
