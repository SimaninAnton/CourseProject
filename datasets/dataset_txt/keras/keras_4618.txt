I am passing some diagnostic data from the training process to my browser
class LossHistory(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    # ts is my object to pass messages from a server where computations
    # happens to my browser 
    def __init__(self, ts):
        self.ts = ts      
    def on_train_begin(self, logs={}):
        self.losses = []

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs={}):
        x = logs.get('my_coef')
        self.losses.append(x)
        self.ts.train_dice_batch.add(x)

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
        self.ts.train_dice_epoch.add(logs.get('my_coef'))
        self.ts.valid_dice_epoch.add(logs.get('val_my_coef'))
using a specialized ts object. This works ok, but I would like to pass also images, that is outputs of intermediate layers of the network. Can it be done with the callback approach?
