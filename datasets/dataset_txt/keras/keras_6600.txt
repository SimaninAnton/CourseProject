Hi, I have a problem.
I want to use LSTM to classify multi-class video sequences with different segments with fixed dimension.
For example, I have two video sequences from 7 classes,
Video sequence A has 4 segments, each of which has 600-dimension features,
i.e. A=[600_dim,600_dim,600_dim,600_dim]
Video Sequence B with 3 segments, i.e., B=[600_dim,600_dim,600_dim]
the number of segments represent the time axis. 600-dimensional feaures are float.
How to organize the input video sequences as the input of LSTM, such as the shape (nb_samples, timesteps, features)?
Is it must be use the embedding layer for this varie-length video sequences?
