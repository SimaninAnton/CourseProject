Dear community,
I would like to try different architectures with same datasete, and am wonderfing if there is a way to clean the memory for parameters keeping the training dataset loaded in the system.
I checked stackover flow and other website, but could not find the solution.
My dataset is pretty big and takes long time to load, so I want to avoid the data importing everytime.
Thank you very much in advance.
