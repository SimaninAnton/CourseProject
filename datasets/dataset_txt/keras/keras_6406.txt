I am not sure if I get it right. But it seems to me that keras always pads the mask on the left:
    if pad > 0:
        # left-pad in time with 0
        padding = alloc_zeros_matrix(pad, mask.shape[1], 1)
        mask = T.concatenate([padding, mask], axis=0)
    return mask.astype('int8')
But if go_backward ==1, it should pad the sequence on the right, right? or override the get_input function to return X[::-1].
Can anyone help explain what did I miss?
Thanks!
