Hello everybody!!
I just write Model test with multiple output and I want take it all and put it into loss function.
But when I write model code with
model = Model([model.input, *y_true], [predic_label,L_loss])
predic_label and L_loss is output of lambda layer
shape:
predic_label : (None,10)
L_loss : (None,1)
And I compile with
def custom_Loss(y_true, y_pred): return y_pred model.compile(optimizer=optimizer ,loss={"L_loss": custom_Loss})
I put breakpoint into "custom_Loss" function and I receive two times break in function "custom_Loss"
pls help me !!!!!
