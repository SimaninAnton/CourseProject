Hi, I'm wondering if there are any handy ways to do large scale multi-task multi-label classification using multi-layer-perceptron?
My X has ~2000 features and my Y has ~1000 targets(tasks). Each target takes 3 possible labels(-1, 0, 1). I have looked into the graph model. It seems I need to manually type:
graph.add_output(name='output1')
graph.add_output(name='output2')
....
graph.add_output(name='output1000')
~1000 times. And to specify softmax as loss, I may also need to type something like
graph.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss={'output1':'softmax', 'output2':'softmax', ..., 'output1000':'softmax'}). Note that, each softmax output itself corresponding to a Nx3 matrix in my three-label case.
This is fine for small number of targets(<10?). But I'm wondering if there are cleaner ways to do it with 1000 targets?
Thanks so much!
