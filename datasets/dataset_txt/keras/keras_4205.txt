Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hey,
i implemented this tool to get the activations of a net for a specific layer like suggested in #41 (and many more)
def get_activations1(model, layer, X_batch):
    if layer==-1: #InputLayer returns data itself
        return [X_batch]
    else: #Output of Layer X
        get_activations = K.function([model.layers[0].input, K.learning_phase()], [model.layers[layer].output])
        activations = get_activations([X_batch,0])
        return activations    
so everythings works flawless and i love this functionallity, but it has one gamebreaker for me: Speed.
this Calculation for a given model with 3-4 Layers (20 neurons width each, Dense) takes about half of a second.
Since i want to work with the activations and do some (many) calculations (like 240000) this can´t do the trick.
is there a way to speed up things?
thank you
