I copied the entire example and ran it in my local. It says in the article that after 2 epochs validation set accuracy is 95%+ but when I tried it it was 20% and after 10 epochs it went around 70%.
I am really curious to know if anybody has ever met the same issue here, and if not what could I possibly have done wrong?
