With Tensorflow version 1.3 and Keras 2.2.4, i'm receiving error while creating sequential model
TypeError: softmax() got an unexpected keyword argument 'axis'
Help me to resolve this.
One such resolution i can across is to downgrade keras to lower version as new version doesn't support axis argument in softmax(). What are the steps i need to perform to download it
