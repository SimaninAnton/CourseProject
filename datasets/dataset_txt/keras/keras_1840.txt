I am training a model with merge layer. I assign [0.5, 0.5] as the "loss_weights" for two loss functions since I want the loss to be
loss = m1_loss * 0.5 + m2_loss * 0.5
But, the losses of one epoch look like this
loss: 2.2328 - m1_loss: 0.3732 - m2_loss: 0.2399
After checking the documents, still no clue.
loss_weights: Optional list or dictionary specifying scalar coefficients (Python floats) to weight the loss contributions of different model outputs. The loss value that will be minimized by the model will then be the weighted sum of all individual losses, weighted by the loss_weights coefficients. If a list, it is expected to have a 1:1 mapping to the model's outputs. If a tensor, it is expected to map output names (strings) to scalar coefficients.
Besides,
The loss value that will be minimized by the model will then be the weighted sum of all individual losses, weighted by the loss_weights coefficients.
sounds weird. Please check grammar.
Thanks.
