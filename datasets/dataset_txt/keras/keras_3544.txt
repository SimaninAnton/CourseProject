The VGG16 weight file seems to have an error in for the 1st FC layer
When you get the model and then try to run it, this error is given
ValueError: dimension mismatch in args to gemm (1,165888)x(25088,4096)->(1,4096)
upon further inspection, it appears the first FC layer has the wrong weight shape
model.layers[-3].W.get_value().shape
(25088, 4096)
which should be (165888 x 4096)
