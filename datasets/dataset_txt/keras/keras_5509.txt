By the way the HPC center I am using is setup, stdout and stderr are not visible until the computation finishes. I'm getting around this by creating custom output log-commands that write to files on a shared filesystem.
I want to be able to extract the output from model.summary into a string to output through this mechanism, rather than the current printing-only version.
