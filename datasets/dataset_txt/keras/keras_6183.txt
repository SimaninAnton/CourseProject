I'm doing text classification task with keras,but i get two different accuracy,which one should i to choose?
the details as following:
1.the predict method
Y_result=np.round(np.array(model.predict(X_test, batch_size=batch_size)))
acc = accuracy(Y_test,Y_result)
print('Test accuracy:', acc)
the result is about 0.98x.
2.the evaluate method
score, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test, batch_size=batch_size, show_accuracy=True)
print('Test score:', score)
print('Test accuracy:', acc)
the result is about 0.77x
Now i'm puzzled,which one is the true result?
3.By the way,another question is word embedding:
model.add(Embedding(maxfeatures, embedding_size,weights=init_weight))
For each sentence,i have converted it to many word index,weights is word vector matrix.
My question is how keras to construct word vector for each sentence?
Does keras sum or concatenate all word vectors of a sentence to an output vector?
Thanks.
