TensorFlow doesn't seem to have a rfft but only fft.
Theano has rfft but no fft.
I think rfft should be fine for most of the cases. Therefore I'd like to add a backend function under the name of rfft which uses theano's rfft and tensorflow's fft (This should be denoted in docstrings). Would it be okay?
