Hi,
I started to implement a siamese network.
I followed the tuto https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_siamese_graph.py which is well written and do pretty much what I want to do. The only difference is that my model is not sequential.
So in create_base_network(), I wanted to replace Sequential() by Model() but Model() needs a input which I give as the model need to be shared among inputs.
Any idea ?
