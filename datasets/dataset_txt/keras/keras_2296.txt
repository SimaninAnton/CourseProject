Hi, I'm trying to adapt this example to my code. I have a set of 60 records, and each one has 4 attributes and the class, they are natural number. I want to create a NN that training about this.
This is the code that I try to wrote:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(60,4))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
# we add a Convolution1D, which will learn filters
# word group filters of size filter_length:
model.add(Conv1D(25,10,
                 padding='valid',
                 activation='relu',
                 strides=1))
# we use max pooling:
model.add(GlobalMaxPooling1D())
# We add a vanilla hidden layer:
model.add(Dense(25))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Activation('relu'))

# We project onto a single unit output layer, and squash it with a sigmoid:
model.add(Dense(1))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
             optimizer='adam',
             metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X, Y)
But the compiler says this: https://pastebin.com/9WiHtKfJ
Thanks for the help!
