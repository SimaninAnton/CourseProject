I notice that mean is not called on categorical_crossentropy
def categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):
'''Expects a binary class matrix instead of a vector of scalar classes.
'''
return K.categorical_crossentropy(y_pred, y_true)
but on binary_crossentropy, mean is called.
def binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):
return K.mean(K.binary_crossentropy(y_pred, y_true), axis=-1)
Could someone explain why to me?
Thanks
