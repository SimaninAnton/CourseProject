I am recently working on a problem where I have LSTM layer in network. After LSTM, DNN layer is placed. I want to pass the input twice through the LSTM layer, once just to generate prior without any output. During second pass of the same input to LSTM, now LSTM shall generate the output sequence. This output after two passes over same LSTM, will be sent to the DNN layer. As keras provides so much less flexibility in sequential model and LSTM, I am not getting how can I handle this situation.
Thanks
