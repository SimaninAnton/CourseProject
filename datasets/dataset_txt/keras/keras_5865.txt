It seems that there is no a simple way to insert a projection layer for an RNN as described in "Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling" (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02410v2.pdf):
"Exhaustively trying all combinations would be extremely time consuming for such a large data set, but our findings suggest that LSTMs with a projection layer (i.e., a bottleneck between hidden states as in (Sak et al., 2014)) performed well."
