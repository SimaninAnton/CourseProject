The default axis for mode 0 is -1. In the tf convention this is normalization per feature map, but in the (more common?) th convention, this normalizes per last dimension of the input. If input is >1D, this doesn't make sense: it treats one of the dimensions as "special".
Should the default be changed to conditionally set it to -1/+1 based on image_dim_ordering?
