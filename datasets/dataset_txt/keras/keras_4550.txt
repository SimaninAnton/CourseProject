For generating different initial random state for neural network I have been doing this based on
suggestions in the forum:
import numpy as np ;
import datetime ;
np.random.seed(datetime.datetime.now().microsecond)
from keras import ....
(setting numpy random seed before importing anything from keras).
Now, assume that I want to train/evaluate a neural network with different initial random states,
for 10 times, and take average of f-scores. I had to run the file externally for 10 times (e.i., python myprog.py) to make it work.
Now assume I want to this inside python:
for i in range(10):
import numpy as np ;
import datetime ;
np.random.seed(datetime.datetime.now().microsecond)
from keras import ....
train()
evaluate()
but I guess this will not do it, because keras is already imported.
does del np, del keras, inside the function works?
does reload (np), reload (keras) works ?
What is the correct way of doing this?
Thanks in advance.
