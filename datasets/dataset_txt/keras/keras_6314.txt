Old saved json models (old as in ~1 week old) have this argument '"truncate_gradient": -1', whereas new ones do not. When trying to load these older saved model structures with from_json in the latest keras, it fails with this assert:
assert kwarg in {'input_shape', 'trainable'}, "Keyword argument not understood: " + kwarg AssertionError: Keyword argument not understood: truncate_gradient.
I know sometimes keras makes API-breaking changes, but was this intended? If not, can we just ignore the truncate_gradient argument here instead of Asserting?
