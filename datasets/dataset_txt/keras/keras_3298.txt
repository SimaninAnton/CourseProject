I'm writing my own activation function (element-wise cubic) with the template from https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L255.
I searched the Keras backend and only found the square() function.
I also see the pow() function, but it needs another tensor with the same shape of the input. Can anyone teach me how to implement that?
