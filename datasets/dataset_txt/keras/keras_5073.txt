I am having trouble generating preprocessed images. This is what I have
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True) 
I get the following error when I run this:
for i in datagen.flow(train_images,train_images,32):
    print i
File ".../keras/preprocessing/image.py", line 302, in next
x = self.random_transform(x.astype('float32'))
File ".../keras/preprocessing/image.py", line 359, in random_transform
ty = np.random.uniform(-self.width_shift_range, self.width_shift_range) * x.shape[img_col_index]
IndexError: tuple index out of range
numpy.shape(train_images) is (100,256,256). It has 100 grayscale images each of which is 256x256 in size. The generator however works with the cifar10 dataset in the sample code.
