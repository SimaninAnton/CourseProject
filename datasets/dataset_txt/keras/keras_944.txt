I run a keras model on Ubuntu with cuda8.0.
KerasModel: I do not have such problem with some model but with the model that have a custom layer which take list of tensor as input and list of tensor as output. And I use keras.backend.prod.
package info : Keras 2.1.0 ; Tensorflow-Gpu 1.4.0
GPU info: Tesla K40m

Are there anybody know about how to fix this?
