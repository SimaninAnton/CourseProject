Recently I read the paper Learning End-to-end Video Classification with Rank-Pooling(url) and I am interested in the way of customing gradients of rank_pool function for the bi-level optimization problem. Could we implement one rank layer in keras and custom the gradients of trainable weights in that layer? Or other ideas?
