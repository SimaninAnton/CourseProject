I am trying to tweak keras to generate the loss for each individual training instance in each epoch. The _fi_loop(.) function in engine/trainining.py generates average loss and accuracy for each "batch," at
  outs = f(ins_batch)
Any hints on how to get the loss value for each individual instance?
Thanks in advance
