Hello,
I get a value error while playing the code of an auto-encoder https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder.py.
In order to get it to work I need to choose a batch size that is a divisor of the train size ( train.shape[0] % batch_size == 0)
Is there anyway I can solve this issue ?
Thank you very much.
