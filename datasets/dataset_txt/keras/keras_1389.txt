Hi,
I am using fit_generator with a data_generator for validation_data.
The code is:
history=model.fit_generator(generator=generator_trai,steps_per_epoch=200,epochs=2,validation_data=generator_val,validation_steps=15)
I set validation_steps=15. Because of the default queue_size of 10 I expect the generator to add 25 batches to the queue in the first epoch. 15 of 25 for doing the validation in the first epoch and further 10 for filling up the queue. So far so good. But I am wondering why the generator adds futher 25 batches in the second epoch. In my opinion it should only add the 15 batches that are used for validation in second epoch.
Why is this happening?
The Training Generator works as supposed. Adding 210 batches in first epoch and futher 200 batches in second epoch.
Thanks in advance.
