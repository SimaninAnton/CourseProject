So, I created a simple CNN for the MNIST dataset, and when I am training it with verbose = 1, I suppose I should be getting progress bars that fill up over time (Correct me if I'm wrong here). Instead of updating, I the progress bar is just getting printed over and over again until the training is done. Example:
1824/60000 [..............................] - ETA: 1:12 - loss: 1.5713 - acc: 0.5620 1888/60000 [..............................] - ETA: 1:12 - loss: 1.5413 - acc: 0.5683 1952/60000 [..............................] - ETA: 1:12 - loss: 1.5180 - acc: 0.5743 2016/60000 [>.............................] - ETA: 1:11 - loss: 1.4878 - acc: 0.5813 2080/60000 [>.............................] - ETA: 1:11 - loss: 1.4603 - acc: 0.5885
And so on. I am getting this both on Pycharm and through the python console (even moved the .py file outside the folder, so I'd be using Tensorflow and Keras I manually installed and verified they're up to date.
Any clues?
P.S. Here is my code: https://gist.github.com/omer54321/bde99aa48794a4221fd308a2c55a33dc
