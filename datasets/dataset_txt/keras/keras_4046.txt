CODE:
from multiprocessing import Pool
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1. / 255)
pool = Pool(processes=batch_size)
for x in datagen.flow_from_directory(image_dir, class_mode=None, batch_size=batch_size,target_size=(128, 128)):
     for i in range(batch_size): 
        pool.apply_async(fun,(x,i))
     pool.close()
     pool.join()
but the program died in pool.join()
How to solve the problems?
