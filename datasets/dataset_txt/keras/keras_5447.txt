Hi, thanks for the update to 1.0.1.
i'm trying to run the babi_rnn.py and babi_memnn.py, however, it raises a error like this:
Downloading data from http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/babi/tasks_1-20_v1-2.tar.gz
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "babi_rnn.py", line 149, in <module>

  File "/home/zzhao/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/data_utils.py", line 76, in get_file
    raise e

by typing the address http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/babi/tasks_1-20_v1-2.tar.gz
in Browser i can download the file manually, so i guess the download not on Browser is banned by the website.
Btw, i have the Anaconda python 2.7.
Thanks for replying.
Best wishes
