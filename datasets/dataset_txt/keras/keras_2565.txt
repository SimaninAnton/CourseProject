I am running training a dynamic memory network which requires a for loop. When I train the model architecture that repeats layers, I am unable to save it using model.save. I am using TF as the backend. Here is the line that errs out.
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/engine/topology.py", line 2303, in get_config
return copy.deepcopy(config)
Any ideas?
Thanks
