When I added a BatchNormalization layer in my architecture definition, I got a error as follows:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'input_15' with dtype float [[Node: input_15 = Placeholder[dtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"]()]] [[Node: batch_normalization_5/moments/sufficient_statistics/Shape/_551 = _Recv[client_terminated=false, recv_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0", send_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0", send_device_incarnation=1, tensor_name="edge_1060_batch_normalization_5/moments/sufficient_statistics/Shape", tensor_type=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]()]]
I have eliminated the error by set mode==2. However, the 'mode' param of BatchNormalization layer is cancelled in Keras2. Now, the error comes back! Any suggestion?
