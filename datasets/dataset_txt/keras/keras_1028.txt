Hi,
I've been trying to run this
keras/example/deep_dream.py
but it does not work and gives me the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "deep_dream.py", line 13, in <module>
    from keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, save_img, img_to_array
ImportError: cannot import name 'save_img'
because, well, the "save_img" function is not in keras.preprocessing.image any longer...
Obviously, if I skip loading the "save_img" function in the beginning,
it all works fine until the last line...
..Loss value at 8 : 9.004611
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "deep_dream.py", line 188, in <module>
    save_img(result_prefix + '.png', deprocess_image(np.copy(img)))
NameError: name 'save_img' is not defined
Is there a workaround to save the image?
