Hi Keras,
Using border_mode = 'same' is causing a substantial slowdown (230s/epoch with same vs 132 with valid, theano backend) in my model using 3D convolutions. I realize this is likely an upstream issue as theano only supports valid border mode in conv3d2d, but I was wondering a few things
is that still the fastest way to perform this operation? there is a DNN variant, but I haven't researched it much
Is the current method of set_subtensor the fastest? Theano implements a pad_left and pad_right method which could possibly be faster. I haven't done any testing of any of this but thats a pretty substantial slowdown.
Should I open up a ticket upstream with theano as well?
Thanks
