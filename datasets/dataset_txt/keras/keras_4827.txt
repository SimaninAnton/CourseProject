As far as I know there's no cropping layer in Keras.
If it's true, is it just because not many people need this? I'm curious.
I might need one and wondering if it's just me who want this sort of thing.
In detail, it's just the opposite of zero-padding, i.e. can cut off some of the data in arbitrary dimension.
