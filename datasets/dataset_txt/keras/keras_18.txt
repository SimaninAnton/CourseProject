I'm using keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint to save the result. Cause I get three outputs, I worry about there may be error feedback if I set monitor = 'val_loss'.
I know I can set monitor as 'val_loss', 'accuracy' and so on, but how to set monitor according to my ouput?
And my output is following
[<tf.Tensor 'a/Softmax:0' shape=(？, 2) dtype=float32>,
 <tf.Tensor 'a/Softmax:0' shape=(？, 118) dtype=float32>,
 <tf.Tensor 'a/Softmax:0' shape=(？, 315) dtype=float32>]
Or the function will just work according to overall loss?
