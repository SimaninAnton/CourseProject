[x ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[x ] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
[x ] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I'm essentially running into the same "issue" as #2603 - I'm training a relatively small model on very small batches, so the update is basically instant, and flushing metrics to stdout+file is relatively large. The "problem" is that this is deliberate behavior, but I still get these lengthy warning messages cluttering my console.
I'd like to be able to suppress these warnings, without suppressing any other potentially useful warning messages. If there's already a way to do this, or if it's not too much trouble to slip in that behaviour, that would be amazing.
Thank you!
