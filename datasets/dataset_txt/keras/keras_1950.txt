I recently upgrade keras from 2.0.5 to 2.0.6 and it leads to test fails in another project called Jep (ninia/jep#84 (comment)).
The main reason is that keras==2.0.6 creates a directory named tests/ directly under site-packages/. Jep has ./tests directory under its project root directory for its test files. I think such a directory naming convention seems quite common for other projects.
I think the tests directory should be moved under site-packages/keras/.
