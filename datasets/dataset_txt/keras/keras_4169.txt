Hi,
I have a problem when I use keras model (deep learning library) in jupyter notebook
Before executing code cell, my computer GPU memory is 241 Mib / 8113 MiB
And I executed simple keras model code
After executing above code, GPU memory usage change from 241MB to 7754MB
So, when I run training cell code, jupyter died
This problem happend again and again... even though I restarted my jupyter notebook..
Strangely, this problem not happend when I run same code in CPU (not using GPU)
Is there any good idea to solve this problem??
