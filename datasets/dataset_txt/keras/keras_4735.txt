Hello. First of all, thank you for Keras! I love using it
I am trying to reduce dimension of output of conv3 layer by using random projection.
I am especially trying to use random projection provided by scikit library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).
Could I ask how I could use the library in Keras (maybe implementing in the Lambda layer)?
Or does Keras have similar built-in functionality?
Thank you in advance!
