I have a question about the Keras CNN Layer process on Tensorflow. According to Keras summary, the CNN layer is expected to include not only the kernel weights (e.g. 3 x 3) but also the bias weights and thus makes it 9 + 1 = 10 in total for a single convolutional kernel.
However, I profiled the Tensorflow-backend syscall and I see not bias weight is managed by Tensorflow, so does it mean Tensorflow backend for Keras doesn't support handling CNN bias weight?
