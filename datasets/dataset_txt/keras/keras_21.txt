Hello,
I implemented ssd7 (https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras/blob/master/ssd7_training.ipynb) and got error(ValueError:Tensor(training/Adam..).And I tried tensorflow 1.13-2.0 and with keras 2.0-2.3 and no luck. Also tried to changed K. Clear_session() to keras.backend.clear_session() and still have same error. Also tried on conda and pip.
Can anyone help ?
