Hi. I am trying to implement a birdirectional recurrent network. As there is an option in keras for recurrent model, to set go_backwards =True, to process the input sequence backwards. As far I can tell from the source, it uses theano_scan go_backwards flag. From theano implementation, I think it processes the input backwards, but does not flip the output along the timestep dimension. Generally, such reversal is important in most bidirectional implementation. I would like to confirm if the output is flipped in time or not while using go_backwards in keras. (One can use Lambda layer to flip later but it would be nice if it is explicit in documentation like some other alternate libraries such as lasagne.)
