Hello,
I have a big dictionary with several parameters for my model implementation, including parameters for for the Model.fit() method but not only.
Since the Model.fit() signature has the **kwargs key, I would expect that passing a dict with more parameters than the ones request by Model.fit(), it should simply infer which parameters take.
Here a dummy example:
class  Model(Container):
   ...
   def fit(a, b, **kwargs)

my_parameters = {
   "a": 1,
   "b": 2,
   "c": 3
}

model = Model(...)
model.fit(**my_parameters)
This should simply works. Instead, at line 1619 of training.py, in the Model.fit() implementation there is
if kwargs:
raise TypeError('Unrecognized keyword arguments: ' + str(kwargs))
that throws the exception
TypeError('Unrecognized keyword arguments: 'c')
Commenting those two line, everything works perfectly.
The question is: is there any reason for that if clause? Why is it present and can it be removed?
