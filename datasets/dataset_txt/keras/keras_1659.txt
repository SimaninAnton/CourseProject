Hello,
I'm in trouble because I'm not able to manage correctly the CNN and maybe the LSTM-RNN.
I'm trying to solve the following problem. I've 20000 chunks of data that each of them are composed by a sequence of 20 images. The size of each image is 40x40. The images are in grayscale mode. For each chunk of data, we have two possible labels, 0 or 1. We have to classify each chunk of data in two possible sets: 0 or 1. As they are numpy arrays, the shape of each one is:
Data shape: (20000, 20, 40, 40)
Labels shape: (20000, 1)
Well, I want to train a CNN to predict if the label of a chunk of data is 0 or 1. Remember that each chunk of data is composed by 20 images of 40x40 in grayscale. And the most important thing is that the order of that 20 images matter. I mean, they have to be managed as a 'little' video file of 20 images. If we change the order of that 20 images in a chunk of data the label should be different.
I don't know if is mandatory to use a RNN. I've read some papers where the researchers have used CNN without LSTM and with LSTM for trying to solve similar problems. I think that it isn't mandatory but I think that I've to use the combination of CNN with TimeDistributed. Am I right?
Thank you so much in advance.
Kind regards,
