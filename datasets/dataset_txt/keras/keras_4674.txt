Hi, I have cloned (and made some minor revision on the evaluation and training process, which should not hurt the performance) the following
It is a reimplementation of the architecture mentioned in: dos Santos 2016
I get the result roughly the same result as the nice guy who does the reimplementation: 4x for biLSTM+attention and 5x for cnn. The author of the paper reports 6x-70%.
Any idea? Participants (including me) of the issues thread of the reimplementation do not find anything wrong in the architecture of the reimplementation. Any idea? Thanks in advance.
