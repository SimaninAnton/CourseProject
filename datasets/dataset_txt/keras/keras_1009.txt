I'm trying to use Intel NLP Architect and its example has this line that makes it not working:
>>> from keras.engine import saving
Using TensorFlow backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'saving'
Anyone knows how to fix it? Thank you!
Also this is a link to the whole framework: http://nlp_architect.nervanasys.com/ner_crf.html But the line that makes it not working is just that one line.

If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
