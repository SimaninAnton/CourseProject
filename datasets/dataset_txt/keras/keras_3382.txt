Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
Hi,
I was wondering if a model of the following kind is possible in keras. I am trying to implement a recurrent version of conditional variational auto encoder and would like to try some different models so in one case this cyclic nature arises. I simplified the whole model but his is the problem which I can't solve. i.e. can we have a cyclic graph in keras? Looks like a cycle is allowed in tensor-flow and theano by the methods tf.while_loop . What are your thoughts?
