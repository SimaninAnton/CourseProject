I am with keras v2.0.5, tensorflow 1.2.0
at keras/docs/templates/getting-started/functional-api-guide.md, line 316, we have an error
import keras 
from keras.layers import Conv2D, Input

# input tensor for a 3-channel 256x256 image
x = Input(shape=(3, 256, 256))
# 3x3 conv with 3 output channels (same as input channels)
y = Conv2D(3, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
# this returns x + y.
z = keras.layers.add([x, y])
Error message:
ValueError: Operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3, 256, 256) (3, 256, 3)
Where exactly went wrong, and how to solve it? Thanks
