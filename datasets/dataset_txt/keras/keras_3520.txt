Hello,
I don't know if it is the right way to ask for it and if it already exists but last year I had the idea to put Factorization Machines layers into neural networks (aka Neuralization Machines). I did it very easily on Keras.
So I thought it can be cool to add this functionality into next Keras versions.
Unfortunately I don't have time to learn how to do a pull request and how to respect Keras' code syntax (and I am sorry for that), but please find attached my working 2-way Factorization Machines layer.
custom.py.zip
I think it can be also very interesting
to make it handle sparse input matrices
to make it handle more than 2-way interactions using Geffy (https://github.com/geffy/tffm) or Mathieu Blondel and co.'s work ("Higher-Order Factorization Machines")
and to make it work with RNNs (like making it time distributed or putting it directly inside the LSTM) to handle better temporal effects (like to prevent from recommending always the same kind of music...)
I just hope that my post can help to build a kind of ultimate recommender system.
