After updating Keras to 2.2.3 and using Tensorflow version 1.11.0, I am unable to load saved models.
I am running a script on Google Cloud's Debian machine and am able to save and load the model there, but I am facing the error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'name' referenced before assignment" when calling load_model on my local Ubuntu machine.
