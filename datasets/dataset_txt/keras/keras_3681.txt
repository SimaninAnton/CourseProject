Hello and congratulations for this active helping community...
I want to add an Euclidean loss layer that computes the sum of squares of differences of its two inputs at the end of my model... in other words i want to use euclideanloss as an activation function for my final Dense layer. Is this implementation for this activation function already available in Keras or do i need to write it by myself?
I would be grateful if someone could provide me further information on this matter,
Thank you all for your time!
