1.dump your model with model.to_json()
2.load your model with model_from_json
3.will show class_mode deprecated warning
problem: when using keras in tornado, any warning will keep the whole process from running, so I have to delete the class_mode from the json to load it properly.
fix:
1.don't dump the class_mode from model.to_json(), i think this is best solution
or 2. don't read class_mode from model_from_json
or 3. don't raise deprecated warning
