New to Keras and DL, so I may be asking really basic questions... appreciate if someone could explain in an easier term. Thanks!
How to use a custom objective function for a model? Any sample code I could look into to reference from?
It seems models can only accept a string of the pre-defined objective functions here : https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/objectives.py
However, the doc (http://keras.io/models/) sounds like as if I could just plug in a custom function like score(true, pred):
loss: str (name of objective function) or objective function.
The source code also seems to say it's only string: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/models.py#L240
