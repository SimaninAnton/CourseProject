TensorBoard is a great tool for visualizing how your network is training, but currently the related callback can only trigger graphs, histograms and embedding generation. It would be useful to (I think) anybody to be able to specify to include the metrics (all of them), or maybe a (sub?)-list of them, or even to explicitly pass a list of functions/tensors to calculate them.
Example API:
keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=0, batch_size=32, write_graph=True, write_grads=False, write_images=False, embeddings_freq=0, embeddings_layer_names=None, embeddings_metadata=None, metrics = ['loss', 'val_loss'])
