Is there a way to learn unsupervised features from set of images. Similar to word2vec or doc2vec, where neural network is learnt and given new document we get its features.
Expecting similar to this example https://dato.com/learn/gallery/notebooks/food_retrieval-public.html shows that it can load learnt nn-model and predict features for new images.
Is there any simple example how to implement cnn over images and get their features back will help !!
Edit : Suppose in this example https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py
If I want to get cnn features for all X_train and X_test ... is there any way ?
Also , if we can get weights per layer per image, we can stack them and use as features. In that case is there a way to get the same.
Using those features for unsupervised task would be easier, if we consider them as vectors.
