Hi,
I have a Sequential model which was running perfectly fine till last week.
I recently updated keras to 2.3.0 and when I try to run model.predict command on my trained model it throws error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/opt/program/predictor.py", line 69, in predict
    a=model.predict(x_input, verbose=0)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1456, in predict
    self._make_predict_function()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 378, in _make_predict_function
    **kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras/engine/network.py", line 323, in __setattr__
    super(Network, self).__setattr__(name, value)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras/engine/base_layer.py", line 1215, in __setattr__
    if not _DISABLE_TRACKING.value:
  File "src/gevent/local.py", line 408, in gevent._local.local.__getattribute__

AttributeError: 'gevent._local.local' object has no attribute 'value'
It got resolved when I switched keras back to 2.2.5
