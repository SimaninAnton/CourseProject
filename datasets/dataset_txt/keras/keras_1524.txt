Hi,
I have huge amount of training data (around 52Gb). I can't load it onto memory as numpy array to pass it to keras models.
So, I used spark to create an rdd. I am not sure how to pass the rdd's to keras?
What is the best approach to send that huge amount of data to keras models on local machine of 32Gb RAM?
