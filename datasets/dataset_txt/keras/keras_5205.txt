when I try to visualize the output of an intermediate layer which is mentioned in http://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-visualize-the-output-of-an-intermediate-layer, I get a mistake
I don‘t know what caused the problem. Maybe the instruction is not suitable for non-sequential model because it works well on others' sequential model. Does any one encounter the same problem?
