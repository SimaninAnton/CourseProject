Is there a way to print the output of a layer during training? I am trying to debug a attention model in which the loss is not at all changing during training. I have tried changing learning rates, checking data sanity, but to no success. I want to see whether the layer outputs actually make any sense during training (eg. is my Lambda layer slicing correctly etc.).
I know I can print the weights by using,
Wr=m.nodes['Wr'].get_weights()
emb=m.nodes['emb'].get_weights()
but I want the output. When I do m.nodes['emb'].get_output() I get a theano variable instead.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
