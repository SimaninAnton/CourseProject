Hey guys,
I was wondering how are the initial internal states in a recurrent layer dealt with? So far it appears they are reset are every run. Is there any way to preserve them?
I'd like to be able to feed a .predict_proba() function data one time step at a time for a time series task, as the points come in, without also feeding the entire history all over again. Is this somehow possible? Thanks
