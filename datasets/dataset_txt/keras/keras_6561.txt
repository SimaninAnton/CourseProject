Hello,
After first rolling my own neural net. Then, hopping on the CxxNet bandwagon but being disappointed that they abondoned it, I'm looking at keras right now.
I want to extend the network with my own layers and ideas. For instance fractional max-pooling.
However.. I do not see an easy-fast implementation in theano. (partly due to my inexperience with it)
If I would make a c-based kernel.. Have you any idea how easy it would be to make it work with Keras/theano ? Are there any pointers ?
