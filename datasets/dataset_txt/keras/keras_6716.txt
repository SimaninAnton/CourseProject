For example:
I have two theano Tensor variables, each of them is a 4D tensor.
        X= self.get_input(train)
 #       X3 = np.zeros((int(X.shape[0]), int(X.shape[1]), 2, int(X.shape[3]-self.nb_col-self.index)))
        X3 = T.tensor4()

        X1= X[:,:,:,0:X.shape[3]-self.nb_col-self.index]
        X2= X[:,:,0,self.nb_col+self.index:]
Now, I would like to merge X1 and X2 as X3.
I hope X3 should be:
X3[:,:,0,:]=X1
X3[:,:,1,:]=X2
Can I implement it using theano?
Thans!!
