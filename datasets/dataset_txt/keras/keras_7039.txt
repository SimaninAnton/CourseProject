Here are the key features that we will have in Keras by the time it hits v1.0.
Visualization tools, possibly built on top of Bokeh. You should be able to see everything that's going on in your experiment, and maybe even manage your experiments from a GUI. Total visualization is key to doing good research.
Easy support for Spearmint for hyperparameter search.
Complete unit tests. The recent regularizers/constraints debacle that left Kaggle users confused highlights once more that reliable unit tests should be an absolute priority. We want to be able to develop quality code safely and with confidence.
Better convnet features, including FFT convolutions, and maybe new padding options. In the medium term we should look into incorporating support for Nervana Systems' fast convolution kernels. Let's stay state of the art ;-)
Support for non-sequential models, by the way of:
[DONE] a Merge container that takes a list of Sequential models and turns them into a single output
a Fork container that replicates the output of a Sequential model to a list of Sequential models
(both would be trainable end-to-end, of course).
If you see anything you would like to work on, please post here with your thoughts on how you would incorporate it into the current architecture / data structures. This is our opportunity to make a big contribution to the deep learning ecosystem! : )
