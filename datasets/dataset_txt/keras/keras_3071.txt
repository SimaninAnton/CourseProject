I have data as features in probability values. The values are too small. I want to know which normalization i should use and I used convolution1d and dnn, and lstm. But the performance is too les. If i use the same data with DBN tool box in matlab, the accuracy was 70%. Could you please tell how to improve the accuracy. I think i am getting less accuracy because the input data is too small. In DBN matlab tool box they have an option to set input data as binary or probability. This shows train accuracy as 1 in 1 epoch and it remains same till 100 epoch but validation accuracu in epoch was 40% and it decreases till 1000 epoch in lstm, convolution1d and dnn

ilities values.
