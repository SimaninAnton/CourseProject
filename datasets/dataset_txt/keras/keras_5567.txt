Hello,
I have a question regarding a many-to-many LSTM architecture. Let's say my input are a sequence of word-vectors and at the end of the model I have a time distributed dense to model the many-to-many architecture. Let's say I have X hidden nodes. Is is that for each word-vector is the sequence I have X hidden nodes or is it that for all word-vectors together have X hidden nodes. If it's the latter, how can I proceed to do it such that each word-vectors have X-hidden nodes.
Thanks!
