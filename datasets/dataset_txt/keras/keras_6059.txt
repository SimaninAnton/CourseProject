when shuffle=True in ImageDataGenerator.flow
there is a single shuffle and then the generator never terminates.

It should reshuffle before every epoch.
If seed is also given then this should some ensure that overhaul the sequence will be the same.
For example, the per epoch shuffle could be seeded with the seed and an epoch counter
