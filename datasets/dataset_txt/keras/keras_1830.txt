I would appreciate an easy way to change the default behavior when changing from a backend to another once a code base has already considerably grown (e.g.: input shapes and output shapes are defined and fed in a certain way, but changing the backend would imply changing those ways of feeding).
For example, calling something like:
model.change_image_data_format(from="channels_first", to="channels_last")
Which would call K.set_image_data_format("channels_last") at some point under the hood, or doing something similar.
This could be achieved by adding many transpositions layers right after the inputs and before the outputs or something like that, despite I am conscious this would sacrify a bit of performances.
Having such a feature would be appreciated to avoid changing to many things in the code base when going from a backend to another. Thanks!
