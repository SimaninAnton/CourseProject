The imagedatagenerator passes a 3D array to the preprocessing_function. However applications preprocess_input requires a 4D input.
For example this does not work:
 batches = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=resnet50.preprocess_input). 
                                                                   flow_from_directory(join(path, "valid"))
