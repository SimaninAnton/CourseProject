Now, I have a question about the 4D tensor on keras about Convolution2D Layers.
Keras doc says :"4D tensor with shape: (samples, channels, rows, cols) if dim_ordering='th' or 4D tensor with shape: (samples, rows, cols, channels) if dim_ordering='tf'."
I use 'tf',how about my input?when I use (samples, channels, rows, cols),it is ok, but when I use (samples, rows, cols, channels) as input,it has some problems.
