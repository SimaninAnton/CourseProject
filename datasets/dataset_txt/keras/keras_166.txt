I have a rookie question with respect to persisting model with embedding layers. When we persist the model using save or to_json method, does it save the vectors used in the embedding layer?.
If it is not saving the vectors used for the embedding layer, can someone point to a resource that will help me to add embedding layer to a model that is loaded from a file?
Thanks
