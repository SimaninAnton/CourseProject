Hello,
I am trying to stack the output of my convolution neural network into an LSTM. My goal is to have an end to end model trained using SGD. The output shape of my final convolutional layer is (8,224,224) using theano dimensions. After this layer, there is softmax.
Now I want to add an LSTM between the final convolutional layer and softmax layer.
I am not sure, what kind of input shape will be for the LSTM network.
I am trying to model a reNet as per this paper:

Any input or suggestion of steps are welcomed.
