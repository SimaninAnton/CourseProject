Here is an example:
x = Input((10,))
layer = Dense(10)
y1 = layer(x)
model1 = Model(input=[x], output=y1)  # this is the model we want to reuse
y2 = model1(y1)  # now model1 is reused, and params should also be shared (right?)
model2 = Model(input=[x], output=y2)
model2.summary()
The output should have been 110, but the output here is 220. The summary counted layers inside model1 twice.
Haven't thought of any bright ideas to solve this problem yet. If something comes up, I would like to code on this issue ;)
