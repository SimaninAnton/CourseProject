Hi, I am trying to use RNN in Keras to do feature selection. I have encountered an issue that "ValueError: Error when checking input: expected lstm_116_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (372, 28)". How to solve this issue? Thanks a lot!

The image is showing how I implement it on Azure Jupyter Notebook Platform. BTW, I encountered the same issue when running it in Win10 Visual Studio.
