Hi,
I found that the input_shape of Embedding layer is inconsistent with the layer's description, where supposedly input_shape should be (nb_samples, sequence_length), but its actual value is (nb_samples, input_dim), and this value is not the true input_shape of input data.
A quick fix would be to change kwargs['input_shape'] = (self.input_dim,) to kwargs['input_shape'] = (self.input_length,) in the layer's init, and it would work fine.
