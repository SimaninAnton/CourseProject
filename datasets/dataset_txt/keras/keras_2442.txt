Hi, thanks for the nice wrapper.
First of all, why do we have to manually set steps_per_epoch and validation_steps everytime we call fit_generator?
Once the generator is specified, can't you just use generator.samples // batch_size ?
Or you can just make None option that specifies it automatically.
Also, what is the correct way to specify it?
generator.samples // batch_size
makes it omit the remainings that is less than batch_size
int(ceil(float(generator.samples) / batch_size))
Possibly this one is correct?
I strongly think the latter with ceiling is the right way to do it, because I could see the remaining batch size (current_batch_size smaller than normal batch size) is shifted every epochs with the former one.
So I guess legacy/interfaces.py should be changed to that code.
Thanks in advanced.
