It would be nice to have additional accuracy measures reported during training. I think callbacks could be used, but I'd prefer to have things like recall, precision, and F1 calculated as part of fit.
However from my perusal of the code, the accuracy measure is fairly entwined in the compile and other code in the model class and, while one could overload a single alternative accuracy calc, it's not straightforward to report more than one or all.
In addition, would be nice to report a few different losses (e.g. MSE and cross entropy) even if only one is used to train.
