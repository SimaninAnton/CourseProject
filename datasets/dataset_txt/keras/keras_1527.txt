I am using model.predict_generator and ImageDataGenerator to predict my image label, my code is as follows:
valid_gen= ImageDataGenerator().flow_from_directory("../input/valid/valid", target_size=(input_size, input_size),shuffle=False, batch_size=1)
pred = model.predict_generator(generator=valid_gen, steps = 1, verbose=1)
actually I put only one image into folder "../input/valid/valid", then I check the predict result, I found it is totally wrong. I test for many images, so I think this is a bug. Anyone got some idea about this?
