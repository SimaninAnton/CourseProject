I run training with history callback
from keras.callbacks import History
history = History()
model.fit_generator(gen(DATAPATH_TR, BATCH_SIZE),samples_per_epoch=ntr, nb_epoch=10, validation_data =gen(DATAPATH_VAL, BATCH_SIZE), nb_val_samples = nval, verbose=1, callbacks = [history])
This outputs correctly (a dictionary) when I do
model.history.history
Then I save the model
model.save('dummy.h5')
Now, in a new python session, I load the model
model = load_model('dummy.h5)
Then when I try to retrieve history callback by typing
model.history.history
It throws an error
AttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'history'
My question is that model.history.history was there before saving the model but why it doesn't exist any more when I load the model? Does it (dropping the model.history.history) happen during model.save() or load_model()?
