Is there additional documentation available on how "activity regularization" differs from "regularization." I'm having trouble finding information in papers/online and I'm curious how they differ.
example: l2 vs activity_l2
Also, I'm assuming W_regularizer refers to weights and b_regularizer refers to bias?
Thanks
