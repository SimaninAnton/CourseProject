Hello,
I would like to implement the Multi task learning approach via keras.
There is a paper with a good explanation: http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs294/f05/papers/caruana-1997.pdf ; pdf-doc-page 4, paper-page 44.
My problem looks like:
My input consist of one data structure with three components:
picture (450x450 px),
label age (1dimensional vector), over 50 or not.
label gender (1dimensional vector), men/women.
It's like the mnist example, but here i have two labels instead of one.
So I have one Input and would like to have two outputs. The neural network reuses the inner layers for common parts, and has a specific part at top.
So I would like to implement this, but I dont know how to build the separate specific parts at top. I would use a mlp or an cnn.
Does anyone have an idea or an code example?
Thanks.
