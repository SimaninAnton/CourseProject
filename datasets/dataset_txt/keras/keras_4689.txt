one quick feature for keras model saving should check if the model was trained in Theano or Tensorflow and standardize the weights. For example we could always save in TH ordering and revert to TF ordering depending on the backend used when the model is loaded.
If nothing else, this entry in the wiki should have a link in the FAQ: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/wiki/Converting-convolution-kernels-from-Theano-to-TensorFlow-and-vice-versa
I noticed that we are starting to get some "hybrid" Keras users with this question
