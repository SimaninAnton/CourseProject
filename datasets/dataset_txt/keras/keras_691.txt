Currently K.clip only works if the minimum and maximum values are python scalars. This is not coherent the numpy behavior since numpy accept arrays as min and max for elementwise clipping. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.clip.html
A PR was made quite some time ago for this but was closed due to inactivity. See #9932 .
If you want to take up this issue, know that you should put a test in the pull request, and also change the documentation accordingly reflecting the new capabilities of K.clip.
