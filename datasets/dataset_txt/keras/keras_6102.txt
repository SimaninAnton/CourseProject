I want to build my own objective function, which need to use the softmax results as the input. I add a function in the objective.py, just follow the function categorical_crossentropy, and it can run.
However, when I directly put the predict softmax result to the objective function, the result is different from the model.fit function. I use the same weight to do the test.
I wonder how the model.fit function compute the loss, is it different from the objective function? Or the input of the objective function is not the softmax results?
