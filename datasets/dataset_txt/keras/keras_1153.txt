Hello,
I am doing a two stream neural netowork where my data are videos and feature vectors. I have got more than 50.000 samples and apart from that I have to do a preprocess. I am using Spyder IDE and when I load 5.000 samples into a matrix it shows that I am close to out of memory ram.
Is there any form to load into a matrix all data without out of memory?
Thanks!!
