I am not very clear about dimension conventions. More specifically:
I found out what 'tf' and 'th' image_dim_ordering conventions were by googling around, but I could not find it in the doc or in the code (keras/backend/common.py). It is (depth, dim1, dim2) for 'th' and (dim1, dim2, depth) for 'tf', right?
If I got it right, I must set my input shape according to that parameter. So for 1d signal (I mostly work with raw audio), depth=1 and I should have the following shape:
'th' convention: (batchsize, 1, dim1, dim2), with one of the dim set to 1
'tf' convention: (batchsize, dim1, dim2, 1), with one of the dim set to 1
Now, on which dim is the convolution applied in Convolution1D? I need to know which dim I must set to 1.
