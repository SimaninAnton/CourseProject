Hi,
Implementation of Convolution1D follows closely that of Convolution2D although the problems are quite different since one is most likely meant for time and the other for images. The way I understand it, if we have a time series and convolve with a 1D filter with N points, the output at time t0 corresponds of overlaying N/2 filter points to what happened prior to t0 and N/2 to filter points what happens after t0 (an acausal filter). The fact that the convolution is centered with the filter is fine for images but for time I think we want the possibility of creating an offset. I think in most cases what we want is for all N points in the filter to be in the past such that the convolution output at time t0 corresponds to overlapping all N filter points to what happened just prior to t0 (causal filter).
Another solution would be to constrain half the filter (or whatever number of points we want) to be zero, but I don't think the 'Constraints' can yet handle this.
I can make the necessary changes but before I do that I'd like to know if this sounds like a good idea, whether there are other suggestions and what approach Francois would prefer.
Thanks
Pablo
