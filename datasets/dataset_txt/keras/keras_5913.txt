This currently raises a NotImplementedError. It looks to me that it would be fairly straightforward to implement. Are there any more complex issues that aren't obvious?
It looks like I can just make the following change to pool2d in theano_backend.py:
    if border_mode == 'same':
        ignore_border = True
        padding = (pool_size[0] - 2, pool_size[1] - 2)
    elif border_mode == 'valid':
        ignore_border = True
        padding = (0, 0)
    else:
        raise Exception('Invalid border mode: ' + str(border_mode))
    ...
I assume that if it was this easy, someone would have done it already, though.
