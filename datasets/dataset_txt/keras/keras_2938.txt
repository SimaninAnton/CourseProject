data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, width, height, channels) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, channels, width, height)
I think channels_last should be (batch, height, width, channels), which is NHWC. And similar to channels_first. There are many places in the help doc like this.

Input shape
3D tensor with shape: (batch_size, steps, input_dim)
The means of steps and input_dim are not clear. I think steps is the length of the time series, input_dim is features in each time step, similar to the channels in Conv2D. Am I right?
