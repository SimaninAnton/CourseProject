get_file has some serious limitations, even with untar=true it can't unzip file.tar it assumes it is a .tar.gz file.
What about changing the parameter from untar to uncompress, and doing something similar to what's discussed in this stackoverflow link for identifying compressed files and uncomrpressing them?
The parameter could be uncompress= and have options None, 'auto', 'tar', 'zip' etc...
Also, the md5 check should be a sha2 check since md5 is known to be insecure.
