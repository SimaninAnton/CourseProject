Stateful rnn requires input_batch_shape = (batch_size, timesteps, nb_features), where batch_size is required for the saving the state. however I am not sure why timesteps is required. it would be beneficial to allow timesteps=None, just as this is possible for stateless rnn having input_shape = (None, nb_features), allowing variable sequence lengths among batches (at least in theano)
usecases:
train batches with short seq. length for truncated BPTT vs. validation batches with full seq. length
train and predict with different seq. lengths (in stateful prediction we may want seq len=1 timestep)
