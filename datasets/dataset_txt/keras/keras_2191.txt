I am getting the error in the title with the following code
Conv1D(filters=num_filters, kernerl_size=fsz, padding='valid', activation='relu', strides=1)(graph_in)
The code worked fine in Keras1 when it was:
Convolution1D(nb_filter=num_filters, filter_length=fsz, border_mode='valid', activation='relu', subsample_length=1)(graph_in)
I have no idea what is wrong with the rewritten version. graph_in is the output of the input layer.
Any advice is appreciated.
