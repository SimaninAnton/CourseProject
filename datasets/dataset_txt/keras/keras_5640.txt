Running an adaptation of the VGG net from the Keras examples page and receiving the following error:
Check failed: input_backprop_index >= 0 && input_backprop_index < num_total_inputs Invalid input backprop index: 8000, -358711296
Dimensions of the input training data are (8144, 1, 128, 128).model_parameters references a python source file. When I set the batch size to 2000 this trains without a problem. When I increase the batch size to 4000 it throws the error. Any obvious reason why? I'm training a network to detect subtle differences between similar object so I'm trying to feed it very large batches and train over a large number of epochs. The bit that says input_backprop_index < num_total_inputs Invalid input backprop index: 8000 seems to imply that there are less than 8000 valid training examples--is the network throwing out data somehow?
