I want to build a convolutional autoencoder where the size of the input in not constant. I'm doing that by stacking up conv-pool layers until I reach an encoding layer, and then doing the reverse with upsample-conv layers. the problem is that no matter what settings I use, I can't get the exact same size in the output layer as the input layer. The reason for that is that the UpSampling layer (given say (2,2) size), doubles the size of the input, so I can't get odd dimensions for instance. Is there a way to tie the output dimension of a given layer to the input dimension of a previous layer for individual samples (as I said, the input size for the max-pool layer in variable)?
