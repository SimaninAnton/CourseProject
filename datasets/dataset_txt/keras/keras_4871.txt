Hi all,
In my text detection application, all I need is a stack of convolution, deconvlution, and pooling layers. In other words, my output shape is the same as the input shape.
The issue here is my training data are of different dimensions, and this cause a problem when I train this network. Of course, I can resize all my training data into a fixed size and then run training, but this setting may cause a problematic aspect ratio. I also tried to train this network by copying network weights and assigning to a newly created network whenever my training data input shape changes. This approach is very expensive in terms of time, because I need to compile a new model for a new input shape every time.
I remembered that older version keras does not require input_shape. Is it possible not to specify input_shape in the current version of keras?
Many thanks
