Hi,
I design a network which composes of shared layers, I write code using functional API. However, there always be errors.
I paste my network structure graph , code , and error information below, hope to provide a clue.
Thanks!
Network Structure:

Share layers:
Embedding is shared among 3 input.(blue color). However, input_length is different for input1/input2 and input3. The input_length for input1/input2 is LSTM_MAXLEN, 1000, for input3 is QUERY_MAXLEN, 5, eg. max 5 words for a query.
CNN feature learning layer is shared between input1 and input2. (green color)
