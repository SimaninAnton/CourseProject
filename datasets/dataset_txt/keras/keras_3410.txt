I don't think travis currently runs mkdocs but please correct me if I'm wrong. At my old job we used to do something like this to make it easier to review changes to documentation. We were on Jenkins but same idea should apply.
Travis can run mkdocs and host the artifacts for any pending PRs. Would make it easy to see if docs are being generated correctly before merging. Would need to configure a reasonable artifact retention time to not run out of memory.
If this is something that sounds useful, lets start a discussion and see what we can do. Any opinions?
Cheers,
Ben
