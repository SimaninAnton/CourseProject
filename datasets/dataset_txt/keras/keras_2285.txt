memory not released bug with tf.python.ops.gen_ctc_ops (both with ctc_greedy_decoder and ctc_beam_search_decoder) ...
import time
from keras import backend as K

start_time = time.time()
while True:
     y_pred  = K.ctc_decode(args)
     cost_time = time.time()-start_time
     print 'cost time', cost_time   # time cost more and more with the same input args. memory cost bigger as well, why ??!! 
#  ...
when using K.ctc_decode() in a large loop, time cost longer loop become larger, why?
please help , thank you!!
