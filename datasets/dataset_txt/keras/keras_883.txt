Hi,
I have run the model in lstm_seq2seq.py, and predict the sequence the with the mdoel online. Now I want to predict the sequence using the model saved in the disk, how can I implement with it?
I have tried the load_model function, but find that the result is not true(just like I have not trained)
Any suggestion would be appreciated
Thanks,
Zhang
