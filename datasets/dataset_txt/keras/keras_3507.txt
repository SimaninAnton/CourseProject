So i have written a network which consists of the followings for multi-class classification : -y_labels transformed with to_categorical -last layer uses a sigmoid function with 3 neurons as my classes -model compile uses categorical_crossentropy as loss function So i used
model.predict_classes(x_test)
and then i used it as
classification_report(y_test,pred)
y_test has the form to_categorical And i am getting the following error :
ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types set(['binary', 'multilabel-indicator'])
My question is how can i transform it back in order to use it as such?
