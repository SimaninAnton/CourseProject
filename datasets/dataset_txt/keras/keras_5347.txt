Hi,
I have a case where I want to combine an (integer) embedded feature and real-valued feature or provide them as two separate inputs to a RNN. Following is my example:
a = Input(shape=(1,), dtype='int32') #Integer classes feature to be embedded
b =  Input(shape=(1,), dtype='float32') #real-valued feature
em = Embedding(output_dim=10,input_dim=20,input_length=1) (a) #20 classes for integer feature
I want to pass both features to RNN layer. Is it possible to do so and how? I am aware of the merge layer but it seems directly apply merge to b and em does not help. I do not want the real valued feature to be embedded.
Please let me know if there is workaround or if I need to write a new layer for this.
Thanks
