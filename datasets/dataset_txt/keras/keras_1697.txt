Hello!
Just a little issue with the documentation, which can be misleading: The documentation about the model.fit function (and analogously the model.generator_fit function) tells us:
epochs: integer, the number of epochs to train the model.
initial_epoch: epoch at which to start training (useful for resuming a previous training run)
I understood that this code starts at epoch 15 and goes on to epoch 25:
model.fit(x, epochs=10, initial_epoch=15)
What happens instead is that the model isnt fitted at all, the as the parameter epochs is understood is "final_epochs" or "total_epochs". As the initial_epoch is bigger that the "final_epoch", it simply never starts.
The same happens if I write
model.fit(x, epochs=100, initial_epoch=15)
In that case the model is trained until epoch 100, not for 100 epochs.
I think the documentation is slightly misleading and see two solution to fix this:
Convince me that I'm the only person who misunderstood this
Make the documentation more verbose.
If the consensus goes for the latter, I can try to fix it myself.
