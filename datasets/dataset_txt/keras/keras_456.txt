If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or on the Keras Slack channel instead of opening a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hello,
When I create a model and then rename its layers (by setting the.name attribute) and then plot it, the plot becomes corrupted (the layers are plotted side by side without any connection). I guess this is due to the reason, that Keras relies on the names of layers to connect them and renaming breaks this(?).
Is there any way, to rename my layers without messing up the model?
Saving the model summary as a .txt file seems to work btw.
Here is some code
    input = Input(shape=(128, 128, 3))
    x = input
    for i in range(10):
        x = Conv2D(10, kernel_size=(3,3), name="layer{}".format(i))(x)
    model = Model(input, outputs=x, name="decoder")
    model.compile(optimizer='nadam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    from keras.utils import plot_model

    outpath = "./test1.png"
    plot_model(model, show_shapes=True, to_file=outpath)
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer.name = "1" + layer.name

    outpath = "./test2.png"

    plot_model(model, show_shapes=True, to_file=outpath)
Edit:
Looking into the plot function (keras.utils.vis_utils) shows that this is due to the fact that model._network_nodes is not updated
