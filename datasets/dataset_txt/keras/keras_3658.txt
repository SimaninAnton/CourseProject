in lstm_benchmark.py, I find to define a LSTM: LSTM(embedding_dim, dropout_W=0.2, dropout_U=0.2, consume_less=mode)
But how can I define the hidden output size of if, i.e. how can I define the second dimension of the weights? I do look all the examples and some of the source codes, but I did not find out. Can you explain a little bit for me?
