Hello,
I am using keras with tensorflow
('keras: ', '1.1.0')
('Tensorflow: ', '0.10.0')
I am able to build a ConvNet model using
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
I think my model defnition doesn't have problem.
BUT when I tried to train the model with
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=nb_epoch,verbose=1, validation_split=0.2)
the ipython notebook is crashing. any help?
