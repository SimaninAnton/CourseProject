I'm here asking for a very good model that would be nice to have on Keras: VGG-Face.
Paper: Deep Face recognition, Parkhi, O. M., Vedaldi, A. and Zisserman, A. 2015, British Machine Vision Conference (Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 6).

Maybe a alternative version using VGG19 would be nice too (VGG-Face uses VGG-16).
