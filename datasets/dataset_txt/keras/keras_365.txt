About this example:
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_seq2seq.py
I saw there is already a model.save() in line 154, so I just inserted this line before train.fit in order to resume a previously saved model:
model = load_model('s2s.h5')
but when I do that, the model always returns gibberish outputs like this:
Input sentence: Come on!
Decoded sentence: ëc.PyéaççNnçbbSyNéwççCCnjmmyéVwçÀ8YéaççbbybSNSNwSVwççCCjv%%)
It breaks after save/load.
Before doing any save/load outputs are fine. What am I missing? Maybe I shouldn't load as simple as that?
