When i add 'stateful' to LSTM, I get following Exception: If a RNN is stateful, a complete input_shape must be provided (including batch size).
Based on other threads #1125 #1130 I am using the option of "batch_input_shape" yet i am getting the error.
I raised the same in forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/keras-users/nwB3ilYY4ZQ
but no response
you can find my complete code here:
