This may be intentional, but the Keras setup.py install requires 'keras_applications==1.0.4',
see: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/setup.py#L40
keras-applications version 1.0.5 is out (and is auto-installed when you install tensorflow==1.11.0rc0 because it requires >=1.0.5).
The issue appears because I'm installing keras and tensorflow with pipenv which can't create a lock file because of incompatible requirements:
Could not find a version that matches keras-applications==1.0.4,>=1.0.5
This is not a big problem -- everything works on my end, but I thought it might not have been intentional to make the requirement == rather than >=
