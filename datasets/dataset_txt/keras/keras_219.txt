feature suggestion:
K.abs() allows you to include a differentiable version of K.max() and K.min().
This is easy because, for scalars a and b, we have:
max(a, b) = .5*( a + b + |a - b |)
similarly,
min(a, b) = .5*( a + b - |a - b| )
Also, a differentiable switch on the sign of a scalar value b can be implemented as:
(1 + b/|b|) / 2 or (1 - b/|b|) / 2
