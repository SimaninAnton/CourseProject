The image data generator image.py fails when I tried to train a single input and multiple output model with data augmentation by saying 'the shape of X and y must be the same.
But, for multiple output model, I supply a list of ndarrays and since the input is a single input, I supplied just X as is ndarray. I locally fixed it by checking to see if y is a list and bypass the exception and it works just fine.
