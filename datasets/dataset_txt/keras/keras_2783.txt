I have X have dimension: (30,3) x: [[1.2, 0.2, 0.6],[0.6, 0, 0.9],....[0.6, 0, 0.8]] and y just [0,1,0, .1], i read about sequence to sequence with keras in this post :https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html, but i can't understand ( in Sequence-to-sequence autoencoder). I think i need use TimeDistributed layer in keras for X then use this to input for LSTM ( many to many), sry about question, but i try read to much, but can't clear to understand how resolve my problem.
