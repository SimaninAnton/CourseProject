I have been trying to write a CropAndEltwiseSum method in Keras. The method must crop a tensor x to match dimensions of ref tensor and then perform an element-wise summation. However, this is causing an issue since my input to the model is of type (3, None, None). So using x.shape and ref.shape for cropping the appropriate layer before summation breaks the code. Is there a work-around this issue?
