In the documentation of the Conv1D layer, it is said about the padding causal option,
"causal" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. output[t] depends solely on input[:t-1]
But from the code we can that see that output[t] always depend on input[t]. Maybe we can say that
"causal" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. output[t] does not depends on input[t+1:]
