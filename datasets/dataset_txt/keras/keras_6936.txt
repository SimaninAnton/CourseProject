Extending on from the work on the test refactor, I have created a configuration file for 'travis ci'. Think of it as free Jenkins for open source projects. It requires adding a .travis.yml file to the repository, then for Francois to go set up the account at travis-ci. I have proven it works by setting Travis up to look at my fork, so I can do a merge request if this is seen as beneficial.
This is useful to the package maintainers as they can see as soon as anyone breaks the build, plus it is also a statement to the public of greater reliability.
In order to make it really mean something, more work will need to be done on the test coverage, this is just mechanics.
