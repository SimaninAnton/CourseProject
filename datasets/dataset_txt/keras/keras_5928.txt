I want to predict sequences of number vectors based on the previous ones. I have five sequences. I considered the length of the history 100. I transformed the data to following format:
As an input X I have array of n matrices, each with 100 rows and 5 columns (technically, X is a tensor with dimensions n x 100 x 5). The target y will be matrix n x 5 - for each input X_i (matrix 100 x 5) I want one corresponding row of y (with just two elements). So my input data (X) is a numpy array n x 100 x 5 and output (y) is n x 5.
Can anybody help me how to have a feed-forward NN without hidden layer. Indeed I want to have the output in this way:
