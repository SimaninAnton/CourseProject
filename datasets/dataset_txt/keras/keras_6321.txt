Hello,
I'm building an end-to-end network to produce a pixelwise probability map of the input images. The input images (500x300x3) have pixelwise labels (500x300) indicating which class each pixel is belonging to.
The data and label are defined as follows:
    img_height = 300
    img_width  = 500
    data = np.empty((num_images, 3, img_height, img_width), dtype="float32")
    label = np.empty((num_images, img_height, img_width), dtype="uint8")
I want to use cross entropy as the loss, could anyone suggest a way of implement this using Keras? Thanks in advance!
