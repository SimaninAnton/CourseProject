Hi guys,
I have a question, not sure if here is the right place to ask. I apologize if not.
I'm wondering what is the best solution to work on the following problem: imagine you have a signal class and multiple background classes. Would be better to train a Keras network using categorical classification or using a binnary one (for that one needs to consider all background classes as one merged)? Also, consider that each background class (as well signal) has different amount of examples. So, if one use all background example together would Keras learn less about the classes which have less example than the others?
