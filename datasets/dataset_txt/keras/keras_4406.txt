Given the positive response to including Polyak averaging/EMA in Keras, I wonder if Keras should have a roadmap of things that would be good to implement, and maybe a rough description of where they should be implemented?
Obviously some things are going to be use-case specific, but it also might help people learn more about what things are even out there.
