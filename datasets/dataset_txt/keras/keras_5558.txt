Using data augmentation can augment data if there isn't enough data. I see ImageDataGenerator is achievable, but the document is not very detailed. I run the example cifar10_cnn.py, and I'm also not clear about how to use it. Beside, I don't see any different between using ImageDataGenerator and not. Who can tell how to use it. Thank you very much!!
