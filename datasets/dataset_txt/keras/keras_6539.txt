There should be a simple mechanism for reversing the order of Keras neural networks. So if you have input X and output Y, you could completely reverse the network and have input Y and output X; keeping the optimized weights.
It might be helpful for hyperparameter optimization to see the neural network's idea of various targets. For instance, in classifying MNIST digits you could get an idea of how the neural network perceives various digits.
