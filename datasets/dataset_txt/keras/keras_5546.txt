As inception style networks uses I like to branch a layer's output and merge at the end of the next layer. I implemented that by the following snippet but I got DisconnectedInputError
    # model is defined previously as the last layers output
    # conv 3x3
    left = Sequential()
    left = ConvFactory(left, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), num_filter=ch_3x3,
                      input_shape = model.output_shape[1:])
    # pool
    right = Sequential()
    right.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2),
             input_shape = model.output_shape[1:]))

    model.add(layers.Merge([left, right], mode='concat',concat_axis=1))
