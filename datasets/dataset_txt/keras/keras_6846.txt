I installed keras with pip and I'm having an issue trying to create a Graph model:
In [1]: from keras.models import Graph
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-74d2d1fd7bad> in <module>()
----> 1 from keras.models import Graph

ImportError: cannot import name 'Graph'
The version I have installed is 0.1.1. Do you guys have any idea what is happening?
