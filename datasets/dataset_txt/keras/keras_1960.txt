I've managed to finish experiments using attention mechanism adopted from @cbaziotis implementation and now i'm confused with the visualization. I don't really understand the heatmap as well. If you guys can explain these to me, it means a lot :
What is heatmap? how to read them?
What to visualize in an attention mechanism? The weight?
The code to visualize an attention mechanism, in conjunction to @cbaziotis' implementation
Thanks in advance!
