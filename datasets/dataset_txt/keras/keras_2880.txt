I want to replicate the following model, a hierarhical reccurent encoder-decoder:
The decoder input is a vector of indexes which are fed to an embedding layer. My question is, how can i concatenate the context output with each timestamp from the decoder input embeddings but only on the timestamps which are not zero padded. Is my approach correct, or should I simply keep the context as the first timestamp in the decoder RNN without concatenating the context's features with every timestamp's features? The paper which describes the model is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04808.pdf
