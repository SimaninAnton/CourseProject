I'm trying to train a image captioning model as described in keras example https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/. How to get the caption for a new test image ? How should I give the test data and get a entire caption for the image ?
As the last layer in the example is "Dense", it would give a single prediction but how do I get the entire caption ?
Could someone please help in solving this. Thanks in advance.
