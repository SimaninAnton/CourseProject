Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
In order to reproduce the error you just need to update the test test_initializations.py:
replace:
CONV_SHAPE = (25, 25, 2, 2)
with:
# TH kernel shape: (depth, input_depth, ...)
# TF kernel shape: (..., input_depth, depth)
if (K.image_dim_ordering() == 'tf'):
    CONV_SHAPE = (2, 2, 25, 25)
else:
    CONV_SHAPE = (25, 25, 2, 2)
the th conv shape comment was taken from keras/test_initializations.py file.
Now if you will try to run the test in tf mode it will fail.
I found out about this issue when a net I created converged only in th mode, when I tried to figure why I found that the initialization was wrong in tf mode.
I also had pull request to fix it which was closed:
#4842
Any thoughts? Am I looking at this all thing wrong?
