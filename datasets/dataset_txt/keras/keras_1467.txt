I have a dataset of 100000 rows and 30 features. This is a classification problem. Since there is a dependence of ith feature vector on previous feature vectors, I wish to use LSTM for this classification. I want to use a timestep of 5. So, when I am using X=np.reshape(X, (100000, 5, 30)), I am getting an error that "cannot reshape array of size 3000000 into shape (100000,5,30)".
Am I correct with my data formulation for the LSTM. Why am I getting errors when reshaping the X dataset?
