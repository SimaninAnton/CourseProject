Hello, I'm trying to figure out how can I use an RNN (Bidirectional LSTM) to learn the embedding of a sequence of words, like described in [1]. Their model outperforms the accuracy of Doc2Vec model.
I tried to follow the Autoencoders tutorial on Keras Blogs, but my loss in incredibly down. Anyone has an example of how can I learn the Sentence Embedding with Keras? This is possible?
