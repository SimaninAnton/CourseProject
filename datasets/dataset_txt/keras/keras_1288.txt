Hi, I used config = model.get_config() to get model config and insert it into a mysql table. When I select it from mysql table I can get and print it out as a list (inside is dictionary format). However, when I tried to re-instantiate it using model = Model.from_config(config) or model = Sequential.from_config(config). I got error as below.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "testcallmodel.py", line 48, in
model_id=args.mi,
File "testcallmodel.py", line 32, in call
model = Sequential.from_config(config)
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/models.py", line 1348, in from_config
return cls.legacy_from_config(config)

first_layer = normalize_legacy_config(first_layer)
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/models.py", line 1397, in normalize_legacy_config
class_name = conf['name']
TypeError: string indices must be integers
While the config that I can print out look like this. Sorry that I did not show all the config here. But I think you can figure out if it is a bug or not.
config: [{'class_name': 'LSTM', 'config': {'kernel_initializer': {'class_name': 'VarianceScaling', ..........................................'bias_constraint': None, 'use_bias': True, 'kernel_constraint': None, 'activity_regularizer': None, 'trainable': True, 'name': 'dense_2', 'bias_initializer': {'class_name': 'Zeros', 'config': {}}, 'bias_regularizer': None}}]
Many thanks!
