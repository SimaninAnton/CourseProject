Hi, what is the best approach to export a trained convolutional neural model (i.e. matrices with weights) in Keras for use in another tool? Does it also depend on the backend used (Theano or TensorFlow)?
(The tool I am talking about is DeepLearningKit (http://deeplearningkit.org) - that will be opensourced now in December)
Best regards,
