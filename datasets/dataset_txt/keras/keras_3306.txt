When I add an LSTM with
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense 
from keras.layers import LSTM

look_back = 1 
batch_size = 1 
model = Sequential()  
model.add(LSTM(4, batch_input_shape=(batch_size, look_back, 1), stateful=True, return_sequences=True))
I get an error
TypeError: Expected int32, got <tensorflow.python.ops.variables.Variable object at 0x2e753d0> of type 'Variable' instead.
This did not happen with the previous version of tensorflow.
