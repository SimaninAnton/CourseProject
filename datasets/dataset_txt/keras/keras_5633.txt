Is it possible to pass additional arguments (**kvargs) to a custom objective function?
Specifically I'd like the mse to also maximize the difference between two different target outputs, i.e. something like:
def interference_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred, other_y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true) - K.square(y_true - other_y_pred) , axis=-1)
