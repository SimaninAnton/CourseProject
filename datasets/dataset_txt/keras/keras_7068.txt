Since many experiments can take a while and will be running on an environment where the user does not have a lot of control (e.g., a shared cluster), it would be interesting to have interrupt handlers to do something in case the operating system sends a signal to kill the process during the execution of the fit method. Blocks does this by using the signal module (which is part of the standard library). That way, you can save the current model state (using pickle, for example) before letting the OS kill your process. Would you be interested in adding something similar to the fit method in model.py?
