Hello everyone using Keras, I am new to Keras and I love it.
However, I got a confusing problem when run kreas on GPU.
I found even after hundreds of epochs, the loss value stays
still (and even increase in some case). However, when run on
CPU ONLY, it decreased. So it is not the problem of overflow
(at least I think so). Is there any idea / solutions / hints for the
problem ? I tried to run it on GPU Titan X and Tesla K40c.
Thank you all in advance.
