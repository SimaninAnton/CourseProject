Hi,
I have been going through the latest the LSTM model for the text generation example from Andrej Kaparthy. It's pretty cool and works pretty well. Now, I am wondering if the LSTM model by Junhua Mao (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6632) can be supported easily. The reason i am asking this is the duplication of an embedding layer before the RNN (figure2). I guess one can use the RepeatVector, but I havent seen enough examples to be sure. So some clarification will be helpful.
Thanks! Keras rocks!
