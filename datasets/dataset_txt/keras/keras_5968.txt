Hello,
I attempted training a covnet. Since it takes a long time, I figured something might happen with the computer and it might crash at some point, and it did. I did include the ModelCheckpoint callback so weights are saved in a .hdf5 file. Unfortunately, only a quarter of epochs passed and I would like to continue training the network.
I saw an answer on stackoverflow which says that I should define the layers as I would when beginning (passing the init='something') and after that loading the weights but it confuses me - wouldn't init and load_weights counteract each other?
I'm still new to this so would you mind giving me an example of loading weights from such file and initializing a network with it to continue training? I would not bother you but I didn't quite find the documentation helpful.
Thank you in advance!
