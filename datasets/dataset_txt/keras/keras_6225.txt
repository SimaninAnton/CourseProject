Hello there,
I have multiple photos that show different angles of a specific objects and I was hoping to use a CNN as the feature extractor and an LSTM as the classifier so that I can enter for example a sequence of 40 photos and get as an output the room label. How can I do this with keras? I have a problem with the connection between the LSTM and the CNN. Should I use a time distributed dense? Please let me know if keras can help with this. So that I can go and implement something in tensorflow if not.
