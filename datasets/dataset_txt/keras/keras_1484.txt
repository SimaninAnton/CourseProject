Currently I have bunch of 16bit color image as training set. (So each RGB channel is 16 bit not 8 bit)
I know flow_from_directory use PIL as its backend and PIL possibly can read 16bit grey image. But I'm not sure it can read 16bit color image.
Currently flow_from_directory read image as 8 bit. So it shrink 16bit to 8bit and give it to me.
I've searched quite a lot of examples but couldn't find right answer.
Is there any idea?
