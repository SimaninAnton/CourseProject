Hello,
I'm having troubles to understand whether something is possible for such example:
For instance I have two different feature sets (A & B) and I want to use CNN for A and LSTM for B and combine their learned representations before feeding it to FC layer. Is it possible and how do I do it with Keras? Should I use two different fit functions? But then how do I use predict?
model.fit(train_A, trainY)
model.fit(train_B, trainY)
I'm really confused about this architecture, I'd appreciate it a lot if you guide me or even refer some reading material.
Thanks in advance!
