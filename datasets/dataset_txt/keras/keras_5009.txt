Wanted to open an issue because I've started playing around with an implementation of this. Currently working through some issues with theano: Theano/Theano#4597.
My approach is to attempt to mimic the context manager API used in TF, so that we would be able to implement them both transparently and provide a unified interface. This looks like it should work; it's mostly a matter of resolving issues with theano at the moment.
If anyone else has had any success with this let me know?
