The documentation is badly rendered for flow_from_dataframe. See https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/.
This needs to be modified in keras-team/preprocessing in this file: https://github.com/keras-team/keras-preprocessing/blob/052eb78390f91bb1628c59a8b678324f68f9a2b4/keras_preprocessing/image.py
Also, a link is given as plain string it would be nice to have it as a hyperlink so that users can click on it.
To be clear, the pull request fixing this should not be opened on this repo, but on this repo: https://github.com/keras-team/keras-preprocessing
