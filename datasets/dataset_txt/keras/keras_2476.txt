I have 3000 gray images and I want to convert it to a dataset that has the same format as the MNIST data set to use with keras theano backend. Basically, I'd like to be able to take the MNIST code but different images and labels, and run that code. I haven't found any information on how to do this online, and am completely new to machine learning and python.
