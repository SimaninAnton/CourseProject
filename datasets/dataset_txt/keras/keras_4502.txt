Hi,
Let's say I have two tensors(let's name them A and B) by size of None,10,200 and I want to get the cosine similarity of corresponding rows of these two tensors and get a None, 10 tensor.
What do you suggest me to do? The merge function gives me a single number and I couldn't run merge function through the Timedistributed function.
Anybody had the same situation?
What do you suggest me to do?
I appreciate any help. Thanks.
