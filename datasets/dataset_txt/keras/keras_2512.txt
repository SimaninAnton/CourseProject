Hi, I wonder is that possible to reshape a keras tensor along a sample axis? For example, something looks like
from keras.layers import Input
from keras.layers.core import Reshape

input_shape = (5,32,32,1) # the batch size is 5
tensor = Input(batch_shape=input_shape)
new_tensor = Reshape((1,)+tensor._keras_shape)(tensor) # the new tensor should be (1,5,32,32,1)
I have a bug when trying the above code: ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
It seems that keras does not allow to change the size of sample axis, it this true? Is there any solution to this problem?
Thanks!
