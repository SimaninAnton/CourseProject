When padding mode is causal, the ouput at time t only relies on the input before t.
Dilation rate means how many steps before the next filtering on the convolution surface. However what does the kernel size imply for in convolution process? Does it has relationship to the time step? Is there an intuitive understanding of kernel size in causal dilated convolution?
