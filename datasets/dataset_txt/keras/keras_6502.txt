Hey there,
I've been trying to connect a Dense layer to the LSTM which should be after it. The code below shows what I mean more concretely.
qrnn = Sequential()
qrnn.add(Dense(512, input_dim=X.shape[1]))
qrnn.add(Dropout(0.5))
qrnn.add(LSTM(512, return_sequences=True))
qrnn.add(Dropout(0.2))
qrnn.add(LSTM(512, return_sequences=False))
But I get this error
Incompatible shapes: layer expected input with ndim=3 but previous layer has output_shape (None, 512)
