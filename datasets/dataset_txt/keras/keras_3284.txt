WARNING (theano.sandbox.cuda): The cuda backend is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Please switch to the gpuarray backend. You can get more information about how to switch at this URL:

theano is going to switch from cuda to gpuarray, the api may have some changes, will we support this change?
