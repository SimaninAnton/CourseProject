I've found a way to subtract two tensors in Keras:
input0 = Input(shape=(1, 512, 512)) layer_1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input0) layer_2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(layer_1) diff = merge([layer_1, layer_2], mode=lambda x: x[0] - x[1], output_shape=lambda x: x[0])
But it looks like the merge function is being deprecated by the end of month. Are there ways with the new Merge Layers to perform subtraction?
