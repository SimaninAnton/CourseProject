The newly introduced packages keras-preprocessing and keras-applications lead to cyclic-dependencies warnings in pipdeptree:
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
C:\Users\me>pipdeptree
Warning!! Cyclic dependencies found:
* Keras => keras-preprocessing => Keras
* Keras => keras-applications => Keras
* Keras-Preprocessing => keras => Keras-Preprocessing
* Keras-Applications => keras => Keras-Applications
...
This causes Keras and its dependencies to be hidden in the pipdeptree output. I just spent half an hour figuring out why pyYAML was updated in my system, although I had never installed it and pipdeptree did not list it at all (pipdeptree --all finally did).
