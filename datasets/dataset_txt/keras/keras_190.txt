This is python model which is working good in python:
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples
lstm_seq2seq.py Trains a basic character-level sequence-to-sequence model.
lstm_seq2seq_restore.py Restores a character-level sequence to sequence model from disk (saved by lstm_seq2seq.py) and uses it to generate predictions.
Do you know if there is way to convert to java?
