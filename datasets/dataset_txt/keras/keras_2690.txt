When loading a model with a Lambda layer, Keras throws the error TypeError: arg 5 (closure) must be tuple. But after implementing the changes outlined in explosion/spaCy#767 (comment), load_model() works as expected.
The issue is with edae178#diff-56dc3cc42e1732fdb3a3c2c3c8efa32a. This commit removes func_reconstruct_closure(), but when I added that back in and called it in func_load(), it works.
Is there a fix planned for this?
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
