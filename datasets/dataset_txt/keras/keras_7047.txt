Hi, fchollet
I just spend several hours reading the documentation, looking through the example cifar10_cnn.py, and I find it really easy to use keras. But as shown in the title, I am confused by these two question:
how to get the output of the convolution layer? I want to visualize the feature map after each convolution layer. Although it is not so important, I need this when writing paper. Any other methods of this framework?
I want to use CNN as feature extractor, so the output of the fully connected layer should be saved. It seems that keras do not support?
Thanks!
