Hi,
Is there a way to use Keras to output a sequence from a sequence of sequence?
Concretely, with a bunch of vectorized sentences...
[0, 0, 0, 85, 111, 2, 409, ... , 4322, 4008]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 89, 112, ... , 6185, 215]
...
... labeled for multiclass classification ...
[0, 0, 0, 1]
[0, 1, 0, 0]
...
... and using an example from the documentation, it's easy to build a good predictive model.
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max_features, 128))
model.add(LSTM(128, 128))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(128, 4))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', class_mode="categorical")
However, would it be possible to predict a sequence of label from a sequence of sentences?
Maybe we could use Convolution2D layer but I struggle to make it work.
Any suggestion on how to implement that would be greatly appreciated :)
Best
