I am new to Keras; I was building my first conv net model when I had issue of connecting a Conv2D layer with a Dense layer. I was unable to find much helpful information on google / here, and spent close to 30m tinkering. So to help others with same problem here is the solution I got:
model=Sequential()
model.add(Convolution2D(8, 5, 5, border_mode='same',subsample=(2,2),input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
#output shape is (nsamples, 14, 14 ,8)
model.add(Convolution2D(8, 5, 5, border_mode='same',subsample=(2,2)))
#output shape is (nsamples, 7, 7 ,8)
model.add(Reshape((7 * 7 * 8 , )))
model.add(Dense(output_dim=256))
There is no problem I need help with now :) thanks for this library enjoying it.
