Hi all,
I just ran the unit tests. There are a significant number of failures at the moment.

One of the failures is the result of h5py not being included the setup.py for keras. Others appear to be 'real' failures (bad training scores).
Do others experience the same failures? I'm seeing similar failures on my travis-ci setup which is running Ubuntu (I'm on OSX). There are some extra passing tests there which Thomas and I have been working on.
If others have the tests passing, then it's likely to be an environmental issue.
If so, that might be an indication there is an issue with code being committed. This could be a good motivation to look at setting up travis on the main repository to confirm changes are moving in the right direction.
