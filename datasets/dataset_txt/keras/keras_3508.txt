I have an architecture which is very similar to the one posted here.
It works fine without masking. But it throws following error with masking:
Exception: Layer xyz does not support masking, but was passed an input_mask: All{0}.0
Essentially, I am using Flatten and Reshape layer, which does not support masking, which results in above mentioned error.
I have been stuck on this issue for quite some time and would appreciate any help on this.
