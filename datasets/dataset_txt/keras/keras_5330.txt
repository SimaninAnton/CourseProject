When running mkdocs build on a up to date Keras repo (c9f7d97) following the instructions in docs/README.md the following error happens:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '[..]/keras/docs/sources/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers.md'
In addition, there could be a small error in the example in http://keras.io/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers/:
super(Layer, self).__init__(**kwargs) is supposed to be super(mylayer, self).__init__(**kwargs) on line 7 in function __init__.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
