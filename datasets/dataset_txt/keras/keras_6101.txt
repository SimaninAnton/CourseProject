I am trying to implement my own code to feed in data batch-to-batch in memory: for each epoch, training process will get through all the batches. Each batch is iteratively drawn from some generator.
My question is that: since python generator can only be iterated through all elements once (no problem for one epoch), how can we make it happen if this generator is applied for multiple epoches? Thanks
