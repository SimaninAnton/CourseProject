Does Keras provide a way to get the output of a nested model? Or is there a way to flatten the nested model?
x2 = layer1(x1, name='layer1')
x3 = layer2(x2, name='layer2')
m1 = Model(x1, x3)
x5 = layer3(x4, name='layer3')
x6 = TimeDistributed(m1)(x5)
m2 = Model(x5, x4)
For the model architecture below, how can I 'get layer1' or 'layer2'? When I compile m2, I only see 'layer3' and the TimeDistributed layer.
