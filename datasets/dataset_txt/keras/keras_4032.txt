I have been trying to replicate the recent work on networks with dynamic topology. The only available implementations for Neural Module Networks have been using Jacob Andreas's fork of ApolloCaffe and I am wondering if this is possible within Keras.
For example, in a VQA setting, the idea is to have a set of simple primitive "module" networks that are composed at query time to answer a specific question. The manner in which the network is composed and thus it's topology is conditioned on the given query.They use REINFORCE to select the best network architecture from a set of candidate architectures. The slides give some intuition on how it is done and the paper details the approach.
So given a question, the goal is to predict a network architecture (from a set of primitive modules) and use that network to predict an answer.
Is any of this possible within Keras?
It would probably require weight-tying across different instantiations of a primitive network module and continuosly modifying the computation graph.
