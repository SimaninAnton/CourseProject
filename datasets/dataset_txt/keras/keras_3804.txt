It looks to me like the number of filters in a net is fixed upon compilation. If I want to add or remove filters as training progresses, how can you do that after the net is compiled? Or do you have to get the network outputs, do the calcs, and then recompile for every single input during training? That would be really slow. For example, let's say I start with a convlayer of 30 filters and I find that I want to add 5 more during training, how do I do that please?
