I have a huge dataset of images which are fetched by the Keras Generator and it seems the generator uses PIL to read and resize the images.
The generator asks for a target_size to be given which has a default value of [256,256].
I'd like to remove the overhead of resizing the images when the generator is fetching them, so I wanted to know if it would help to resize the images once offline and then use the generator to read the files (hopefully without the overhead)?
Would the Generator ignore resizing the images once it checks that the target_size is the same as the image dimensions?
