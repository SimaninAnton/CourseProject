Hi Fellows,
thanks for making Keras so great!
For reinforcement learning, I would need to accumulate the gradients of the neural network with different sets of input parameters. How can I access the gradients in Keras?
I need two things:
I need to aggregate the gradients over different sets of X, I do not want to run full backprop at this stage.
In a second stage, I only want to run the backprop with the gradients from 1. I can not do this in the same batch, since 1 and 2 need to run on two different neural networks (of the same topology).
I am using Theano backend, and I am willing to program. Can you give me some hints on where to look? For a first test, I would rather not use GPUs, if this matters.
Thanks and kind regards
Ernst
