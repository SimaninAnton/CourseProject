When I using keras by theano,
import keras
Using Theano backend.
Using gpu device 0: GeForce GTX 1080 (CNMeM is enabled with initial size: 10.0% of memory, cuDNN 5105)
/home/lt/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/theano/sandbox/cuda/init.py:600: UserWarning: Your cuDNN version is more recent than the one Theano officially supports. If you see any problems, try updating Theano or downgrading cuDNN to version 5.

The GPU can work well!
But now I switch tensorflow,
import keras
Using TensorFlow backend.(Just it !)
and when I run the demo, GPU doesn't work! Is keras can use GPU automatically when using tensorflow backend?
