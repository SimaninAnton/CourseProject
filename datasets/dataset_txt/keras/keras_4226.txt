When with newly keras, Theano and Tensorflow, the Norm. ED of image_ocr is 0.577(TF)/0.622(TH) after 50 epoch. But the performance listed in this file is:
Norm. ED
Epoch | TF | TH
10   0.072    0.272
20   0.032    0.115
30   0.024    0.098
40   0.023    0.108
Is there anything wrong with the codes? Or how to replicate the results? Thanks.
