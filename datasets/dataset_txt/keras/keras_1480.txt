Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
just copy the script here if it is short
print(np_utils.to_categorical([3]))

[ 0.  0.  0.  1.]

print(np_utils.to_categorical([3, 3]))

[[ 0.  0.  0.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1.]]
to_categorical documentation says "Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix."
When a single element is provided, it outputs a vector, why this anomaly? It should still output a matrix just as the documentation specified (and it is the intuitive behavior).
