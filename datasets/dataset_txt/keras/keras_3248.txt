Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
`
#This model.input is a four head placeholder with size (3, 227, 227)
input_imgs = model.input
loss = K.max(layer_dict[layer_name].output[p[0]])

# compute the gradient of the input picture wrt this loss
grads = K.gradients(loss, input_imgs)[0]

# this function returns the loss and grads given the input picture
iterate = K.function(input_imgs, [grads])

I want to compute gradients for a siamese NN with fout head inputs, but when i apply the above K function I get a tensor of gradient with shape (1, 3, 227, 227), when what I want is (4, 3, 227, 227).
What can I do to get the correct gradients.
