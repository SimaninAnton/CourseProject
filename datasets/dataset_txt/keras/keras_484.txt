The title pretty much says it all, when you use model.fit with ReduceLRonPlateau or without it along with the Tensorboard callback, Keras writes the learning rate by epoch to Tensorboard, but if you LearningRateScheduler, it doesn't ? Is there any particular reason for this ? Its technically not a bug, but its very unexpected behavior.
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
