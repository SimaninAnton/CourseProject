Hi everyone,
I'm trying to load a saved model which has been trained with a custom stateful metric (object of the class ValidAccuracy using the code
dependencies = {
     'ValidAccuracy': ValidAccuracy
}
model = keras.models.load_model(model_file, custom_objects=dependencies)
and I get the error
ValueError: Unknown metric function: {'config': {'batch_size': 32, 'name': 'valid_accuracy', 'trainable': False}, 'class_name': <class 'spearec.run.metrics.ValidAccuracy'>}.
Is there any solution or workaround?
