Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I tried the code given here: #2295
I am unable to load my model after training it. I am getting the following error:
ValueError: Optimizer weight shape (3, 3, 512, 512) not compatible with provided weight shape (256, 43)
I tried the solution here: #3964 using HDFView and deleting the optimiser weights and then reloading. But then I get the error:
ValueError: ('shapes (10,4224) and (1128,256) not aligned: 4224 (dim 1) != 1128 (dim 0)', (10, 4224), (1128, 256))
Apply node that caused the error: Dot22(Reshape{2}.0, lstm_2_W_i)
Toposort index: 249
Inputs types: [TensorType(float32, matrix), TensorType(float32, matrix)]
Inputs shapes: [(10, 4224), (1128, 256)]
Inputs strides: [(16896, 4), (1024, 4)]
Inputs values: ['not shown', 'not shown']
Outputs clients: [[Elemwise{Add}[(0, 0)](Dot22.0, InplaceDimShuffle{x,0}.0)]]
I also tried the solution by barrykui here: #4044 saving the architecture to JSON and saving weights separately and then loading but even that fails.
