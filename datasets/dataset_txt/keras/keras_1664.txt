Hi,
I trained a model with inputs input_1 (InputLayer) (None, 1440, 1440, 3) and batches of size 3 (because of the images dimensions), and I saved it.
When I load the model to test it and ask the same image data generator to generate the same type of batches, I get the following error from the method predict_on_batch: ValueError: Error when checking : expected input_1 to have shape (None, 1440, 1440, 3) but got array with shape (3, 1400, 1400, 3)
Any idea why during the training I can give arrays/batches of dimensions (3, 1400, 1400, 3) but not during the testing?
