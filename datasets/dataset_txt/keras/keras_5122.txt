Looking at https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py#L1226 (fit_generator), I wonder what verbose=2 is good for. Could this probably be explained in the documentation? (I guess it is a real superset for the output of verbose=1?)
Also: Why is the verbosity not passed here: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py#L1418?
(I was trying to figure out why the ProgbarLogger is not showing up, although I have verbose=2)
