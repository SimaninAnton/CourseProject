Compare to the exist "stateful" params.
I have a new idea to enhance the Keras model.
A time synchronized model ensures all layers in it share the same timestep.
Then, we can use it for some special task, like sequence generation or machine translation etc.
To implement a time synchronized model in Keras. The basic way is that we should write all layers in just one step function, because each layer in Keras model use "K.rnn / T.scan" separately.
But we have got so many wonderful layers implemented in Keras. They are powerful and friendly.
My idea is that we can write a model wrapper or a infrastructure to reconstruct all layers in current models into one step function. The new model works like existed recurrent layer.
Thanks, everyone.
I'm sticking in the trap of "stateful". It looks like a patch rather than ability for current project.
I need to write more temporary code to successfully run a stateful model.
