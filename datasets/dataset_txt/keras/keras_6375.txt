Dear Fchollet,
Thanks for the amazing tool you made for us. I was wondering if you would be interested in adding support for the open source visualisation library bokeh for keras. I have made a small library that allows one to create a graph with a single line and then update it with one more line when a new data point appears. Using the bokeh server you can have real time interactive charts. Would you be interested in adding this to your library ?
