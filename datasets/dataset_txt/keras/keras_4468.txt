I'm just wondering if anyone can see any obvious reason, why, when porting a CNN model from
TFLearn to Keras, I would get a ~8% reduction in accuracy (I'm assuming I'm making a mistake somewhere in the ported code). Any help would be much appreciated.
The same dataset is used for both implementations.
TFLearn code
https://github.com/chrisruk/cnn/blob/master/train_cnn.py#L28
Prints:
SNR 18 ACC 0.947874306839
Keras code
https://github.com/chrisruk/models/blob/master/cnn_generate.py#L267
Prints
SNR 18 Test accuracy: 0.860998151571
Cheers!
