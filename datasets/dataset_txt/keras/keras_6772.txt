Hi,
My question is as below:
I have an input vector, e.g., 100-d, and I need to feed the same vector into the LSTM multiple times, e.g., 5 times sequentially, and hopefully I can get 5 different outputs based on the input. How could I do this? Based on the input of LSTM layer, the input dimension is fixed, e.g. 100, how should I handle a 100*5 input based on sequential input?
Also, after one input, how should I manually clear the memory state inside the LSTM so that I can feed another (different) input vector to LSTM?
Many thanks for the help.
