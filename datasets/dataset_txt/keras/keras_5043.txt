I'm working on a dataset where we want to produce a prediction for every datapoint in a sequence. For example, sequences may be 128 steps long, and we want to predict one of 7 labels for each step. So the final output size is (nb_samples, 128, 7). Then I applied softmax loss (which it was not clear from documentation this would work, but the code seems to support it).
The documentation here says that the categorical_crossentropy loss is only for shapes (nb_samples, nb_classes). However it appears to be working for my data. If it is supposed to work, the docs need to be updated / improved. If not, it should have error-ed and I don't see any available option for this scenario.
