Hello guys : )
I'm wondering is it possible to build encoder decoder model in the paper "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" with Keras ?
In the model, encoder's output (hidden), is used to init the hidden(h_0) of decoder, instead of as input to decoder. Based on my current understanding, model in the examples/addition_rnn.py is not same with the one above.
It would be greatly appreciated if someone has suggestions & ideas,Cheers
