Which then cause the dim_ordering attribute to always be 'th' for all conv layers, if it's not set locally.
Possible solution
I am not sure if this is intended, but backend/init.py in current master branch seems to be missing
set_image_dim_ordering(_image_dim_ordering)
right below
    set_floatx(_floatx)
    set_epsilon(_epsilon)
by adding the missing line, the issue is resolved for me.
Although i am not sure if there will be any unwanted downstream effect.
