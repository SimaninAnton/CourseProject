On Python 3.6.6, Keras 2.2.4, and TensorFlow 1.11.0 I occasionally get the following ValueError when running a test script that is evaluating different variables in an LSTM network.
"ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer dense_1: expected axis -1 of input shape to have value x but got shape (y, z)"
X, y, and z are all integers; they've varied depending on the variables I'm testing. The ValueError crashes the testing script; If I restart, it proceeds from where it left off without problem. I haven't seen anything about this error when searching for it, so I thought I'd post here to see if there was a solution. Thank you for your help.
Relevant scripts:
