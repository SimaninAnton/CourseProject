I have experienced the latest version of Keras in github, and noticed that there is a big difference from previous versions.
TimeDistributed has now been separated as a wrapper.
TimeDistributedDense can be replaced by TimeDistributed(Dense())
how about the TimeDistributedMerge?
should we write an Lambda layer by ourselves?
