I am experiencing compilation issues using the Theano backend for this model:
https://github.com/mikekestemont/pandora/blob/master/pandora/model.py
The problem seems to lie with the recurrent LSTM encoder on lines 97-139. With bleeding edge installations of Keras and Theano, the model runs fine (and compiles quickly) on the CPU of my local machine, but fails to compile within a reasonable time on the server's GPU (Ubuntu). In fact, Theano seems to get stuck in the compilation phase. A couple of other users reported similar issues in the past days:
#1601 ("The scripts hangs while initializing the net, giving no error nor warning")
#1600 ("Stuck in compiling")
#1520 ("Theano doesn't crash, it hangs, with no error message that could be used to diagnose the problem. This happens during the compilation step.")
This is a vague question, but is there any chance that these errors are in some way related? Thread #1520 suggests a relation to T.dimshuffle? What about the Repeat layer?
