How do I use model_from_json if I have custom layer. Here it says that we just have to insert it to globals:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/utils/layer_utils.py#L23-L24
I did import the layer, but it didn't work for me. Am I missing something? Do they mean anything else with "insert to globals"?
