I have very huge file of words which I want to convert to vectors and put them to learn online. As I read other issues the most "correct" way to do so is to use model.fit_generator. But I am in doubt will fit_generator circle my huge file by itself? And second question what to put to samples_per_epoch to make fit_generator use all data from file?
