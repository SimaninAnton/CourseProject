Im using wideres architecture
since I want to load the tensors from last denselayer, I return it as follows,
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[ predictions_a])

 return model
ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 31 layers into a model with 30 layers.
How can I be able to sort this out?
