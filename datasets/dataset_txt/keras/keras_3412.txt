Hey everyone,
I created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters, still couldn't figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow, does better convergences and produces better(slightly but better) results.
Does Keras implement a different weight initializer method? or performs different weight decay approach other than tf.train.inverse_time_decay?
P.s. the score difference is always like
Keras with Tensorflow: ~0.9850 - 0.9885
Tensorflow Native ~0.9780 - 0.9830
Thank you in advance
