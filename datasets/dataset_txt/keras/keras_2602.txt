I have a binary classification network with a softmax layer at the end:
predictions = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(x)
When I do model.predict() I get results as below. How do I interpret this array? If 0.00673855 is the probability for class 0 and 0.0016871 is the probability for class 1. Shouldn't they add up to 1.0 ?
[[ 0.00673855 0.0016871 ]]
