Following two snippets of code are equivalent. One uses sequential model and the other uses functional API. While the first snippet works fine, the second one throws up following error:
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
Aren't both sequential and functional models supposed to work in the same manner?
Sequential Code
InputModel = Sequential()
InputModel.add(Embedding(10000, 300, input_length=30,trainable=False))
InputModel.add(Reshape((30,300,1), input_shape=(30,300)))
Code using Functional API
Question1 = Input(batch_shape=(None, 30), dtype='int32')
WordEmbedding1 = Embedding(10000, 300, input_length=30, trainable=False)(Question1)
x = Reshape((30,300,1),input_shape=(30,300))(WordEmbedding1)
