I have what I assume is an installation issue.
I'm using Tensorflow (latest), Keras (latest), and python 2.7.13.
My script:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
The problematic line is model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
Which yields the trace:
Using TensorFlow backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):

Any method that adds a layer to my model throws this error.
P.s. I'm not sure if I was supposed to leave this template text in my issue, if not, let me know and I'll delete it.
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
