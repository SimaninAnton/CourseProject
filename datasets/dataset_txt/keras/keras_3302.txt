Consider the process of loading a TF checkpoint in TF:
self.sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
self.sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.all_variables())
saver.restore(self.sess, tf_ckpt_path)
and then I am abel to do self.sess.run(stuff) etc.
The problem is, if I do the above in a Keras jupyter notebook, I am not really building a Keras model, but still using a TF model.
How can I change this model into a Keras model (without building the model from scratch again), such that I can follow the directions in https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js to run the model in Keras.js (which is ultimately what I'd hope to do)? Thanks.
