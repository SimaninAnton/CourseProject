Hi, everybody,
I want to train my model to learn time series. The input dimension is (batch_size, 100, 23), 100 and 23 denote time steps and features at a time, respectively. The output dimension is (batch_size, 100, 2) as there are two label values to be learnt. Here is my code:
batch_size = 25
epochs = 100

 model = Sequential()
 model.add(LSTM(50,
                   batch_input_shape=(batch_size, 100, 23),
                   return_sequences=True,
                   stateful=True))
 model.add(LSTM(50,
                   batch_input_shape=(batch_size, 100, 23),
                   return_sequences=True,
                   stateful=True))
 model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(2)))
 model.summary()

 model.compile(loss='mse',
                         optimizer='rmsprop')
 model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=epochs,
               verbose=0) #,validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid))
The summary of the model is
However, it stops here and there is no more outputs. What's wrong with my model?
Thank you in advance!
