The following error did not occurred before Theano and Keras update (last week) from master.
I've built a costume LSTM layer that worked fine... after the update the following error happened:
Weights are initiated like:
self.W_iof = self.init(self.Shape)
the rest are similar
3. Error happened in the next line (keras/.../training.py, 259) :
weights.sort(key=lambda x: x.name)
ERROR:
TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() < NoneType()
After adding names to weights it was fine.
Please change something, like adding default names or remove that sort (why?)
