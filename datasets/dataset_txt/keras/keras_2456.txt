I was using
from keras.preprocessing import image
img_path = "/root/.../tmpImage.png"
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
img = image.img_to_array(img)
to get the an array from that image and then save it. I quickly ran out of space, because img_to_array is retruning dtype of float32.
print(type(img))
print(img.shape, img.dtype)
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
(224, 224, 3) float32
For this part I will switch to scipy because they are using unit8. This is a minor bug but can be anoying to trace down.
Cheers!
