I want to create Stacked Convolutional Auto Encoders.
I don't know how to do a deconvolution.
For example, If I do convolution with 32(Filter Size)x7x7 filter on 1x28x28 input image, then the output will be 32x22x22. And I want to do a deconvolution it to 1x28x28 image.
How Can I do this one?!
Thank you in advance!
