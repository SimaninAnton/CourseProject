input = ...
left  = LSTM(output_dim=5, return_sequences=True, name='left')(input)
right = LSTM(output_dim=5, return sequences=True, name='right', go_backwards=True)(input)
mix   = merge([left,right], mode='concat')
mix is of shape (None,None,10)
Now I want to take average along the time dimension to get a layer of shape (None,10) which takes the mean of all the sequences in mix. How can this be done?
