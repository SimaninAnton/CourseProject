Hi,
When running python autogen.py it fails with:
/u01/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/init.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from float to np.floating is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type.
from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters
Using TensorFlow backend.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "autogen.py", line 273, in
(preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator, '*')
AttributeError: module 'keras.preprocessing' has no attribute 'image'
I cloned keras just a couple of minutes ago.
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
