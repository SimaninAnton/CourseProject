Hi everybody!
I am trying to build an architecture of a convolutional network for image denoising as in pic below using keras with tensorflow backend. It's written that "in layers 2, 3, and 4, each feature map is connected to 8 randomly chosen feature maps in the previous layer."
So I was wondering if there is a way to use only some random number of filters out of all for applying them to feature maps on each convolutional step? I suppose, Conv2D layer in keras by default passes all feature maps from previous layer to all nodes (filters).
Thanks in advance!
