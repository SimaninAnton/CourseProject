I am having issues with trying to get the sample variational autoencoder working. Running the script verbatim from the site but keep getting results that look like all locations from the latent space are producing the same output and the distribution of test images over the latent space is no where near as spread out. Running on the latest version of Theano and Keras.

Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
