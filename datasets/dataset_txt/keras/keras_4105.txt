Hi, I've been playing with the Keras library for a couple of weeks now and I have noticed that on my installation (TensorFlow using CPU) 1D Convolutions are about six times slower than 2D Convolutions with equivalent dimensions. I believe this is caused by the expanding and squeezing of the 1D Convolution output tensor. There is an example on https://github.com/oliverhiggs/keras-examples/blob/master/conv_speed_example.py
Thanks for your time.
