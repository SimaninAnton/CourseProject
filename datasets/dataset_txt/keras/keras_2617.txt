I want to access the activation values of the hidden layers of a model
the method that looks the simplest (other suggestions are welcome) is to define these hidden layers as additional outputs with loss_weight set to 0
this appears to work fine when creating a new model.
Is there a way to change an existing (trained) model to add outputs?
