My problem is thisï¼šI want to use a abnormal layer in the last second layer , and the last layer is softmax. This abnomal layer has two input matrix X and Y, and the output of it is exp(XPY), in this case, P is the weight matrix I need to update, I want to know if there are any possibility to use keras to do this?
