ReseNet 101, 152 and others? I wanted to use 152 layer ResNet model. But found only the 50 layer version in applications.

which I found after a lot of googling might help sb looking for it. So please consider maintaining a database of trained model weights.
Further more it would have been great to be able to use a trained hourglass model as described in here
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf
But I can not find a way to convert the model weights. In fact it is not very difficult to write the model architecture but the main problem is the pretrained weights. Do any one know how to convert torch t7 model weights to keras? If not would any one here be interested writing a library?
