I have a GRU to which I set the initial hidden state by doing something like this:
first_decoder_gru = shared_gru_decoder(merged_first_input_decoder, initial_state=[context_gru_first_slice])
If the GRU's number of units is 400 and I set the initial hidden state with a tensor of dimension 300, shouldn't there be a problem? As far as I know, the dimension of the hidden state should be the same as number of units. Currently I can train the model with no warnings or errors. I am using keras 2.0.1 and tensorflow 1.0.1
