I receive the following error when using fit_generator with callbacks in Keras:
/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Keras-2.2.4-py3.6.egg/keras/callbacks.py in _call_batch_hook(self, mode, hook, batch, logs)
     93                 'Method (%s) is slow compared '
     94                 'to the batch update (%f). Check your callbacks.', hook_name,
---> 95                 delta_t_median)
     96         if hook == 'begin':
     97             self._t_enter_batch = time.time()

TypeError: integer argument expected, got float
Apparently it happens with some combination of warnings package and Keras packages, or something else. Any idea for a quick workaround that does not involve removing callbacks?
