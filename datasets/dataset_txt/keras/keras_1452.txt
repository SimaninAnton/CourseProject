The examples directory in keras repo has Python scripts giving various accuracies on the IMDb dataset. But which of them gives the highest accuracy on the IMDb dataset?. It would be helpful if the accuracies are commented on the top of the scripts for specific hyperparameters like epochs, optimizer etc.
