I'm using LSTM to predict value at next time step.
I have January's time series data where values are recorded every 15mins.
Now I want to test this model real-time every 15mins in February.
Note: At any point during testing [February] I would not have a sequence as it is real time and the future values are not known yet.
train_X = [ [4], [5], [6.3], ...., [4.5] ]  #JANUARY's DATA
train_y = [ [5], [6.3] , .., [4.5], [5] ] 

test_X1 = [ [5.3] ] #FEBRUARY 1st @ 00:00 AM
predicted_y1 = model.predict(test_X1)

# Following data appears only after 15 mins in real-time

test_X2 = [ [5.6] ] #FEBRUARY 1st @ 00:15 AM
predicted_y2 = model.predict(test_X2)
Basically problem is
model.predict(test_X)
fails because test_X and train_X have different dimensions.
The goal is to make predicted_y1 as close to test_X2 as possible.
