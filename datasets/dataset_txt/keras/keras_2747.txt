i am running keras for a while now. saving models working fine using:
model.save('meta/model.h5')
as FAQ is suggesting ( https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model )
but loding a model like:
model = load_model('meta/model.h5')
fails with:
TypeError: load_model() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
How will the machine know where to get model with 0 arguments ^^.
I am running:
pip show keras
