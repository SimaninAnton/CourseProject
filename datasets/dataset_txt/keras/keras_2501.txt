Hi,
In Keras the metrics can no longer return a dictionary. Now they have to return a tensor. However, I understand that this tensor is of a single value.
How can we return as metric a confusion matrix? We need the confusion matrix to compute for instance the IoU for semantic segmentation.
In keras 1 I had made a metric that returned the confusion matrix as values into the dictionary (Very ugly). However in keras 2 I can't even do this.
Any ideas?
Thanks
