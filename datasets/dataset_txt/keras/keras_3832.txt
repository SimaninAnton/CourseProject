I want to propose a change to keras but would like advice on how best to do this change so that PR gets accepted. I would like to make model.trainable=True flow down so all the layers inside this model are non-trainable. I see a few ways to do this and not sure what the best way is:
1,. Make Model.trainable its own parameter not inherited from Container.trainable. When it is set to False (or True), set all layers trainable to False. This will have to run recursively if there are models inside the model.
Somehow work with Containers.trainable and when Model.trainable is set, containers somehow knons to update the trainable for all the associated layers in the model.
When returning trainable weights, look at model.trainable to override the layer.trainable property.
Something else.
Advice greatly appreciated.
Isaac
