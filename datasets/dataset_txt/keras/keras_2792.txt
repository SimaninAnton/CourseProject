A well trained image recognition CNN model (~97% acc) predict classes that do not correspond to original class_indices
Example:
datagen.class_indices=['class0':0,'class1':1,'class2':2,'class3':3,'class4':4]
When i predict one image (from class0 for example) the prediction looks like this:
[0,0,0,1,0]
Prediction index = 3 (very consistent results for all images for class0)
Should the prediction for images in class0 look like this?:
[1,0,0,0,0]
This is true for all images i classified: the prediction result does not correspond to original datagen.class_indices
