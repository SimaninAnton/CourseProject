Hello. I am new to Keras and Theano. I apologize if this is a very basic question. I want to load the initial network connection weights from a npy file. Here are the relevant lines of my code:
import numpy as np
from keras.utils.theano_utils import sharedX
weights = np.loadtxt(my_path).reshape((4,4))
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(4, 4, init=sharedX(weights)))
The error I get is: TypeError: 'TensorSharedVariable' object is not callable. I am confused because the initializer functions I saw in the Keras code seemed to return shardX of a numpy array. Could you please explain why I am getting this error and how to load weights from a file.
Thanks!
