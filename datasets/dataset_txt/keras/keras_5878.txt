I was going over the example in:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/stateful_lstm.py @fchollet
and I'm a bit confused. The RNN assumes size (nb x 1 x 1). When cos (of size N x 1 x 1) is given as input, model._fit will randomly sample different mini-batches from the input at each iteration. How is the temporal dependency kept? I'm also confused about the propagation of derivatives with stateful RNNs - how are the derivatives wrt the internal states propagated back in time?
