When define a keras model, Input layer is often used.
But I can't find any explanation about Input layer.
So looked into source file, and found an InputLayer class in keras/keras/engine/topology.py.
Looks InputLayer is the Input layer class, but the name is different.
For example, the use of Input layer is as below like any other layers.
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda, Layer
It is not "import InputLayer".
Is InputLayer the class of Input?
