Hi.
I have a question about 'validation_split' option in [model.fit]
My question is,
(1) Does 'validation split' option randomly choose validation samples?
(2) If it randomly choose it, does it shuffle them for each epoch ?
(3) If it doesn't shuffle, will 'shuffle' option might work for randomize validation split ?
Please answer me if any one has an idea.
Thank you.
