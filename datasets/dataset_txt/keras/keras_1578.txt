I train a model with the following code:
base_model = VGG19(...)
..............
model.fit_generator(...., callbacks=[ModelCheckpoint(filepath=checkpoint_file, save_best_only=True,
                    save_weights_only=True)]....)
however, when I load the weights with the following code:
from keras.utils.training_utils import multi_gpu_model
model = load_vgg19(...)
model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=3)
model.load_weights(checkpoint_file)
model.fit_generator(...........)
I got the error: ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 3 layers into a model with 1 layers and followed by AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'TF_DeleteStatus'. Is this a bug?
