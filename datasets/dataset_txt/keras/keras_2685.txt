The code of 'keras/examples/stateful_lstm.py' works well on my computer.However, after training the model, i tried making two predictions continuously , "predicted_output1 = model.predict(cos, batch_size=batch_size); predicted_output2 = model.predict(cos, batch_size=batch_size);". What makes me surprised is that the prediction results is not the same. They are almost the same, but still a relative error about 1e-6 still exists. Could you explain why ? Are there any random factors in a trained model ?
