hi, I just got a problem when I run a sequential model.
I fit the model firstly, and then I want to get the first FullConnect Layer's parameters ,that is "dense1 = model.get_layer(index=1).get_weights()". But I got the wrong "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_weights' "ã€‚I have no idea about this. Can anyone help me?
Sincerely
