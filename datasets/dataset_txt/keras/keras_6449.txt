I am confused for weeks how can I implement Dynamic Memory Networks (from the paper "Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing", a really excellent model) with Keras. Could anyone give me some hints or show me a simple implementation? Also, thank you guys for the awesome work to this software.
