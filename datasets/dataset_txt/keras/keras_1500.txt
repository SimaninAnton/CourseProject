I want to create a custom merge operation similar to Average().
class Average1(Merge):
"""Layer that averages a list of inputs.
It takes as input a list of tensors,
all of the same shape, and returns
a single tensor (also of the same shape).
"""
def _merge_function(self, inputs):
    print("here")
    output = inputs[0]
    for i in range(1, len(inputs)):
        output += inputs[i]
    return output / len(inputs)
Does not execute merge function as print("here") does not get printed
