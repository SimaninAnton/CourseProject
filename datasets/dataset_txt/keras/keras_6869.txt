From what I understand so far, masks "hide" a particular input or output data item so they don't get updated or contribute to learning. Which is obviously awesome.
However it seems to only work on -items-. Any chance to get it to work on points (as in if you have multidimensional time input for example but missing particular items from that dimension)? Would be a good way to deal with missing features and/or outputs.
