Let's say I wanted to train a 1D Convnet. I use 100K examples for training, where each training example is 1000 samples from a 2 channel audio file. I assume for this example that nb_samples=1000 and input_dim=2.
What would steps represent in this case? My input tensor to model.fit is size (n_examples, nb_samples, input_dim)
