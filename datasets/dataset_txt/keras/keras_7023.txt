How to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to do some labeling task, such as semantic role-labeling?
The labeling task assigns a label to each element in the input sequence, therefore the training target is also a sequence. This type of task can be resolved by RNN.
I am a newbie of keras. I only found a RNN example for classification. Is there a way to train a RNN with sequential target?
