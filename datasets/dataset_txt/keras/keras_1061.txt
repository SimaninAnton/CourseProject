I am training, just to check my code, Imagenet on the pretrained Imagenet inception V3. However the accuracy I obtain is zero. I suspect this might be due to the fact that the hot vector I input does not match the order in the categories in which the model was trained. I have seen that there are more than one set of category orders out there , see for instance: https://gist.github.com/aaronpolhamus/964a4411c0906315deb9f4a3723aac57
and

which one should I use to match the pretrained inception_v3?
