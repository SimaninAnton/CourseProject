I am training a graph model in which there is a class imbalance issue. I would like to address it using weighted_objectitve with categorial cross entropy loss. Can anyone give any example on how to use it. Weighted_obejctive is tested in tests/test_loss_making.py but it is not evaluated on some model. I can define: weighted_loss = weighted_objective(objectives.get('categorical_crossentropy')) and then pass it to graph.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss={'output':weighted_loss}), now my question is how can I pass the weights during graph.fit ??
Can anyone give some input regarding this??
