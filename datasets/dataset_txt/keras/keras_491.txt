In general, all keras.utils.*_utils.* functions and classes that are documented on keras.io are available directly in keras.utils and documented as such. However there are a few discrepancies:
keras.utils.vis_utils.model_to_dot is not available in keras.utils.
keras.utils.np_utils.to_categorical sometimes appears in the documentation, instead of keras.utils.to_categorical.
keras.utils.io_utils.HDF5Matrix sometimes appears in the documentation, instead of keras.utils.HDF5Matrix.
This introduces some confusion as to what is part of the official Keras API or not: in particular, are keras.utils.*_utils packages part of the Keras API or not? Possibly as a result of this confusion, tf.keras is not consistent with keras-team/keras, as it has no tf.keras.utils.*_utils packages, and is missing model_to_dot altogether. Arguably this is a tf.keras issue, but the fact that only three utility functions are placed in keras.utils.*_utils packages is surprising IMHO.
I will propose a PR to fix this by:
Adding model_to_dot to keras.utils
Fixing the documentation to remove all references to keras.utils.*_utils packages.
