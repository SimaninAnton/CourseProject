Hello,
I am getting crashes on GPU powered training while using Activation layer with sigmoid function:
    model = Sequential()

    model.add(Activation('sigmoid', trainable = RP['trainable_inner']))
Full traceback can be found here and happens seconds after calling fit function. Changing the activation function to tanh or relu fixes the problem, as well as switching to CPU.
Setup: Nvidia GeForce 1080 GTX GPU, Cuda 8.0RC, cuDNN 5.0.5, Theano backend, Intel Core i7-5820K CPU, Ubuntu 16.04
I would be thankful for any help or insights!
