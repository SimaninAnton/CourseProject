Is there anyway to add an LSTM layer with scalar input to a Sequential model? I'm trying to build a network that takes in scalar and discrete time input (0,1,2,...), but there doesn't seem to be anyway to make the LSTM layer accept a 1-dimensional input_shape:
Here's what I tried with the error listed:
model2.add(LSTM(1024,input_shape=1));
Error: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
model2.add(LSTM(1024,input_shape=(1,1)));
model2.add(LSTM(1024,input_shape=np.asarray(1).reshape((1,1))));
Both work, but then when I want to train the network, it expects a 3-dimensional input.
Thanks
