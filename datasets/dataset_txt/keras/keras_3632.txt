Hi, I read the document of image preprocessing (keras/docs/templates/preprocessing/image.md) .
In the example of transforming images and masks together.
what are the variables "images" and "masks" in the column?
image_datagen.fit(images, augment=True, seed=seed)
mask_datagen.fit(masks, augment=True, seed=seed)
And to reminder the python 2.X users, I think it would be better to add a comment, using "izip" instead of "zip" in the line.
train_generator = zip(image_generator, mask_generator)
