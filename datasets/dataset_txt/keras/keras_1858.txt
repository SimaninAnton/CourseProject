0down votefavorite | My input data's dimension is equal to (500000,3253),
When I try to execute this line in my code:
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=100, epochs=100,verbose=0)
It gives me this error:
ValueError: Error when checking input: expected conv1d_1_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (500000, 3253)
So please how to reshape my data in order to have 3 dimensions ?
