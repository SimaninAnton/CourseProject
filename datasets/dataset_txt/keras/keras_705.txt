https://keras.io/constraints/ is badly rendered. There is a lot of text missing. This can come from one of those two things:
The file https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/docs/autogen.py which is responsible for grabbing the docstrings and making a markdown file.
The file https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/constraints.py if something has a strange syntax.
Actually it is also possible to use git bisect (magical tool, incredibly useful) to pinpoint which commit broke this page in the documentation. This is a good opportunity to learn how to use it. Once we know which commit broke the page, it will be easy to find out how to fix it. To learn how to use git bisect, see https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/beginners-guide-git-bisect-process-elimination .
