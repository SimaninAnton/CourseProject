Hi,
I create a base and a top model and merge them with base_model.add(top_model) and after training saved weights with model.save_weights.
When after training for testing I create the same model with the same layers, load_weights fails on this model with "ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 14 layers into a model with 15 layers." - if I create again the base model and the top model and stack them with "add" and then load weights it works...
But shouldn't those two models be exactly the same in terms of layers?
Thanks!
