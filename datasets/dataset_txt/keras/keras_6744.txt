I used TimeDistributedDense to label sequeces in each time before:
model.add(Embedding(wordlen,worddim))
model.add(GRU(worddim,128,return_sequnces=True,activation="tanh"))
model.add(TimeDistributedDence(128,3,activation="tanh"))
model.add(Activation('time_distributed_softmax'))
It works well before. But it always predict the same label when I update my keras yestoday? Is there any change? I didn't find any solution about this in documentation and issues before.
Thank you
