Hi,
Is there a way to rotate a filter in a convolution layer? Assuming I have only one filter, is there a way to configure the layer so that I get as an output the convolution of the input with 4 versions of the filter each rotated 90 degrees with respect to the prev. one? So my output is the output corresponding to 4 filters but these 4 filters are the rotations of one filter (they share the same rotated weights)
This can be done if I use 4 filters and find a way to force such constraint on the filter (if possible).
Any help is appreciated
