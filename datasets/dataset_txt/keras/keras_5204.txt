I want to use the graph model to train my model and use the mnist dataset. Then i rewrite the example/mnist_cnn.py
Both pool2 layer and conv3 layer as the input in the flat1 layer. I set the merge_mode='concat'.
we can get the output 32x6x6 in conv3 layer and 32x3x3 in pool2 layer.
Then i set the value（32x9x9）in the dense1 layer.I think it's wrong and don't know how to set the values.
