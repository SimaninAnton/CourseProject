Keras version 2.1.1
Tensorflow version 1.4.0
Python version 3.6
If I try to run cifar10_resnet.py example, I get this error: TypeError: fit_generator() missing 1 required positional argument: 'steps_per_epoch'.
If I add this parameter and set it to what it was before it was removed as a part of #8574 , everything works fine.
What is causing this issue?
