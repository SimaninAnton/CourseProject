This is a piece of code from wrappers.py of keras-2.
print "Before :", K.int_shape(inputs)
inputs = K.reshape(inputs, (-1,) + input_shape[2:])
print "After :", K.int_shape(inputs)
I added the print statements to see the change in shape. And apparently, running it with Theano backend gives a different output shape compared to Tensorflow. The print outputs are given below
Theano
Before : (None, 2, 4, 4, 3)
After : (None, 4, 4, 3)
Tensorflow
Before : (None, 2, 4, 4, 3)
After : (-1, 4, 4, 3)
Could someone tell me what's going on here ?
