Hello
i find that the code of the example may has some little error.
in the line 104, "num_words = min(MAX_NB_WORDS, len(word_index))", i think it should change to
"num_words = min(MAX_NB_WORDS, len(word_index)+1)".
for that, if num_words= len(word_index), then "embedding_matrix = np.zeros((num_words, EMBEDDING_DIM))". the shape of embedding_matrix is (num_words, EMBEDDING_DIM).
but for "for word, i in word_index.items():" , i is range from 1 to len(word_index), the code
"embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector" may be wrong.
overall, sorry for my poor english, but i think you may understand me, if i was wrong, i also hope you can help me find the mistakes i has made. thanks very much~
