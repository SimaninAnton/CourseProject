The cifar10_cnn.py example as it is fails to converge. If rmsprop is changed to adam or replaced with an SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, decay=1e-6, nesterov=True) optimizer, the example works fine. Examples of the history for the 200 epochs in the example are shown below. Other than storing and dumping the results to file via cPickle to produce the plots, nothing else in cifar10_cnn.py was changed excepting the optimizers as stated.
Theano backend, GPU mode, Ubuntu 14.04, running on an AWS g2.2xlarge instance ("G2 Instances are backed by 1 x NVIDIA GRID GPU (Kepler GK104) and 8 x hardware hyperthreads from an Intel Xeon E5-2670").
(Also thanks for making Keras with such a great API.)
