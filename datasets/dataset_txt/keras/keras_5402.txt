Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
[ y] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[y ] If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
[y ] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Code :
x = [numpy.random.rand(10) for v in xrange(100)]
y = [v.sum() for v in x]
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(20, input_shape=(10,1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.add(Activation('linear'))
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='mse')
model.fit(x,y)
The code above will give the following error:
Exception: Error when checking model input: the list of Numpy arrays that you are passing to your model is not the size the model expected. Expected to see 1 arrays but instead got the following list of 100 arrays : [ ...
Why does this happen? I have outlined my input dimension and outlined length - both match in the x.
Thank you
