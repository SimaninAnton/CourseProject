Hi all,
I encountered a problem to reshape an intermediate 4D tensorflow tensor X of shape ( batch_size, nb_rows, nb_cols, nb_filters ) to a new tensor Y of shape ( batch_size, nb_rows * nb_cols, nb_filters ), where nb_filters is always a known integer.
Of course, when nb_rows and nb_cols are also known integers, I can reshape X without any problem. However, what if nb_rows = nb_cols = None? I tried Y = Reshape( (-1, nb_filters))(X) but keras returns an error, basically saying that dimension can not be None.
For me, this operation is deterministic in the way that it always squeeze the two middle axes into a single one while keeping the first axis and the last axis unchanged. Can anyone help me?
