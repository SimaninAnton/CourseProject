Hi, I'm training my implementation of EDSR on V100 but unfortunately I can't train the model when I set my FP to 16.
Code: https://github.com/Golbstein/EDSR-Keras
I tried to change the RELU to Tanh and also tweaked the activity\kernel regularization without success.
The model does converge when training with float32 but it is x2 time slower.
When I train with float16, the loss goes down for about 10 mini-batches and then it suddenly start go up until I get 'nan' and 'inf' values..
any advice will be greatly appreciated
