Hello! I faced with problem that if I use a self-made activation function, for example:
def my_tanh(x):
      return 1.7159*K.tanh(2*x/3)
When I try load a saved model with such function from the .json file I, obviously, got a error, that Keras doesn't know this function. How can I avoid this? Thank!
