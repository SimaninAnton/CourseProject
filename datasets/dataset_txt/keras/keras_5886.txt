I try to classify Dutch and Belgian tweets (e.g. 2 classes) using LSTM. Right now, I have the following code:
max_features = 5000
maxlen = 140

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max_features, 128, input_length = maxlen)) 
model.add(LSTM(128, activation = 'sigmoid', inner_activation =  'hard_sigmoid', return_sequences = False))
model.add(Dense(2, activation = 'softmax'))

optimizer = Adam(lr = 0.001, beta_1 = 0.9, beta_2 = 0.999, epsilon = 1e-8)
model.compile(loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', optimizer = optimizer)
However, when I compile the model, I get an assertion error stating: AssertionError: The number of inputs given to the inner function of scan does not match the number of inputs given to scan.
At first, I thought it had something to do with my data, but the model does not 'receive' the data until you fit it, right?
