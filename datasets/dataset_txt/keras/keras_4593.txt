Hi,
Most of the times, my training stops abruptly with just a "killed" msg at the end of logs.
Epoch 1/1 296960/296960 [==============================] - 641s - loss: 2.3065 - val_loss: 3.8720 Epoch 1/1 165376/296960 [===============>..............] - ETA: 365s - loss: 2.1371Killed
I have checked the RAM and GPU memory, they both seem OK. Also, there is no more description in the msg to show what is causing this problem.
Sometimes this problem happens after like two epochs and sometimes after much more than that.(Using same code and data)
Any ideas?
