I have 1024 77 convolutional feature maps and I want to reshape them to a 491024 tensor. While reshaping, I want to put features from the same image patch into a row, that means I want to keep the 0th dimension untouched while flatten the 1st and 2nd dimension. I don't see any parameters in Reshape layer to do this, do I need to implement my own Reshape layer? Thanks!
