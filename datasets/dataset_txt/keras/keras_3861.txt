My os is ubuntu 16.04. The cuda is installed following the instruction in the developer.nvidia.com. The theano and the keras are installed via pip install . And the vesion of theano is 0.8.2. My GPU is GTX970 with 4G memory. All modular are tested and run properly.
I am training a CNN+LSTM network implemented with keras using theano backend.
If the cuDNN is installed into the cuda, the system will reboot randomly when the program was run.However, If the cuDNN is removed, the program can run properly.
