My model uses repeat vector to implement sequence to sequence:
seq = Input(shape=(None,), dtype='int32')
gru = GRU(hidden_size, dropout_W=dropout, dropout_U=dropout, return_sequences=False)(seq)
rep_layer = RepeatVector(2)
rep = rep_layer(gru)
gru2 = GRU(hidden_size, dropout_W=dropout, dropout_U=dropout, return_sequences=False)(rep)
out = TimeDistributed(Dense(output_dim=input_size-1, activation='softmax')

[...]
rep_layer.n = 3
What I want to do is change the n value of the RepeatVector layer in order to create longer sequence. When I do that, the length of the generated sequence does not change as expected, it stays the same. Do I need to recompile the model first?
