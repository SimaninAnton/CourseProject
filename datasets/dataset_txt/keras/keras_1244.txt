Hello everyone, I have a tricky programming question. I want to implement an exponentially moving average of centroids on hidden layers inputs activations of an AutoEncoder to maximize ICC over several class in keras
(adding a loss penalizing this term).
It would require to know the final output of the classification for calculating the centroids. I could do it by adding the output of this layer as an extra output of neural network. But it would duplicate data. And it won t be nice to work with in the case if I haven t to apply this on any hidden layers.
Do you have any ideas how to do so ? Thank you
