There are 2 issues:
rnn = SimpleRNN(10)  # Layer not built yet. So state_spec is None
x = Input((7, 5))
h_tm1 = Input((10,))
y = rnn(x, initial_state=h_tm1)  # >> Error
Another issue is at : https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L236
if hasattr(initial_state, '_keras_history')
Doesn't take into account when initial_state is a list. (Such as in LSTM, which has multiple states).
