I combined the outputs of 2 different CNN_ networks , each has 2 different layers, into a third model .I combined them using Merge layer (mode='concat') , but I cant access all the layers.
here is en example of my code:
    modelA = Sequential(name = "A")
    modelA.add(Convolution2D(......))
    modelA.add(MaxPooling2D(....))
    modelAadd(Flatten())


   modeB = Sequential(name = "B")
   modelB.add(Convolution2D(.....))
   modelB.add(MaxPooling2D(----))
   modelB.add(Flatten())

   merged = Merge([modelA, modelB,], mode='concat')

    model = Sequential()
    model.add(merged)
    model.add(Dense(---))
    model.compile(----)
I need to freeze the layer of the first model. and do fine tunning and transfer learning etc. I also need to visualize the feature maps of theses layers.
The code is fine, it works well. the only problem is that I cant access the the layers of modelA and modelB
Any suggestions.
