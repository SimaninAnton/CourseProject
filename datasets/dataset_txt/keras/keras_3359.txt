Docs state the below, but unroll is a parameter used by both backends.
unroll: with TensorFlow the RNN is always unrolled, but with Theano you can use this boolean flag to unroll the RNN.
For theano backend we use scan but for tf we use while_loop, even through tf also supports scan. Also, does anyone know if using scan instead of while_loop has any performance or other benefits?
Cheers,
