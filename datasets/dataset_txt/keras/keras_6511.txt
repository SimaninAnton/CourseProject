I'm training a net for a classification task.
I used the mnist_cnn.py as reference.
Currently I am limited to work with images of size 160x160 since using larger resolution causes the GPU to run out of memory (I have about 30K samples).
I tried to change the configuration to load images from an iterator in chunks of 5K (as suggested here).
I am sure there is no bug in the iterator code.
I even ran some simple tests to see the affects of splitting the data and I saw longer convergence times when the data is split.
Is this normal behaviour? how can I overcome this problem?
