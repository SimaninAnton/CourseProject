When I use the theano backend， it has a function sort to sort the tensor like this：
import theano.tensor as T
c =T.matrix('c')
sort_end =T.sort(c,anxis=1)
Howerer, now I want to use tensorflow as the backend, I fail to find a function like this. How to solve this problem?
Any help would be grateful!
