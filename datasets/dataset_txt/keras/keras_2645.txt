I would like to build a shared LSTM layer. But my input does not have the same size.
For example, I would like to train an LSTM model using tweets. The tweets from the same user should share the same weight. But different users might have different number of tweets. What should I do to deal with this problem.
My ultimate goal is to predict users' features. For example, whether the user is an active user or not.
The example of shared layer used here does not fit my problem.

In the example, each input has exactly two parts, data_a and data_b. But in my case, input size varies. For instance, user 1 has 2 tweets, the input is [tweet_1, tweet_2]. But user 2 has 3 tweets, the input is [tweet_1, tweet_2, and tweet_3].
Can anybody help me with this problem? Thank you very much.
