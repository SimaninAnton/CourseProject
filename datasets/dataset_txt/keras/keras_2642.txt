Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
Hi team,
I have been experimenting with this implementation of a convnet:
https://github.com/johnb30/py_crepe
The dataset is available from this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?usp=sharing (ag_news_csv.tar.gz)
I have found that when using Keras 1.1.1 (or earlier), on both TF and TH backends, this model will start converging and learning (start at 25% and after 9 epochs is >90%).
Trying on the latest versions of Keras, I will not get any convergence. I iteratively tried different versions of Keras and found that the update from version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2 is the one that makes the difference. I made no other modifications to the code other than upgrading the Keras package.
Would anyone have any idea what is going on?
I'd like to be able to experiment with this network on the latest versions of Keras and TF if possible. I would also like to verify if there was a bug that was fixed post 1.1.1 (which then caused the net to break), or if there was a bug that was introduced post 1.1.1 (which then caused the net to break). :)
