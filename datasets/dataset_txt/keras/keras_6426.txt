I know this is quite a recurrent issue, but I think it's still an important one. I'm sure everyone is busy with adding all the new features/backends/etc but it has come to the point where a lot of keras's functionality is undocumented and changing from one commit to the other.
Digging through the (largely also uncommented) code and trying to infer what every new thing does and how every old thing changed is becoming cumbersome and utterly intractable. Half the merge mode are missing explanation even on the shape of the output. I do recommend not accepting any more pull requests that lack some form of explanation and maybe also updating the docs a bit from behind.
The API is awesome, but I'm starting to not know what the features are any more or what's the right way to access them >.>
