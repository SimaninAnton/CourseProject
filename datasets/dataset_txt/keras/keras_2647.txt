I would like to use a custom prediction method in a given Kears model.
For example, say I have a binary classifier and my prediction rule says that if the probability that an example belongs to class A is less than 0.8 then it should be labeled as class B (instead of 0.5 currently).
Is there any way to override predict method in Keras and not use predict_proba externally method and then applying the custom prediction rule?
