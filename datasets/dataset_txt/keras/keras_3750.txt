Hi, I'm using "keras.applications.inception_v3.py".
I have question in its implementation.
The conv2d_bn implementation is as
x = Convolution2D(nb_filter, nb_row, nb_col,
                      subsample=subsample,
                      activation='relu',
                      border_mode=border_mode,
                      name=conv_name)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=bn_axis, name=bn_name)(x)
I think BatchNormalization should be before ReLu, and other similar frameworks also have implemented BatchNormalization before ReLu.

I want to ask the reason to keep BN after relu
