I have a StepLearningRateScheduler for both automatic (with a monitored metric) and/or manual (with user specified list of epochs) scheduling.
I have added and example of training 28x4 wide resnet on cifar10 and achieved 5.8% error on CIFAR-10 testing set using keras. Is there any need in keras for this scheduler?
If not I will just close the PR and keep the code in my own separate repo.
Thanks
