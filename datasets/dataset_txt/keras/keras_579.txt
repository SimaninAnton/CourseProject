How to get BatchNormalization mode=2 which was in the previous versions of keras?
According to the documentation of keras==1.2.2 mode=2 does : ' feature-wise normalization, like mode 0, but using per-batch statistics to normalize the data during both testing and training.'
Why was mode removed? and is there any way to get that in the latest version of keras.
