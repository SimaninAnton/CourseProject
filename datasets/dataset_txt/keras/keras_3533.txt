I noticed that if the weights are specified explicitly in the Convolution2D constructor, the weights are still initialized using the initializer:
Initialization: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L118
Overwritten: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L134
Wouldn't the initialization be obsolete if the weights are specified?
