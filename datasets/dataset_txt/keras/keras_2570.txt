The full example is here: https://github.com/sachinruk/keras_simpsons. Basically Im trying to read in a picture of homer simpson, rescale it to size 224, 224 and create rotations, shifts etc. However, when I run the code segment below I get the error: ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rescale=1./255,
        rotation_range=5,
        zoom_range=0.2,
        horizontal_flip=True)

img_height = img_width = 224
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    './train/',
    color_mode = "rgb",
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=1,
    class_mode=None)

i = 0
img_list = []
for batch in train_generator: #.flow(x, batch_size=1)
    img_list.append(batch)
    i += 1
    if i > 5:
        break
The single simpsons image is in the train folder.
Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong here?
