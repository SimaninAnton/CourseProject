Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
I'm trying to implement a model with functional API where output of Dense Output_0 layer is feed back as input to separate/multiple sub-model like layers to predict labels from each of those different 3 Dense/Softmax layers.
Issue is, I don't know how to combine two variable shape inputs in a way it helps connected sub-model based parts to predict labels corresponding to output from Dense Output_0.
For Example:
Lets assume, Dense Output_0 is [0.9, 0.9, 0.1], so here Hidden 1 & Hidden 2 sub-model parts will be triggered and model predicts labels from Dense Output_1 & Dense Output_2. I can understand that Dense Output_3 will also predict labels but here I want to make those predictions to be really irrelevant for this particular one since it got input 0.1.
I'm sorry if this is something which is already discussed. In that case, I would really appreciate if anyone can point me to relevant documents/issues.
