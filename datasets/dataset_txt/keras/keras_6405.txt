I would like to announce that @fchollet suggested me to start organizing our wiki:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/wiki
Check out what I wrote and give us feedback before we announce it to the outer world.
I'd really like you guys to check the Built with Keras section and do some nice suggestions. You can write your suggestions to the wiki in this Issue.
