Hi:
Keras offer a easy way to add epoch to the model name when saving
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/callbacks.py#L400
filepath = self.filepath.format(epoch=epoch, **logs)
But with the code like below one, which is suppose to save model every 20 eopch:
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="{epoch:03d}"+".hdf5", period=20)
It save the model every 20 epochs like:
019.hdf5
039.hdf5
The model saving operation does happen after 20, 40 epoch were finished.
Is there a bug, or I missed something(?
thanks for your review
