I just spent a while trying to hunt down a bug that turned out to be caused by passing learning_rate instead of lr to RMSprop. I'm not familiar enough with the internals of Keras to tell whether there's good reason for allowing any user specified arguments to pass through. It would, however, be nice to get an error message on invalid parameter names.
