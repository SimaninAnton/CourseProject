If I run test_convolutional.py, I get two errors, one from test_convolution_1d and one from test_convolution_2d, both with similar outputs:

TypeError: CudaNdarrayType only supports dtype float32 for now. Tried using dtype float64 for variable None 
I can reproduce this on two different machines which have different graphics cards and different versions of the CUDA toolkit. Meanwhile I have .theanorc set up correctly, and have also tried upgrading to the bleeding-edge version of Theano (based on suggestions elsewhere). Neither has fixed the problem.
Are these tests passing for others?
Thanks!
