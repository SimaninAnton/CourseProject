I'm implementing Convolutional Highway Networks in Keras. The paper uses -1 or other negative values to initialise transform gate bias. In Keras's Highway Networks implementation, the transform gate bias is set to 1.
the add_weights function calls functions in the initialization module and no other ways around it.
Is it possible to initialise bias with customised function?
