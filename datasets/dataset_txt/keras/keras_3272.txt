I'm trying to implement an autoencoder that will receive an input vector (forward pass), and then feed it back to itself in the reverse direction. I basically want to reproduce the work from this paper`, as explained in the last paragraph of section 5. In the paper, they flip the weights matrix to simulate the backward pass (according to my understanding), so I'm wondering if keras offers a similar functionality?
Thanks
