I set the show_accuracy = True, but can't set class_mode which leads to the valid_accuracy didn't show when training a graph model. how can i solve this, i am just doing a very common three-way classification. thx~
In the source code, this part matters whether the class_mode can be automatically set.
deal with accuracy computation if len(self.output_order) == 1:
