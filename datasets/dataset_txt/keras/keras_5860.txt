My goal is to implement a many to one LSTM of 3 timestep. First step will take input as image features extracted from VGGNet fc7 (size = 4096), second will take one hot encoded vector of size 42 and third step will take another one hot encoded vector of size 42. See following figure
How do I model it in Keras ? It seem very simple as I just have to one one LSTM, but I do not understand how to give different input to LSTM based on timestep while training. How do I specify that ?

Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
