As title told, the memory keep growing when I train my model with fit_generator or do prediction with predict_generator with keras.utils.Sequence data generator, until the program crashed.
The workaround I found as below:
That is: splitting the dataset again and in between call gc.collect purposely to stabilize the memory usage.
So I believe this is a bug, somehow keras doesn't release the unnecessary memory in between batches.
