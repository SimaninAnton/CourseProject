Hi there, this might be due the version I have installed, but most of the examples seem to be missing parameters in various layers.
For instance, when I run the imdb_cnn.py example, the Dense layer is missing a parameter:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "D:/aviation/findingsConvolutional.py", line 66, in
model.add(Dense(hidden_dims))
TypeError: init() takes at least 3 arguments (2 given)
Is this because the examples are not up-to-date, or is my version (0.1.2) not up to date?
