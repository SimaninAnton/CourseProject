If there any way to check the intermediate values after each layer?
I write my a predictor program with my own convolution, maxpooling and so on, and import the weights trained from keras into my program. But the results predicted result is different from keras.
It must help a lot to debug my program if I can see intermediate values in keras.
Thanks
