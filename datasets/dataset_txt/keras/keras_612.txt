Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Tokeniser serialisation (or rather deserialisation in this case) was added to keras_preprocessing, but since it isn't linked in preprocessing/text.py, I cannot import it from keras.preprocessing.text, I have to import it from keras_preprocessing.text.
So here I'm suggesting we link this function from keras, so we don't have to use the utility report for imports. I'll submit a pull request shortly.
