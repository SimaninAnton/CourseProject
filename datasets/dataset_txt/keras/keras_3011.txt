Hi guys,
I am trying to change the learning rate at the third epoch in my keras model. I am trying to implement the solution posed by @EderSantana on Issue #888
 def scheduler(epoch):
    if epoch == 5:
    model.lr.set_value(.02)
return model.lr.get_value()

 change_lr = LearningRateScheduler(scheduler)

 model.fit(x_embed, y, nb_epoch=1, batch_size = batch_size, show_accuracy=True,
   callbacks=[chage_lr])
However, I get the following error:
       'Variable' object has no attribute 'get_value'
for the last line in scheduler function. Even " model.optimizer.lr.get_value()" does not seem to work for me.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
