Subsampling: Keras 1: What is the subsampling in the Convolution2D doing? Is it a "Stride" so the kernel is filtering only every 2nd pixel or so? Or is it a form of pooling? If so: What kind of pooling is it? MaxPooling? AveragePooling? Or does this subsampling, downsample the feature map created by the convolution?
