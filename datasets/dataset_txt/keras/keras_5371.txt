Hi,
I have two questions related to the input requirements for RNN layer.
1.) Is it possible to provide two separate inputs (not merged) to RNN layer so that both inputs have its individual weight matrix for calculation of output.
2.) If yes, is it possible to provide one input as embedded and other as normal 1-D feature without embedding?
If the answer is no to any of them, what will be best way to implement either of them? Will adding new layer for RNN suffice or even the training/optimization part needs to be modified.
Thanks
