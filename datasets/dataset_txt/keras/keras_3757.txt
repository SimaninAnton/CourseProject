Hi,
I'm using a CNN without shape parameters which can accept any size of input image.
However, I can't see how to pass input data of different sizes. I can't use a normal Numpy array, since this would constrain all images to be the same size.
I've also tried using a list, which doesn't seem to work.
Should I use a Numpy array with dtype object? Is there a particular convention for passing images of different sizes?
Cheers,
Fintan
