I just installed Keras with Tensor flow on a new computer with a Titan XP card, and the GPU processing is about 3 times slower than CPU. The GPU utilization is about 20%, the memory is utilized almost entirely (all 12 GB). My model is based on LSTM.
Any thoughts on potential reasons for that would be appreciated.
Thanks.
