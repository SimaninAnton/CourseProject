Hi, I just started using keras. Awesome work!
I tried to use LSTM with the following code
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(4096, 512, return_sequences=True))                                                                                                                
model.add(TimeDistributedDense(512, 4096))
model.add(Activation('time_distributed_softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop')
And I compared the efficiency with char-rnn, and found that the implementation in keras is about 4 times slower than Karpathy's (with the same batchsize).
Am I doing something wrong?
I've attached the theano profile result
Thanks you!
