I was looking at the source code of the whitening procedure. I found that the data is never mean centered before doing the whitening. Specifically, if we keep all the other options as False and just keep the image whitening to be true, then covariance matrix is computed without mean centering the data! Thus XX^T will no longer be the covariance matrix of the data if mean(X) ~= 0.
If everyone agrees with me on this, I can submit a pull request to correct this issue.
