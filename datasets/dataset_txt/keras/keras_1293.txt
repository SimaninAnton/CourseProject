Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
-Rest omitted because Not Applicable
Issue:
When using Model.fit(verbose=0), Keras still prints:
4/4 [==============================] - 0s 10ms/step
at the end of the fit() function.
Expected:
From the docs:
verbose: 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.
IMHO, verbose=0 should mean print _nothing_at_all. I like to do my own stats, and I have all these bars lines cluttering the logs.
