Really hope you can take this seriously. I read your previous responses very carefully. I also understand your explanations and suggestions. However, after I did some experiments today (since I have to use keras recently for an important paper) I think I should report this issue again.
I tried both the latest 0.3.3 keras (since keras-1 is not yet completed) and the pre-PR (#1811) version. Running the same imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py example,
it turns out that the performance does decrease quite a lot on my GTX 970M GPU with CUDA 7.5 and Theano 0.8.1.
0.3.3 --> 299s per epoch
pre-PR --> 116s per epoch
Many many thanks! #1811 #2088
