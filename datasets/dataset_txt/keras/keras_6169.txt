I need to do a realtime augmentation for my dataset. ImageDataGenerator has all the methods implemented for it but they are limited for now. I want to implement some of my own augmenting techniques (In my clone). I can see this file where these are implemented:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py
Right now i can look that changing the __init__ parameters in the ImageDataGenerator, writing own functions, and calling in flow() might seem to work. Is there any other change that i need to do for this? Or will it actually work this way?
Thanks.
