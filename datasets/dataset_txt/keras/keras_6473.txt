OK a Github issue is anâ€¦ unorthodox way to coordinate this. But I think it'll do the trick. @fchollet apologies if you'd rather we do this another way.
Over in the discussion at #395 it turned out that a bunch of Keras users and contributors will be at NIPS in Montreal this year. We should organize some sort of face-to-face meeting, maybe a dinner? I'll set up an availability poll and we'll try to pick a time and location that works for everybody. Watch this issue for updates.
