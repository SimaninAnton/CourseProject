Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or join the Keras Slack channel and ask there instead of filing a GitHub issue.
Thank you!
[x ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
[x ] If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
[ x] Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
When I use the autoencoder example from the keras blog
https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html
I would like to generate encoded data samples (encoded images).
This works well in the simple first example but the example lacks of at least one line on how to build an encoder.
Here is the gist:
https://gist.github.com/mojovski/8509ccad123184020cd32999f94705b4
And here is the issue in a nut shell:
input_img = Input(shape=(1, 28, 28))

x = Convolution2D(16, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same')(input_img)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), border_mode='same')(x)
x = Convolution2D(8, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same')(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), border_mode='same')(x)
x = Convolution2D(8, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same')(x)
encoded = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), border_mode='same')(x)

"""
# at this point the representation is (8, 4, 4) i.e. 128-dimensional
"""
encoded_input = Input(shape=(8,4,4)) #<--------- ? How to get this shape from the encoded layer?

x = Convolution2D(8, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same')(encoded)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Convolution2D(8, 3, 3, activation='relu', border_mode='same')(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Convolution2D(16, 3, 3, activation='relu')(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
decoded = Convolution2D(1, 3, 3, activation='sigmoid', border_mode='same')(x)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
encoder=Model(input_img, encoded)
#decoder=Model(encoded_input, decoded) <---------------- THIS FAILS
"""
error if enabled:
Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor input_1 at layer "input_1". The following previous layers were accessed without issue: []

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adadelta', loss='binary_crossentropy')


Thank you very much!
