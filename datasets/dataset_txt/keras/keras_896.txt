I am attempting to use dropout after an embedding layer. The usewarning says that the embedding layer no longer supports dropout but adding SpatialDropout1D afterwards will have the same behavior. However when I attempt to call SpatialDropout1D I get the error
ValueError: Layer spatial_dropout_1d_1 was called with an input that isn't a symbolic tensor. Received type: <class 'keras.layers.embeddings.Embedding'>
My code is
input_emb = Embedding(seq_len,dim_emb,trainable=False,weights=pre_train) 
input_emb = SpatialDropout1D(dropout)(input_emb)
I am using keras version 2.2 and tensorflow version 1.9.0. Is the usewarning outdated?
