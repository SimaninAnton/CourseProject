I define two subnets that output the tensor of the same dimension use functional model. I want get difference between them. for example：tensor1 [1,2,3,4,5], tensor2 [1,1,1,1,1], output=tensor1 -tensor2 =[0,1,2,3,4]
I don't know how to coding it in keras，I found “keras.layers.merge.Add()”，but i want difference，so i try “Add([tensor1 ,-tensor2])”, it is wrong
Can you tell me how to get difference between two tensor，or square of one tensor？
Thank you very much.
