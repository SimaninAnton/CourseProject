Is there a way in the functional API to create a group together of layer specifications, so a single command always adds that group of layers without weight sharing?
For example, say I create a residual module as
x = Input(shape=(3, 256, 256))
y = Convolution2D(3, 3, 3, border_mode='same')
z = merge([x, y], mode='sum'
Now I want to stack these residual modules on top of each other, so the output of one is the input to the next. I considered putting these three lines into a model with x as an input and z as the output, so I could apply that model repeatedly. But I believe this causes the Convolution to be the same in each stage of my classifier.
Is there a way to bundle together the specification of layers without tying together the weights in each place I apply that bundle?
