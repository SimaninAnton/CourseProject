I am writing a thesis where the main task it to rewrite a MatLab script using NARX into a Python script.
I would like to use Keras and Tensorflow to implement it but wasn't able to find anything about NARX in the documentation and even google doesn't cope with it.
Is here anybody who is very familiar with Keras and Tensorflow and can say whether I can use the library to implement a script using NARX.
Here is a link how NARX works in MatLab(https://uk.mathworks.com/help/nnet/ug/design-time-series-narx-feedback-neural-networks.html)
Here is a link to a python library which works with NARX
