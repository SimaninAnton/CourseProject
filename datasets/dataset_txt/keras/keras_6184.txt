Hey there,
I have recently been using the dl4j framework to develop a video classification program. Everything has worked, but I have been advised to use Keras for readability purposes. I also develop pyvec on the side, but I am currently having real issues in loading in videos and training on a frame-by-frame - video-by-video basis.
How best would I tackle this in Keras?
Thanks,
K
