I am trying to build a recurrent model with Keras that has an additional state (essentially a buffer) from which data is read conditioned on the input. My issue is that I am not sure what the best way to initialize this buffer is. I can think of some hack to make the layer read as input a concatenation of the actual input and the buffer, and process them separately in build and step methods, but this is ugly. Ideally I would like the layer to read two different inputs, and initialize the hidden state with one of them. Any suggestions on how to do this?
Thanks!
