Hello, I have read up on how to create custom activation functions here. Such as modifying advanced applications to something like:
'class customAct(Layer):
   def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self.supports_masking = True
    super(customAct, self).__init__(**kwargs)

def call(self, x, mask=None):
    return someFunction(x)

def get_config(self):
    base_config = super(customAct, self).get_config()
    return dict(list(base_config.items()) + list(config.items()))`
All the activation functions accept a parameter (a single value or an array of values). I want to pass my activation function a value to be used in its calculation each time it is used. I'm not sure where to start. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
