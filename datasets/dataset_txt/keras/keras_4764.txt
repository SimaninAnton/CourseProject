@fchollet pointed out that we should start looking for multi-GPU support in keras for theano backend, since TF backend already has that support. I am thinking to work on it. I am creating this thread to discuss ideas related to it.
Currently there are two options available for multi-GPU :
Platoon for data parallelism : https://github.com/mila-udem/platoon
Model parallelism : http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_multi_gpu.html
Which one should I try testing first? @fchollet ?
