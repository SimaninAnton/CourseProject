I am trying to understand the code given here:
.
I have implemented the whole code in a jupyter python notebook linked here:
When I start training the network, my notebook becomes unresponsive, my firefox browser freezes and crashes after sometime. The kernel dies too.
What can be the reason for this?
Are these 2 arrays noisy_movies and shifted_movies too large for the notebook to process?
Is anybody else experiencing the same issue as well?
I would be glad if someone can help.
