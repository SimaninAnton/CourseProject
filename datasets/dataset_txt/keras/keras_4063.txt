Hi,
I have a big dataset to process (millions of small images). Usually I do data augmentation (rotation + flip) before the training, but this time my cluster does not have memory enough to support it.
So I must do it on the fly! So while the NN is training.
How can I automatically modify the images at each epoch?
Ideally, I would like to modify the batch of images N+1 while the NN is still training on the batch N, like that I don't waste any time.
Thank for your help!
