I accidentally did the following for a 2D layer at the start of a neural net:
s = np.shape(X)
model.add(Conv2D(10,kernel_size = (5,5),activation = 'relu',input_shape = s))
Where s= (60000, 28, 28, 1)
I know it should've been s=(28,28,1), but the error message seems to contradict that:
ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer conv2d_4: expected ndim=4, found ndim=5
It should say found 4 dimensions and expected 3, and that makes noticing the error super hard.
This occurs in the current version of keras in PyPi as of 10 minutes ago.
