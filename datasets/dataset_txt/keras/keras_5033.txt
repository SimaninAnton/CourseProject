In keras, we can get the embedding vector given an input using an embedding layer. Is it possible to get the closest input which corresponds to an embedding vector?
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
