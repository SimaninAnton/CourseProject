ImageDataGenerator - feature-request support for 'BGR'
Some (or even a lot of) pre-trained models use BGR and not RGB.
The ImageDataGenerator does not allow using the method flow_from_directory() with that mode.
I think that it can be added as one more color_mode 'bgr', as it's very popular.
Workaround exists, by not using flow_from_directory and loading the data yourself, but this misses the elegance and utilization of the directory generator
