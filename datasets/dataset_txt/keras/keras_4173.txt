Say for MNIST I have 60,000 training points, with a batch size of 100. I would have 600 iterations. I would like to access the weights at every iteration.
I know I can access the weights with this (for a particular layer). But it is only accessible after it finishes all 600 iterations.
model.layers[2].get_weights()[0] gives a numpy array of the weights.
Any idea?
