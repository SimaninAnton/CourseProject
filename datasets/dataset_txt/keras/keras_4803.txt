Can I use the time distributed layer as an output?
Am I right in thinking if I have a time distributed layer after a LSTM and I give a sequence of targets to learn, it'll transmit the error through every temporal slice, therefore being equivalent to myself splitting the data in every combination going forward;
i.e. {[t,t+1],[t,t+1,t+2].....[t,...,t+n]}
I'm asking as I could split my data in that way, ensuring it learns all these patterns, but then I'll need it to do a lot more computation for something which should be equivalent if I'm right.
