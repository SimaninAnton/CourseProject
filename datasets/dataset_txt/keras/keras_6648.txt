On the home page of the documentation, there is a claim that "...Building ... a Neural Turing Machine ... is just as fast". This doesn't sound implausible, but I didn't think anyone had successfully reproduced the results from the NTM paper; does anyone know if this is referring to a specific NTM implementation, and if so, how well that implementation worked?
