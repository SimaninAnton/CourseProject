I am using python2 and i'm trying to get the activations of hidden layer. I am using the following code which is giving me an error.My Keras version is 1.0.3. and i have a 1 input 1 hidden and 1 output layer in my model. When I wrote this code I was using python3. Now I have loaded it in pycharm using py2, could this be an issue?
The code I am using is:
get_activations = theano.function([my_model.layers[0].input], my_model.layers[0].get_output(train=False), allow_input_downcast=True)
When I run the code it says:
AttributeError: 'Dense' object has no attribute 'get_output'
I have tried to use my_model.layers[0].output() which also does not work correctly.
What should I do to get the activations?
