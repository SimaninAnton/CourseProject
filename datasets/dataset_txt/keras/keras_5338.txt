This is a repost from Keras-users.
Hello,
I'd like to implement Holographic Embeddings of Knowledge Graphs in Keras, but I'm stumped as to how to go about it.
The key math is in Eq. 8: the k-th entry of the circular correlation is an inner-product between a and b circularly shifted forward by k indices.
I was thinking that the most direct way to do this would be to add a new merge mode, nothing in the backend documentation jumped out at me as being relevant to getting this done.
The only relevant function I found that should help is theano.tensor.roll
Any ideas of how to implement this in an efficient, elegant way with the tools available in the Keras backend? Hopefully something that would also work with TensorFlow so I could submit a pull request.
Thanks.
