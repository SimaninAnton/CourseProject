Hi,
I need to zero pad some images but I need to add the zeros only to the bottom and right.
Would you be interested in either:
changing ZeroPadding2D to include how many to pad in each location
including either pad_left/right/top/bottom
a more generic rotation function (something like A[newX0]+A[:newX0])
Thanks
