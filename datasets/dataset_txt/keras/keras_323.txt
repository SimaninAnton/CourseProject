Hello, Keras team!
I've been using VGG16 for transfer learning, but I'm using grayscale images.
model = VGG16(weights = "imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape = (img_width, img_height, 3))
As far as I know, VGG16 only accepts 3 channels for input shape. If I define my base model as accepting 3 channel images like above and don't define the colormode in ImageDataGenerater.flow_from_directory()- which defaults to RGB- the code runs and I appear to get good results.
But my input images are grayscale. Could someone explain what Keras is doing in the background in this situation?
