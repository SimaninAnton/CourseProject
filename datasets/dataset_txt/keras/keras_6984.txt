Hi,
I would like to use the "keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer" method in order to generate word sequencing for my corpus.
Is it possible to use the above mentioned method directly on a CSV file to generate a "keras.datasets.imdb"-like dataset ?
If possible, could you give me some indications to implement the solution ?
Any kind of help is appreciated :)
