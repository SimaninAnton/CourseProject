Hi everybody,
I have a windows laptop with the following configuration:
windows 7
Quadro M3000M video card
cuda 9.0 and its respective cuDNN library
conda 5 with Tensorflow-gpu 1.8.0 and Keras 2.1.6
I have a simple MLP to train using Hyperopt package to find the best hyperparameters configuration.
To get reproducible results, I fixed the seed with the command:
set_random_seed(1969)
Unfortunately, I get the different accuracy results and hyperparameters values at each run.
Any suggestions?
Many thanks,
Ivan
