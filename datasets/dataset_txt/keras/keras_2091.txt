@fchollet can you enable autocancelation on Travis? Haven't tested it out myself but it should cancel redundant builds (for example, if you push twice to a pr). I don't think it is enabled now but I could be wrong.

Travis seems to be doing a lot of work recently, especially with the new backend. Could help to cut back a little bit.
Cheers
