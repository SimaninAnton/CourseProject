I tried the example in the file "neural_style_transfer.py". I want to see the outputs features of relu units for a single image in VGG network. I do not want to trouble to modify the code so I simply duplicated the same image for three times and inputs them together to the net (using K.function to extract three outputs). But the output has negative numbers.
However, when I tried to extract the output of only one image (still kept three image as inputs, but using three K.fucntion() to extract their outputs seperately) the problem is gone.
Even for the positive values, joint outputs are still different from individual outputs.
This is weird, I worry if it may cause serious problem. See below for the code segments (I do not modify other codes)
