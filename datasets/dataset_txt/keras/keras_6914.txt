Most of the time when I have a bug it's because I haven't correctly figured out the input dimensionality for some hidden layer that's layered on top of a convolutional or max pooling layer. Can we have the code auto-compute the input dimensionality of non-input layers for ease of use? This would have saved me hours initially, as is how Passage works (you just specify the output dimensionality).
