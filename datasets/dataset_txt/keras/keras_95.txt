Hi all,
I am facing problem in Keras in the input feeding stage. Actually, i cannot envision how to feed my input with different mindset. I have a time series problem and i want to make prediction for the next 24 hour with one step-ahead prediction. My input is 168xfeatures, output is 1 scalar. I will use 168 steps look-back, namely, prediction(in training stage) at timestep t will depend on from t-1 thorugh t-168. Prediction at timestep t+1 will depend on from t thorugh t-167, and the problem arises here. And t+2,t+3,t+4 and t+23 will be performed. However, i must insert my predictions to the input at each stage for next 24 hour. It means if i predict value in timestep t+2 in training stage ,i will use values from t+1 thorugh t-166, and the values t-166 and t-165 for relevant feature (load feature) will be forecast values at time t(yhat_t) and t+1(yhat_t+1). How can i construct this type of input for keras?
