Hi,
I'm trying to use a LSTM where I provide word2vec vectors as inputs and I want to classify the this sequence into a set of categories, so, as training data, I have something like that for example:
"<text>", <category id>
"lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...", 5
So, my question is: how can I feed that into my LSTM?
Here is how I build my model:
# Create the LSTM Neural Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(
  Embedding(
    output_dim=word_vector_model.dimension,
    input_dim=number_of_words_in_dataset, # thats correct?
    mask_zero=True,
    weights=[embedding_weights], # what this should be?
    input_length=input_length, # what this should be?
    output_dim=number_of_categories # thats correct?
  )
)
model.add(LSTM(word_vector_model.dimension))
model.add(Dropout(0.5)) # try 0.3
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
What output_dim should be? The number of categories in y?
What are the embedding_weights?
What input_dim should be?
Thank you, and sorry if I don't understand the meaning of each field.
