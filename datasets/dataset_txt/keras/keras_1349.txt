I'd like to do a PR to speed up the tests on travis.
I already looked at the logs to see what tests are the longest to run, so far, it's installing the dependencies and running tests like ConvLSTM2D, rnns, separable conv, inception resnet...
I looked at the code and it looks pretty efficient to me, I've no idea how I could cut the running time by half (the target set in the request for contributions).
If someone would be kind enough to tell me what to look for or how to start, I would be happy to work on it and make a PR.
Thank you in advance.
