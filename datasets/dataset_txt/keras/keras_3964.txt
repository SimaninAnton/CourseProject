Hi Guys,
I was trying to implement a simple idea related the attention model.
What I'm trying to do is as follows:
1-given a clip of video which contains 16 frame which can be described by one vector using C3D model as a context.
2- every frame can be described by VGG model.
my question is:
how can I do to calculate the contribution of every frame to to get the context. literally the value of z in the attached image here using keras?. The target will be the class of the clip.
here in Image of what I'm trying to implement
