I have created a simple neural net (using keras) for my NLP application which classify data point into 1 of the 2 classes {Class labels: 0,1}. My model gave > 95% accuracy on Test data. I have deployed the model in production. Its running good. The prediction output of the model is sent as an email to users.
These end users can send back a feedback - if the prediction was right or not. I want to incorporate this feedback into the model so as to continuously learn from this feedback (both positive and negative feedback) and improve
How can I achieve the above ? I have read about Reinforcement Learning, Online Learning, Active Learning and Adaptive learning. Any pointers/tutorials (possibly with code) will be of great help.
