Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
I'd like this feature, specifically for implementing graph networks where the batch size dimension is overloaded with the variable number of nodes and edges per graph.
I wasn't sure how to best go about implementing it though. I'm happy to add in the check to
the relevant line, but most of the calls to model._standardize_user_data don't pass along additional kwargs.
Maybe the best option would be, in addition to adding the check, to subclass Model and switch that default flag to False. Seems hacky though. The other option would be to add an attribute to keras.Model instead of using the existing (unused) kwarg.
