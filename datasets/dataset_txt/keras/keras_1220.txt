https://keras.io/models/model/ states several times that batch_size if not supplied, defaults to 32. This is bad. I'll even argue it is formally wrong. If someone passes in an X of more than 32, it is reasonable for the developer to expect that the model is using all data data supplied to it, rather than only the first 32 entries. The fitting would not occur over all the data being supplied, which the developer would believe is happening, because, they supplied it. To silently ignore data being supplied I have to argue is an error. It doesn't even warn when supplied size is greater than 32, and batch_size is not supplied that it will throw training data away. This kind of silent discarding of data will lead to incompletely trained models.
batch_size should always default the length of the inputs supplied, unless otherwise supplied.
