In keras, it implemented the regularization technique. For example, if I'd like to implement loss function as Loss_function + a||W||_2, I just add a code <model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=64, W_regularizer=l2(0.01))> to make it.
But now, I'd like to implement Loss_function + a||W-W_0||_2ï¼Œ hopping the learned parameter W not far away from fixed parameter W_0. I do not know how to implement it with keras.
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
