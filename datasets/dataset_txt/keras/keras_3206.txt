Thank you!
Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
My problem with the current ModelCheckpoint callback is that when I pass in the validation accuracy as a parameter in the filename I get flooded with model checkpoints. To combat this I would propose a flag in the ModelCheckpoint called keep_only_last_file that checks if the old save should be deleted. In combination with the save_best_only flag only the best model is kept.
I would propose following API: keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=0, save_best_only=False, save_weights_only=False, keep_only_last_file=False, mode='auto', period=1). I am targeting everyone who wants to use the formatting options in the ModelCheckpoint without saving multiple models.
I can implement this myself.
