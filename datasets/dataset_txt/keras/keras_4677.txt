Hi all,
This is kind of an information request issue.
Is the following architecture possible with the Sequential model: LSTM with its output layer connected to several MLPs?
I tried to achieve this as follows:
Sequential( LSTM, Merge([Sequential(MLP), ... Sequential(MLP)], mode='concat') )
but run into a problem that Merge layer expects Tensors, not Sequential models.
How do I get such architecture to work?
