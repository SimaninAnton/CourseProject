truncated_gradient was removed from keras. it is supported in Theano.
when you have very long sequences and you want a long memory, truncating the gradient in BPTT can be essential to performance.
@fchollet expressed in several places that this can be done using the stateful rnn. however after working on it for the last week, i find this quite non-trivial. splitting the data to short sequences introduces many edge cases, and with sequences of varying length you have to implement the fit and evaluate loops yourself to control the state reset (see also #4185 )
