At the beginning I install Theano through pip so i cannot use Activation('relu') it will throw exception, Today I have update my Theano on github, Activation('relu') does not throw exception, but there is a problem, MaxPooling2D is not work,At the beginning my program takes 50s on each epoch and accuracy will be 0.99,but now it takes long time to calculate and accuracy is too low EAT is 900s accuracy is 0.2 most. then I use model.add(Convolution2D(8, 3, 3, border_mode='valid', subsample=(2, 2), activation='relu')) it takes little time, but accuracy is also too low, ETA is 40s accuracy is 0.5 most
how can i solve this problem?
