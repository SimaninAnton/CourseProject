flow_from_dataframe is a very useful function allowing flexibility that flow_from_directory lacks, for e.g, regression tasks.
But the problem with this function is it processes the dataframe's (filename) column in sorted way.
for example
filename y
a 3.2
d 2.2
c 5.2
in principle, the generator should process files in this way:
a,d,c
but the current implementation processes file in alphabtic order
a,c,d
this is not so convenient for predict_generator function
