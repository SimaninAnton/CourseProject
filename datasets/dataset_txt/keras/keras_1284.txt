Hey team keras,
after updating to version 2.1.3 I get an exception after calling train_on_batch with a flat int array.
The following commit should be the cause: 8ed57c1#diff-299cfd5886683a4b012f286403769fc1
I have added a comment to the new line 76 that when data is a flat list of integers x.ndim will throw an exception.
I dont undestand the commit, so can't really help with a fix, sorry.
Anyway, thanks for an awesome tool :-)
