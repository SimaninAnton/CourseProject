I've my own dataset with 2 classes and a lot of pixels don't belong to either of the classes.
I have assigned 0 to such pixels in the label image and 1,2 to the classes. I would like to train only for labels 1,2 and not 0.
I was wondering if there is a way, like in Caffe, to express the concept of "ignore_label" in Keras? Or there is an appropriate way to handle unlabeled pixels during the training phase?
Could be a good solution to use one-hot class vectors with the dimension 2, (corresponding to my two classes) and for the "don't-care pixels", set all the elements in the vector to 0?
Thank you!
