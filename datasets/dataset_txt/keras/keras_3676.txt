Hi
I am learning Keras, and I know K.tile is the backend of theano.tensor.tile, which can be traced back to numpy.tile.
But they behave differently, could anyone help me to understand them?
import numpy as np
from keras import backend as K
import theano.tensor as T
w = np.array([0.1,0.3,0.5,0.2,0.6])

print np.tile(w,(3,1))
print T.tile(w,(3,1))
print type(K.tile(w,[3,1]))
print type(K.tile(w,[3,1]).eval())
The outputs are:
[[ 0.1  0.3  0.5  0.2  0.6]
 [ 0.1  0.3  0.5  0.2  0.6]
 [ 0.1  0.3  0.5  0.2  0.6]]
Reshape{2}.0
<class 'theano.tensor.var.TensorVariable'>
<type 'numpy.ndarray'>
So how come the Reshape{2}.0 is a TensorVariableï¼ŸAnd why not pass in the actual value like numpy does?
Thanks!
