I have a sequence of distributions. I want to use a Recurrent layer to process each distribution then feed a sequence of those processed distributions into another recurrent layer. When processing in the first layer, the nb_timesteps is the maxlen of the distribution data (pad_sequences). In the second layer the nb_timesteps is the number of distributions in the past.
How can I accomplish this? I want to use two recurrent layers to turn a 4D input into a 2D output.
What layer can I use to accomplish this? Is this possible with Keras or do I need to fork it?
Thanks.
