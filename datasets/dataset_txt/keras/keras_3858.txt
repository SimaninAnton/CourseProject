Calling mdoel.trainable = False does not lock weights of model in tensorflow.
Example:
input = Input(batch_shape = (256, 224, 224, 3)
vggNet = VGG16(input_tensor = input, include_top=True)
vggNet.trainable = False
Compiling this model will yield all the parameters from vggNet as if vggNet.trainable = True was set.
I have a couple of ideas on how to fix this. I have posted them here and need feedback before moving forward.
