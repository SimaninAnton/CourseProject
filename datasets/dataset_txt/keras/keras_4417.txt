I have a siamese network with two different sequential models. The networks have the names L and R. I save the overlaying network using the method keras.models.save_model. When loading the network, I'm iteratiing over model.layers to extract my sequential models L and R, but now the models are named sequential_1 and sequential_2. Usually, the layer names are set when loading using the method get_config, but at the class Sequential this seems to work differently. How do I have to change that method in order to save my sequential layers with their given names?
