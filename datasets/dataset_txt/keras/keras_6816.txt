I'm wondering if I could build a multi-task convolutional network. This concept was introduced in Marc'Aurelio's CVPR 2014 tutorial(https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxsc3ZydHV0b3JpYWxjdnByMTR8Z3g6Njg5MmZkZTM1MDhhZWNmZA), 92page, or as below:
In my case, even the number of classes would be different for each task, and I still want to minimise theano-level coding for this.
Any opinion would be appreciated, thanks!
