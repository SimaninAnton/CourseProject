Hey guys,
Is this thing actually supported?:
" Eats inputs with shape:
(nb_samples, max_sample_length (samples shorter than this are padded with zeros at the end), input_dim)
"
The recurrent models only take (input_length, input_dim) sized inputs. Perhaps change the comments to remove this part of the description.
To deal with multiple sequences currently implies merging them into one big sequence and padding them to alignment and I see no other way around it.
