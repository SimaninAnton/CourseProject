Does anyone have an idea how to print all of the losses for a Graph model separately?
I.e. for a graph model with
model.compile({"first_loss" : "categorical_crossentropy", "second_loss" : "mse"}, optimizer="rmsprop")
instead of
33019/33019 [==============================] - 64s - loss: 0.3151
we would have
33019/33019 [==============================] - 64s - first_loss: 0.4151 - second_loss: 0.200
