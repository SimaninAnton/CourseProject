I have a problem like this:
It is a time sequential. At each time, the input is 14-dimension vector, the output is 1 dimension real value. So it is a regression problem. I want to train a fixed length sequence to sequence LSTM. So one input out example (a short sequnce) is X1, X2 ... Xt, the output is Y1, Y2 ...Yt. Note X1 is 14 dimension. I have many short sequences for training.
In the test, I have a fixed length sequence and want to output a result sequence.
How can I model is in keras, particularly how is the shape of the input training data (both features and labels)?
Thanks very much.
