Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to obtain the gradients of the output of the network with respective to the weights. In other words, if we see the network as a big nonlinear function parameterized by the weights
'''tex
out = f(in;\theta)
'''
how to obtain
'''tex
\bigtriangledown_{\theta} f(in)|_{in=some number}
'''
