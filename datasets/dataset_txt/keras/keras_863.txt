Hi, I was training a mobilenet model for image classification. When i load the trainned model, it gave me this error: ValueError: Layer conv_pad_1 was called with an input that isn't a symbolic tensor. Received type: <class 'keras.layers.advanced_activations.ReLU'>. Full input: [<keras.layers.advanced_activations.ReLU object at 0x7f51501b7690>]. All inputs to the layer should be tensors.
I am not sure why it producing this error. I have update tensorflow and keras to its latest version
Keras 2.2.0
tensorflow-gpu 1.9.0
