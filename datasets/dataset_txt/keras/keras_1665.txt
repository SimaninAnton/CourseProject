After upgrading to latest keras version 2.0.8 my previous keras code written for 2.0 no longer works.
I use multiple ImageDataGenerator's since my code takes in multiple images and outputs one. I needed to write my own custom generator that took as input all the images coming from each ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory and preforms some preprocessing.
The custom generator looks like,
def train_generator():
    while True:
        img1 = next(img1_generator)
        img2 = next(img2_generator)
        img_res = next(res_generator)
        # Do some processing
        yield [img1, img4], img_res
The training works if I set use_multiprocessing=False, but gets stuck displaying
epoch 1/10
if I set use_multiprocessing=True.
My batch_size is set to 6 and I've tried different settings for num_workers and max_queue_size, but none worked.
I saw that there were some changes in version 2.0.6 so maybe it broke something.
