Hey all:
My computer will shut down if I use large batch-sizes in Keras. To compare, I also write a naive net in Theano and it is Okay with large batch-sizes. I monitored the GPU power usage, sometimes it exceed maximum 250W (Titan X) when running in Keras. Fan,temp and memory are in good ranges. Is there some optimization behind Keras that using GPU more efficiently? Maybe I need a larger power supply?
Thank you!
