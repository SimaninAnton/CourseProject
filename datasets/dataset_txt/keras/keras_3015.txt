Thank you!
[x ] Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
[x ] If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.
If running on Theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Theano. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).
I have seen that in the latest version of TensorFlow, the Sequence-to-Sequence model has been implemented and added to the library.
Right now, I have not succeeded at loading it into Keras.
I have tried loading the encoder and the decoder of the model in separate Lambda layers, but it does not work with NumPy arrays as its input.
I do not know how I could update the weights of the model either.
Could anyone help me in loading this TensorFlow model into Keras, so I can train it?
Thank you very much
