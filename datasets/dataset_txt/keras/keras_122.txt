Any time I train a NN (using tensorflow with keras) and attempt to plot (matplotlib) the loss history of the fit model, the kernel dies. I do not think it is code because running different code from different validated sources (links below) causes the same problem.
Also, it appears to be specific to tensorflow/keras and matplotlib. If I run an sklearn model and then plot it works fine.

Tried fixes:
Restarting comp
Removing keras and matplotlib
Rolling back matplotlib to a previous version (3.02)
Updating python 3.6 to 3.71
Uninstalling python and anaconda from comp and re-installing 6. Running code in different browser (safari and chrome)
Important
I believe it has something to do with my installation. I sent the notebook and data to someone else with the same exact comp and setup and it worked fine. However, this isn't an isolated incident, as its been reported on stack before.

I've also tried running the py file through the command line to retrieve errors, but nothing happens (no error, no indication that the file is running). Other py files run fine though.
current versions
python - 3.71
matplotlib - 3.0.3
keras - 2.2.4
tensorflow - 1.13.1
